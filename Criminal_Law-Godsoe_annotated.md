Export Customization Tips

We designed this opencasebook.org export using MS Word Styles to
simplify customization. The \"Styles Pane\" in Word\'s \"Home\" tab
shows a list of styles in the document, and the active style of your
current element or selection.

For example, you can quickly change the case text font for the whole
document by modifying the \"Case Body\" style. The style modification
screen also shows which style your style is \"Based On.\" If you modify
the style listed there, all styles based on it will also change. Some
older documents might use different styles than newer ones--- click into
an element and check the Styles Pane to confirm its style.

Introduction to this Casebook and to Criminal Law

 

**Introduction to criminal law and this course**

Welcome to Criminal Law! I find it to be one of the most interesting and
thought-provoking areas of law and I hope that you will too.

[Course materials]{.underline}

I decided to use an open-source casebook for two reasons: First, and
most importantly, to save you the immense cost of another casebook.
Second, I found myself adding more and more content because the lack of
context and discussion of structural inequality in even the best
casebooks was frustrating to me. So you will see here a combination of
cases, along with other readings and sources---perhaps different than
you expected or than you are receiving in your other first semester
classes. I am hugely grateful to numerous colleagues and students for
contributing to this project (please see full credits at the start of
the book). This section in particular relies heavily on the work of my
colleague Alice Ristroph.

I hope that this casebook provides you with an introduction to important
principles of criminal law, as well as an understanding of how issues of
disability, race, sex, gender, and sexual orientation have been treated
by the legal system and actors in the system. The book should also help
you consider how criminal laws reflect societal norms and values (or
those of the \'mainstream\' societal community), how they have
influenced\--and been influenced by\--change in this country, and what
shortcomings continue in modern criminal law and the criminal system. I
hope to invite meaningful discussions about the role of race in the
legal system, and critical thinking about who in society benefits, and
who is harmed, by current laws, policies, and enforcement decisions.

Although the subject of criminal law cannot be taught without the use of
cases and resources that include terrible crimes with distressing
details, I have tried to be thoughtful about the inclusion of difficult
material. I did so to avoid using traumatizing material when it was not
necessary to the purposes of this course. Please try be aware of your
need for breaks and self-care as you proceed through these materials.
This book is obviously a work in progress. As the semester goes on, I
will adapt these materials to match our pace together and to incorporate
current events. I will always post at least two weeks ahead. As we go
along, I welcome your feedback about which cases and other materials are
helpful and which are less so, as well as places where more explanatory
notes would come in handy. Please don't be shy about letting me know
what works and what doesn't or even if you just find typos or other
errors.

A quick note on language. First, as the ABA and other organizations have
advised, I try to use people-first language to remind us of the humanity
of people, particularly those impacted by the criminal system.
Accordingly, I usually say \"person convicted of a crime\" or \"the
accused,\" rather than \"criminal.\" Relatedly, I use the criminal legal
system, instead of the criminal justice system, since I believe the
system is frequently not just, particularly in its racial
disproportionality. As the syllabus discusses in more depth, some cases
and materials may use outdated language, and in class, I or other
students may inadvertently use problematic language. Please let me know
if this happens\--I want to learn from you\--and let us show each other
grace as we are all learning together and trying to listen well to each
other on these difficult topics.

Please also note that the book contains a supplemental resources section
with optional materials, including podcasts. Please feel free to suggest
new ones to me throughout the semester.

[What Is Criminal Law?]{.underline}

Of the various subjects a student encounters in an American law school,
*criminal law* may appear the most familiar. From an early age, every
American is exposed to depictions of various aspects of the criminal
legal system. Police appear in children's books and toys, criminal
investigations and prosecutions are dramatized in television and movies
(who hasn\'t seen at least one episode of *Law and Order*?), and of
course there is frequent media coverage of arrests, trials, and
punishments. Criminal law appears everywhere, in part because in the
United States it *is* nearly everywhere: this country uses criminal
legal interventions with a frequency and severity unmatched in most
other nations, including to address conduct as varied as
prostitution/sex work, killings, homelessness and many more. For this
reason, many of the ideas and terms you encounter in this book will be
ones you're likely to have heard before: *charges*, *conviction*,
*presumption of innocence*, *proof beyond a reasonable doubt*, to give a
few examples---along with terms of critique such as *mass
incarceration*, *racial bias* and *overcriminalization*. (Now might be a
good time to look at the Bruce Western video on this topic).

Nonetheless, media or other cultural depictions of the criminal legal
system are misleading, and these depictions won't teach you to practice
law or even to understand the criminal legal system. This book does
pursue those goals, and others. It seeks to give you an understanding of
American criminal law that will be useful whether you practice in this
field or a different area of law, and indeed, an understanding that will
be useful even if you do not practice law at all. With so much criminal
law everywhere in the United States, understanding how this area of law
operates is crucial for any lawyer (or really any person living here, to
vote, assess policies etc).

Even with the seeming familiarity of criminal law, many students
eventually find the subject to be very different from what they expected
"law" to be. To minimize confusion, it is useful to begin with some
basic descriptions. What makes criminal law the same as other areas of
law? That is, what makes it *law*? And what makes criminal law different
from other areas of law? What makes *criminal* law a distinctive field?

Philosophers have no single answer to the question, *what is law?*, and
dictionaries identify the word as one with multiple meanings. We speak
of the laws of physics, for example, but those statements about the
observed properties of physical objects are very different from the
kinds of laws that one studies in law school. **For the purposes of this
book, law can be understood as a human practice that involves both (1)
authoritative written texts and (2) decisions by public officials**. For
example, a statute that defines "burglary" is a written text, and it is
designed to guide official decisions by police officers, prosecutors,
and judges. Official decisions are only sometimes guided by a prior
written text; sometimes public officials make decisions without
statutory or other written guidance. And official decisions are
sometimes, but only sometimes, recorded in a new written text. Decisions
by police officers and prosecutors are usually unrecorded, whereas
courts (mostly appellate) frequently document and explain their
decisions in written opinions. This latter kind of text, the "case,"
makes up much of law school reading assignments.

But cases are not the only written texts that are important to the
practice of law, and judicial decisions are not the only decisions that
are important to law. In criminal law (and many other fields), statutes
are especially important legal texts. And in criminal law, decisions by
executive branch officials are often determinative of the case outcome.
This is especially true in our current system, where about 95% of cases
plead out, meaning they never get to a jury and have very (usually very
very) minimal judicial review and never appear in published cases. To
give an example, if police and prosecutors decide to search, arrest, and
prosecute people for marijuana possession only in certain neighborhoods
(almost always low-income, disproportionately of color neighborhoods)
and in almost all of those cases people plead out to get out of jail, or
for other reasons, is the statute criminalizing marijuana really making
the law? Or is it actually the police and prosecutors? Hint: the statute
may forbid it, but people in affluent neighborhoods don\'t really have
to worry about having marijuana as they are so unlikely to be searched
that it arguably is not really illegal for them in any meaningful sense.

Here, then, is one way in which criminal law is like other areas of law
that you will encounter in law school: it is a distinctive human
practice that involves the use of written texts to guide, constrain, or
express official decisions and actions. It bears emphasis that the
decisions reached in law are decisions made by human beings. Humans are
rational creatures who might deliberate about moral values, or take into
account empirical evidence, or be influenced by public opinion, or rely
on "common sense" as they make legal decisions. But human rationality is
limited by various factors such as imperfect information and cognitive
biases. Perhaps criminal law is even more shaped by emotion and
cognitive bias than other fields of human law; we will explore that
possibility. Certainly, racial bias is a particularly acute concern in
criminal law. For now, the key point is that legal texts are designed to
guide human decision-making, but the relevant text may not be the only
factor that shapes an official decision. See e.g. the marijuana example
above. What other factors may be influencing police and prosecutor
enforcement policy? Politics (who donates and has clout) including
directives from the Mayor, Police Commissioner or District Attorney?
(Often skewed and sensationalist) media coverage of crime? Police and
prosecutor biases? A desire to get high numbers, of arrests and
convictions, to increase funding for their departments?

A Quick Note on Law versus Policy

Many law students\--or lawyers and people more broadly\--draw a
distinction between supposedly neutral or apolitical \"law\" (as made by
court decision) and political \"policy\" (as enacted by legislatures in
statutes, or by administrative agencies in regulations etc). I believe
that this is a false\--and confusing\-- binary. We know that courts
(look at, for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court in recent times) are
influenced politics to a lesser or greater degree, and that total
neutrality is not really possible. Every law has some underlying moral
judgment, and decisions of how much to follow precedent by analogizing
or distinguishing from other cases, inevitably include normative or
value assessments. For our purposes here, we can think about both law
and policy as being overlapping rules\--there is the statutory rule,
then court decision rule, that interprets and applies the statutes to
particular cases or fact patterns. On top of this we have the
enforcement policies or patterns that make more rules\--arguably the
criminal rules that affect most people. Remember the marijuana example?

Moreover, what lawyers do is argue for their clients\' goals, that a
law/rule does or does not include their case. We will frequently be in
role in class, arguing for conviction or acquittal/dismissal. There is
no \"right answer\" to most law school questions; instead, the best
answer is the law school cliche of \"it depends.\" When reading cases,
try to make the arguments both ways\--that is the best way to do well on
law school exams, and, more importantly, to learn to be a lawyer. The
law is not static, but rather constantly changing, for better or worse.

To this end, for each statute or case we discuss, do not take the
outcome as a given. Sometimes you may agree more with the dissent, or
with the party who didn\'t win. That is fine! I often do. When reading
cases and statutes, and thinking about problems and hypos, consider who
gains and who loses from a certain outcome more broadly than the case at
hand. Good lawyers find a way to argue these kind of distributive
\"policy\" considerations\--or put another way \"slippery slope\"
concerns\--and they often factor into even trial court decisions as well
as, more explicitly, appellate court decisions.

[How is Criminal Law Different Than Other Types of Law?]{.underline}

What (beyond the possibility of unusual effects of bias and emotion)
distinguishes *criminal* law from other fields of aw? Criminal law was
once more commonly called "the law of crimes," and the concept of a
crime may help us identify what is distinctive about criminal law. In
popular culture , the term crime is likely to bring to mind images of
wrongful or harmful acts. Accordingly, it is tempting to think of
criminal law as the law that regulates (by prohibiting) acts of violence
or other inflictions of harm. But in legal terms, a crime is any act
that has been designated as a crime by the appropriate legal actors. We
will consider a wide array of acts designated as criminal and
investigate whether we can identify one or more shared characteristics
of those acts. **Is there an agreed-upon moral or societal definition of
"wrong" or "harm" that predicts which acts will be labeled as crimes?**
**Almost certainly not**, with different communities having varying
views\--think e.g. of drug possession, parents\' corporal punishment of
their children, or jaywalking. The contested definition of wrongs and
harms is true of even the most serious crimes, such as killings of a
person. Self-defense and other justifications and excuses result in
killings being treated very differently.

Whether or not the acts designated as criminal are in fact wrongful or
harmful in all cases, the designation of a person as "a criminal"\--or
someone convicted of a crime\--brings significant negative consequences
to that person. Criminal law is often said to be distinctive in imposing
unique burdens, such as loss of liberty through a jail or prison
sentence. Even when a person convicted of a criminal offense avoids
incarceration, a criminal conviction carries considerable stigma and
often renders a person ineligible for various social benefits including
access to public housing, certain types of employment, and the right to
vote.

Indeed, the burdens of a criminal conviction are a key part of the
distinction between criminal law and tort law. Tort law, which you will
also study this semester, is similar to criminal law in that it imposes
legal liability for conduct designated as wrongful. In fact, the modern
English word "tort" comes from the Latin word *tortum*, meaning wrong or
injustice. Many acts are both crimes and torts, such as intentional
inflictions of physical injury. But tort law is different from criminal
law in at least two key respects. First, the sanctions are different;
tort liability usually means having to pay monetary damages, but it does
not involve potential incarceration or the stigma of a criminal
conviction. Again, criminal law is distinctive in the severity and
stigma of its sanctions. A second way in which tort law is different
from criminal law is that the decision to pursue a tort claim is usually
the choice of a private party, not a public official. Police and
prosecutors decide whether a given individual will be investigated and
charged with a crime, but the party who is harmed by tortious conduct
decides whether to file a tort suit.

Because the burdens of a criminal conviction are seen as more severe
than the burdens typically imposed by non-criminal laws, criminal law
contains various structures designed to limit the imposition of criminal
penalties. For example, criminal punishment is said to require a higher
standard of proof than is required in many other areas of law -- that's
the *beyond a reasonable doubt* standard that you're likely to have
heard of. This is another way in which criminal law differs from tort
law, and it may explain why some defendants are acquitted of criminal
charges but found civilly liable for the same conduct in a tort suit.
(O.J. Simpson is a famous example of this: he was acquitted of the
murders of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman, but Simpson was found
liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil tort suit with a lower
standard of proof.) Today, however, when the vast majority of accused
people finish their cases with a plea 'bargain' rather than after a
trial, some of these procedural protections do not do much work. \*\*Now
might be a good time to look at the two flowcharts in our reading for
class 1, and to think about how these different process stages operate
in theory versus in practice. Both show how complex the system is, but
the 2nd, more critical, flowchart, demonstrates how most people never
get to the adjudication stage\--so the high burden of proof on
prosecutors/the state does not often help them in reality.

[Who 'Makes' Criminal Law?]{.underline}

Throughout this course, we will consider three types of official
decisions that are especially important to criminal law. For any
individual person to be convicted of a crime, each of these three
decisions is necessary. First, the *criminalization* decision is the
choice to define some category of conduct as criminal. Today, this
decision usually must be made by a legislature and expressed in a
criminal statute.

As a result, criminal law is often thought of as the "statutory" first
year course. In other first year courses, judges often explicitly make
the rules. They decide whether a contract is enforceable or whether a
tort defense is available. By contrast in criminal law, the rules are
generally made by the state legislatures. The relevant state (or city or
federal) statute tells us what is forbidden and the courts\' job is to
interpret those statutes to determine whether the defendant has done the
things the legislature has prohibited.

Yet, as we will discuss throughout this semester, **criminal statutes
(or other texts that define activity as criminal) are not
self-enforcing**. For example, as previously discussed, the existence of
a statute that criminalizes the possession of marijuana is not by itself
enough to ensure that all persons who possess marijuana will be
convicted of violating that statute. A second type of decision key to
criminal law is the *enforcement* decision, or the decision by
enforcement agents such as police and prosecutors (from the executive
branch) to arrest or charge a given person. Indeed, given the vast sweep
of criminal laws, and the impossibility of arresting and charging
everyone who commits a certain crime (e.g. shoplifting, marijuana
possession, and many more), the enforcement of a law is arguably
actually "creating" criminal law. The enforcement decision is usually
not just one decision but two decisions or more: the decision by a
police officer to investigate and perhaps arrest a person; the decision
by a prosecutor to charge a particular offense; and in many instances,
later decisions by a prosecutor to add or drop charges as part of a
plea-bargaining process. Unlike the legislative process, these decisions
by prosecutors are very untransparent and hidden from view. This is
starting to change, with a small number of so-called "progressive
prosecutors" publishing data online. We will discuss the power of
prosecutors, and the potential for them\--more than courts and
legislatures\--to drive criminal system reform, throughout this course.
In the meantime, the cartoon under the \"Power of the Prosecutor\" tab
is an illustration of who really makes criminal law today.

Plea bargaining is often (but not always) a precursor to the third key
decision, the *adjudication* decision, in which a formal, and usually
final, decision is made to classify the defendant as guilty or not
guilty. If a criminal case involves a jury trial, then it is the jury
who makes the adjudication decision. Some criminal cases (such as most
of those involving teens, whom I represented as a public defender)
involve bench trials, in which a judge serves as the factfinder and
decides whether to convict the defendant or not. But the vast
majority\--remember around 95 %\--of criminal convictions are based on
guilty pleas rather than jury or bench trials. When a defendant pleads
guilty, it is more difficult to identify the actor who makes the
adjudication decision. It could be said that the defendant himself (or
herself) makes the adjudication decision, since the defendant admits his
own guilt instead of asking a jury or judge to determine guilt. But what
would lead a defendant to do that? In a system that promises that every
defendant will be presumed innocent until proven guilty, why do so many
defendants disclaim their own innocence and relieve prosecutors of their
burden to prove guilt? Hint: think of the Kaleif Browder case discussed
in our class 1 readings\--what pressure does being incarcerated before
trial\--while presumed innocent in theory\--put on people to plead? Most
can\'t pay bail and don\'t want to stay there, and be abused and put in
solitary confinement for years. Others can\'t be jailed for even a short
time or they risk losing their jobs, custody of their children, their
homes. . .

We will explore these questions more throughout the semester. **It will
turn out that *criminalization decisions* and *enforcement decisions*
can create situations in which *adjudication decisions* all but
disappear -- the choice of what to criminalize, and how to enforce those
laws, can make a guilty plea rather than a trial the least terrible
option for many a defendant**. For now, it is important simply to note
that the distinctive standard of proof mentioned above -- proof beyond a
reasonable doubt -- does not actually get tested in most criminal cases.
Prosecutors don't have to "prove" anything if a defendant pleads guilty.

In short, criminal law is a human practice which involves three
important types of decisions: *criminalization*, *enforcement*, and
*adjudication*. We will consider similar questions about each type of
decision: Who makes it? Does the decision have to take a certain form (a
statute, an indictment, a verdict) in order to be recognized as legally
valid? What constraints or criteria apply to the decision, and how does
each decision establish constraints or criteria for other
decisionmakers? (We will also be thinking of the decisionmakers in terms
of the 3 branches of government, and the balance between them).

Conclusion: Criminal Law in Practice

The three other readings for today\--excerpts from Before the Law,
Misdemeanorland, and The New Jim Crow\--show how the criminal system
works on the ground in a world of plea bargaining with no real published
law, and how that intersects with race, class, and other structural
inequality (think eg of people who are undocumented) to limit the
choices, and real process of law, for many people.

Criminal Legal System Flowcharts & Cartoon

 

The American criminal legal system is unique in both its scope and its
organization. Before we start discussing what conduct is criminal (or
whether particular conduct *should* be criminal) it is important to
understand exactly what the criminal legal system is, and why more
people, including me, no longer refer to it as the \"criminal justice
system.\"

Flowchart A: The so-called [leaky pipe
model](https://www.bjs.gov/content/downloadchart.cfm) of the system is
crucial to understanding the practical realities of the administration
of the American system.

The chart is here to give you a sense of the vastness and complexity of
the criminal justice but, as the note indicates, it is not to scale. For

# Excerpt of Before the Law by Jennifer Gonnerman

From the New Yorker 10/6/2014

*Kalief Browder spent more than a thousand days confined on Rikers
Island.*

In the early hours of Saturday, May 15, 2010, ten days before his
seventeenth birthday, Kalief Browder and a friend were returning home
from a party in the Belmont section of the Bronx. They walked along
Arthur Avenue, the main street of Little Italy, past bakeries and cafes
with their metal shutters pulled down for the night. As they passed East
186th Street, Browder saw a police car driving toward them. More squad
cars arrived, and soon Browder and his friend found themselves squinting
in the glare of a police spotlight. An officer said that a man had just
reported that they had robbed him. \"I didn\'t rob anybody,\" Browder
replied. \"You can check my pockets.\"

The officers searched him and his friend but found nothing. As Browder
recalls, one of the officers walked back to his car, where the alleged
victim was, and returned with a new story: the man said that they had
robbed him not that night but two weeks earlier. The police handcuffed
the teens and pressed them into the back of a squad car. \"What am I
being charged for?\" Browder asked. \"I didn\'t do anything!\" He
remembers an officer telling them, \"We\'re just going to take you to
the precinct. Most likely you can go home.\" Browder whispered to his
friend, \"Are you sure *you* didn\'t do anything?\" His friend insisted
that he hadn\'t.

At the Forty-eighth Precinct, the pair were fingerprinted and locked in
a holding cell. A few hours later, when an officer opened the door,
Browder jumped up: \"I can leave now?\" Instead, the teens were taken to
Central Booking at the Bronx County Criminal Court.

Browder had already had a few run-ins with the police, including an
incident eight months earlier, when an officer reported seeing him take
a delivery truck for a joyride and crash into a parked car. Browder was
charged with grand larceny. He told me that his friends drove the truck
and that he had only watched, but he figured that he had no defense, and
so he pleaded guilty.

The judge gave him probation and \"youthful offender\" status, which
insured that he wouldn\'t have a criminal record.

Late on Saturday, seventeen hours after the police picked Browder up, an
officer and a prosecutor interrogated him, and he again maintained his
innocence. The next day, he was led into a courtroom, where he learned
that he had been charged with robbery, grand larceny, and assault. The
judge released his friend, permitting him to remain free while the case
moved through the courts. But, because Browder was still on probation,
the judge ordered him to be held and set bail at three thousand dollars.
The amount was out of reach for his family, and soon Browder found
himself aboard a Department of Correction bus. He fought back panic, he
told me later. Staring through the grating on the bus window, he watched
the Bronx disappear. Soon, there was water on either side as the bus
made its way across a long, narrow bridge to Rikers Island.

Of the eight million people living in New York City, some eleven
thousand are confined in the city\'s jails on any given day, most of
them on Rikers, a four-hundred-acre island in the East River, between
Queens and the Bronx. New Yorkers who have never visited often think of
Rikers as a single, terrifying building, but the island has ten
jails-eight for men, one for women, and one so decrepit that it hasn\'t
housed anyone since 2000.

Male adolescents are confined in the Robert N. Davoren Center-known as
R.N.D.C. When Browder arrived, the jail held some six hundred boys, aged
sixteen to eighteen. Conditions there are notoriously grim. In August of
this year, a report by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
New York described R.N.D.C. as a place with a \"deep-seated culture of
violence,\" where attacks by officers and among inmates are rampant. The
report featured a list of inmate injuries: \"broken jaws, broken orbital
bones, broken noses, long bone fractures, and lacerations requiring
stitches.\"

Browder\'s family could not afford to hire an attorney, so the judge
appointed a lawyer named Brendan O\'Meara to represent him. Browder told
O\'Meara that he was innocent and assumed that his case would conclude
quickly. Even the assistant district attorney handling the prosecution
later acknowledged in court papers that it was a \"relatively
straightforward case.\" There weren\'t hours of wiretaps or piles of
complicated evidence to sift through; there was just the memory of one
alleged victim. But Browder had entered the legal system through the
Bronx criminal courts, which are chronically overwhelmed. Last year, the
*Times,* in an extended expose, described them as \"crippled\" and among
the most backlogged in the country. One reason is budgetary. There are
not nearly enough judges and court staff to handle the workload; in
2010, Browder\' s case was one of five thousand six hundred and
ninety-five felonies that the Bronx District Attorney\'s office
prosecuted. The problem is compounded by defense attorneys who drag out
cases to improve their odds of winning, judges who permit endless
adjournments, prosecutors who are perpetually unprepared. Although the
Sixth Amendment guarantees \"the right to a speedy and public trial,\"
in the Bronx the concept of speedy justice barely exists.

# \*\*\*

Inside R.N.D.C., Browder soon realized that he was not going to make
many friends. He was assigned to a dorm where about fifty teen-age boys
slept in an open room, each with a plastic bucket to store his
possessions in. \"Their conversations bored me,\" he told me. As far as
he could tell, the other inmates were interested only in \"crimes they
committed and girls that they did.\" When Browder asked a guard how
inmates were supposed to get their clothes cleaned, he was told that
they had to wash them themselves. He thought this was a joke until he
noticed other inmates scrubbing their clothes by hand, using their
bucket and jailhouse soap. After he did the same and hung his wet
clothes on the rail of his bed, he wound up with brown rust stains on
his white T-shirt, his socks, and his boxers. That day, he told himself,
\"I don\'t know how I\'m going to live in this place.\"

Browder\'s mother visited every weekend. In the visiting room, he would
hand her his dirty clothes and get a stack of freshly laundered clothes
in return. She also put money in a jail commissary account for him, so
he could buy snacks. He knew that such privileges made him a target for
his fellow-prisoners, who would take any opportunity to empty someone
else\'s bucket of snacks and clothes, so he slept with his head off the
side of his bed, atop his bucket. To survive inside R.N.D.C., he decided
that the best strategy was to keep to himself and to work out. Before
Rikers, he told me, \"every here and there I did a couple pullups or
pushups. When I went in there, that\'s when I decided I wanted to get
big.\"

The dayroom was ruled over by a gang leader and his friends, who
controlled inmates\' access to the prison phones and dictated who could
sit on a bench to watch TV and who had to sit on the floor. \"A lot of
times, I\'d say, \'I\'m not sitting on the floor,\' \" Browder said.
\"And then they\' II come with five or six dudes. They\'d swing on me.
I\'d have to fight back.\" There was no escape, no protection, and a
suspicion that some of the guards had an agreement with the gang
members.

Browder told me that, one night soon after he arrived, a group of guards
lined him and several other inmates up against a wall, trying to figure
out who had been responsible for an earlier fight. \"They\'re talking to
us about why did we jump these guys,\" he said. \"And as they\'re
talking they\'re punching us one by one.\" Browder said that he had
nothing to do with the fight, but still the officers beat him; the other
inmates endured much worse. \"Their noses were leaking, their faces were
bloody, their eyes were swollen,\" he said. Afterward, the officers gave
the teens a choice: go to the medical clinic or go back to bed. But they
made it clear that, if the inmates went to the clinic and told the
medical staff what had happened, they would write up charges against
them, and get them sent to solitary confinement. \"I just told them
I\'ll act like nothing happened,\" Browder said. \"So they didn\'t send
us to the clinic; they didn\'t write anything up; they just sent us
back.\" The Department of Correction refused to respond to these
allegations, or to answer any questions about Browder\'s stay on Rikers.
But the recent U.S. Attorney\'s report about R.N.D.C. recounts many
instances in which officers pressured inmates not to report beatings-to
\"hold it down,\" in Rikers parlance. n the morning of July 28, 2010,
Browder was awakened at around half past four. He was handcuffed to
another inmate and herded onto a bus with a group of other prisoners. At
the Bronx County Hall of Justice, they spent the day in a basement
holding pen, each waiting for his chance to see a judge. When Browder\'s
turn came, an officer led him into a courtroom and he caught a glimpse
of his mother in the spectator area. Seventy-four days had passed since
his arrest. Already he had missed his seventeenth birthday, the end of
his sophomore year, and half the summer.

A grand jury had voted to indict Browder. The criminal complaint alleged
that he and his friend had robbed a Mexican immigrant named Roberto
Bautista-pursuing him, pushing him against a fence, and taking his
backpack. Bautista told the police that his backpack contained a credit
card, a debit card, a digital camera, an iPod Touch, and seven hundred
dollars. Browder was also accused of punching Bautista in the face.

A clerk read out the charges-\"Robbery in the second degree and other
crimes\"-and asked Browder, \"How do you plead, sir, guilty or not
guilty?\"

\"Not guilty,\" Browder said.

An officer escorted him out of the courtroom and back downstairs to
return to Rikers. It no longer mattered whether his mother could find
the money to bail him out. The Department of Probation had filed a
\"violation of probation\" against him-standard procedure when someone
on probation is indicted on a new violent felony-and the judge had
remanded him without bail.

Browder repeatedly told O\'Meara, his court-appointed lawyer, that he
would never plead guilty and that he wanted to go to trial. O\'Meara
assumed that his courtroom defense would be \"Listen, they got the wrong
kid.\" After all, the accusation had been made a week or two after the
alleged

robbery, and the victim had later changed his mind about when it
occurred. (The original police report said \"on or about May 2,\" but
Bautista later told a detective that it happened on May 8th.)

With each day he spent in jail, Browder imagined that he was getting
closer to trial. Many states have so-called speedy-trial laws, which
require trials to start within a certain time frame. New York State\'s
version is slightly different, and is known as the \"ready rule.\" This
rule stipulates that all felony cases (except homicides) must be ready
for trial within six months of arraignment, or else the charges can be
dismissed. In practice, however, this time limit is subject to
technicalities. The clock stops for many reasons-for example, when
defense attorneys submit motions before trial-so that the amount of time
that is officially held to have elapsed can be wildly different from the
amount of time that really has. In 2011, seventy-four per cent of felony
cases in the Bronx were older than six months.

In order for a trial to start, both the defense attorney and the
prosecutor have to declare that they are ready; the court clerk then
searches for a trial judge who is free and transfers the case, and jury
selection can begin. Not long after Browder was indicted, an assistant
district attorney sent the court a \"Notice of Readiness,\" stating that
\"the People are ready for trial.\" The case was put on the calendar for
possible trial on December 10th, but it did not start that day. On
January 28, 2011, Browder\'s two-hundred-and-fifty-eighth day in jail,
he was brought back to the courthouse once again. This time, the
prosecutor said, \"The People are not ready. We are requesting one
week.\" The next court date set by the judge-March 9th-was not one week
away but six. As it happened, Browder didn\'t go to trial anytime that
year. An index card in the court file explains:

June 23, 2011: People not ready, request 1 week.

August 24, 2011: People not ready, request 1 day.

November 4, 2011: People not ready, prosecutor on trial, request 2
weeks. December 2, 2011: Prosecutor on trial, request January 3rd.

The Bronx courts are so clogged that when a lawyer asks for a one-week
adjournment the next court date usually doesn\'t happen for six weeks or
more. As long as a prosecutor has filed a Notice of Readiness, however,
delays caused by court congestion don\'t count toward the number of days
that are officially held to have elapsed. Every time a prosecutor stood
before a judge in Browder\'s case, requested a one-week adjournment, and
got six weeks instead, this counted as only one week against the
six-month deadline. Meanwhile, Browder remained on Rikers, where six
weeks still felt like six weeks-and often much longer.

Like many defendants with court-appointed lawyers, Browder thought his
attorney was not doing enough to help him. O\'Meara, who works mostly in
the Bronx and in Westchester County, never made the trip out to Rikers
to see him, since a visit there can devour at least half a day. To avoid
this trek, some lawyers set up video conferences at the Bronx courthouse
with their clients who are in jail. O\'Meara says he\'s \"pretty sure\"
he did this with Browder, but Browder says he never did. Court papers
suggest a lawyer in a hurry: in the fall of 2010, O\'Meara filed a
notice with the

court in which he mistakenly wrote that he would soon be making a motion
on Browder\'s case in \"Westchester County Court,\" instead of in the
Bronx.

# \*\*\*

For a defendant who is in jail, the more a case drags on the greater the
pressure to give up and plead guilty. By early 2012, prosecutors had
offered Browder a deal-three and a half years in prison in exchange for
a guilty plea. He refused. \"I want to go to trial,\" he told O\'Meara,
even though he knew that if he lost he could get up to fifteen years in
state prison. Stories circulate on Rikers about inmates who plead guilty
to crimes they didn\'t commit just to put an end to their ordeal, but
Browder was determined to get his day in court. He had no idea how rare
trials actually are. In 2011, in the Bronx, only a hundred and
sixty-five felony cases went to trial; in three thousand nine hundred
and ninety-one cases, the defendant pleaded guilty.

Not long after arriving on Rikers, Browder made his first trip to
solitary confinement. It lasted about two weeks, he recalls, and
followed a scuffle with another inmate. \"He was throwing shoes at
people-I told him to stop,\" Browder said. \"I actually took his sneaker
and I threw it, and he got mad. He swung on me, and we started
fighting.\" Browder was placed in shackles and transferred by bus to the
Central Punitive Segregation Unit, which everyone on Rikers calls the
Bing. Housed in one of the island\'s newer jails, the Bing has four
hundred cells, each about twelve feet by seven.

In recent years, the use of solitary confinement has spread in New
York\'s jails. Between 2007 and mid-2013, the total number of
solitary-confinement beds on Rikers increased by more than sixty per
cent, and a report last fall found that nearly twenty-seven per cent of
the adolescent inmates were in solitary. \"I think the department became
severely addicted to solitary confinement,\" Daniel Selling, who served
as the executive director of mental health for New York City\'s jails,
told me in April; he had quit his job two weeks earlier. \"It\'s a way
to control an environment that feels out of control-lock people in their
cell,\" he said. \"Adolescents can\'t handle it. Nobody could handle
that.\" (In March, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed a new jails
commissioner, Joseph Ponte, who promised to \"end the culture of
excessive solitary confinement.\")

For Browder, this was the first of several trips to the Bing. As he soon
discovered, a prisoner there doesn\'t leave his cell except to go to
rec, the shower, the visit room, the medical clinic, or court; whenever
he does leave, he is handcuffed and strip-searched.

# \*\*\*

There hadn\'t been much to do at R.N.D.C., but at least there was
school-classrooms where the inmates were supposed to be taken every day,
to study for a G.E.D. or a high-school diploma.

The Bing had only \"cell study\": a correction officer slid work sheets
under the door in the morning, collected them a few days later, and,
eventually, returned them with a teacher\'s marks. Some inmates never
bothered to fill in the work sheets, but Browder told himself, \"I\'m
already in jail-I might as well keep trying to do something.\" There
were times, however, when nobody came by to collect the work sheets on
the day he\'d been told they were due. If Browder saw a

captain walk by through the small window in his door, he would shout,
\"Where is the school correction officer to pick up the work?\"

Near the end of 2010, Browder returned to the Bing; he was there for
about ten months, through the summer of 2011. He recalls that he got
sent there initially after another fight. (Once an inmate is in
solitary, further minor infractions can extend his stay.) When Browder
first went to Rikers, his brother had advised him to get himself sent to
solitary whenever he felt at risk from other inmates. \"I told him,
\'When you get into a house and you don\'t feel safe, do whatever you
have to to get out,\' \"the brother said. \" \'It\'s better than coming
home with a slice on your

face.\' \"

Even in solitary, however, violence was a threat. Verbal spats with
officers could escalate. At one point, Browder said, \"I had words with
a correction officer, and he told me he wanted to fight. That was his
way of handling it.\" He\'d already seen the officer challenge other
inmates to fights in the shower, where there are no surveillance
cameras. \"So I agreed to it; I said, \'I\'ll fight you.\' \"The next
day, the officer came to escort him to the shower, but before they even
got there, he said, the officer knocked him down: \"He put his forearm
on my face, and my face was on the floor, and he just started punching
me in the leg.\" Browder isn\'t the first inmate to make such an
allegation; the U.S. Attorney\'s report described similar incidents.

Browder\'s brother reconsidered his advice when he saw him in the Bing
visiting area. For one thing, he says, Browder was losing weight.
\"Several times when I visited him, he said, \'They\'re not feeding
me,\' \"the brother told me. \"He definitely looked really skinny.\" In
solitary, food arrived through a slot in the cell door three times a
day. For a growing teen-ager, the portions were never big enough, and in
solitary Browder couldn\'t supplement the rations with snacks bought at
the commissary. He took to begging the officers for leftovers: \"Can I
get that bread?\" Sometimes they would slip him an extra slice or two;
often, they refused.

Browder\'s brother also noticed a growing tendency toward despair. When
Browder talked about his case, he was \"strong, adamant: \'No, they
can\'t do this to me!\' \" But, when the conversation turned to life in
jail, \"it\'s a totally different personality, which is depressed.
He\'s, like, \'I don\'t know how long I can take this.\' \"

Browder got out of the Bing in the fall of 2011, but by the end of the
year he was back-after yet another fight, he says. On the night of
February 8, 2012-his six-hundred-and-thirty-fourth day on Rikers-he said
to himself, \"I can\'t take it anymore. I give up.\" That night, he tore
his bedsheet into strips, tied them together to make a noose, attached
it to the light fixture, and tried to hang himself. He was taken to the
clinic, then returned to solitary. Browder told me that his sheets,
magazines, and clothes were removed-everything except his white plastic
bucket.

On February 17th, he was shuttled to the courthouse once again, but this
time he was not brought up from the court pen in time to hear his case
called. (\"I\'ll waive his appearance for today\'s purposes,\" his
lawyer told the judge.) For more than a year, he had heard various
excuses about why his trial had to be delayed, among them that the
prosecutor assigned to the case was on trial elsewhere, was on jury
duty, or, as he once told the judge, had \"conflicts in my schedule.\"
If Browder had been in the courtroom on this day, he would have heard a
prosecutor offer a new

excuse: \"Your Honor, the assigned assistant is currently on vacation.\"
The prosecutor asked for a five-day adjournment; Browder\'s lawyer
requested March 16th, and the judge scheduled the next court date for
then.

The following night, in his solitary cell on Rikers, Browder shattered
his plastic bucket by stomping on it, then picked up a piece, sharpened
it, and began sawing his wrist. He was stopped after an officer saw him
through the cell window and intervened.

Browder was still on Rikers Island in June of 2012, when his high-school
classmates collected their diplomas, and in September, when some of them
enrolled in college. In the fall, prosecutors offered him a new deal: if
he pleaded guilty, he\'d get two and a half years in prison, which meant
that, with time served, he could go home soon. \"Ninety-nine out of a
hundred would take the offer that gets you out of jail,\" O\'Meara told
me. \"He just said, \'Nah, I\'m not taking it.\' He didn\'t flinch.
Never talked about it. He was not taking a plea.\"

Meanwhile, Browder kept travelling from Rikers to the Bronx courthouse
and back again, shuttling between two of New York City\'s most
dysfunctional bureaucracies, each system exacerbating the flaws of the
other. With every trip Browder made to the courthouse, another line was
added to a growing stack of index cards kept in the court file:

June 29, 2012: People not ready, request one week. September 28, 2012:
People not ready, request two weeks. November 2, 2012: People not ready,
request one week.

December 14, 2012: People not ready, request one week.

By the end of 2012, Browder had been in jail for nine hundred and
sixty-one days and had stood before eight different judges. He always
maintained his composure, never berating his attorney or yelling
protests in court. O\'Meara was impressed by his control. \"I can\'t
imagine most people sitting in there for three years and not becoming
very upset with their attorney,\" he says. \"He just never complained to
me.\" Privately, though, Browder was angry. About the prosecutors, he
would tell himself, \"These guys are just playing with my case.\"

On March 13, 2013, Browder appeared before a new judge, Patricia M.
DiMango, who had been transferred from Brooklyn as part of a larger
effort to tackle the Bronx\'s backlog. She was known for her no-nonsense
style when dealing with defendants; at the Brooklyn courthouse, she was
referred to as Judge Judy. (As it happens, this year she became a judge
on \"Hot Bench,\" a new courtroom TV show created by Judge Judy.) In the
Bronx, DiMango\'s job was to review cases and clear them: by getting
weak cases dismissed, extracting guilty pleas from defendants, or
referring cases to trial in another courtroom. At the start of 2013,
there were nine hundred and fifty-two felony cases in the Bronx,
including Browder\'s, that were more than two years old. In the next
twelve months, DiMango disposed of a thousand cases, some as old as five
years.

Judge DiMango explained to Browder, \"If you go to trial and lose, you
could get up to fifteen.\" Then she offered him an even more tempting
deal: plead guilty to two misdemeanors-the equivalent of sixteen months
in jail-and go home now, on the time already served. \"If you want that,
I will do that today,\" DiMango said. \"I could sentence you today. . .
It\'s up to you.\"

\"I\'m all right,\" Browder said. \"I did not do it. I\'m allright.\"
\"You are all right?\" DiMango said.

\"Yes,\" he said. \"I want to go to trial.\"

Back at Rikers, other prisoners were stunned. \"You\'re bugging,\" they
told him. \"You\'re stupid. If that was me, I would\'ve said I did it
and went home.\" Browder knew that it was a gamble; even though he was
innocent, he could lose at trial. \"I used to go to my cell and lie down
and think, like, Maybe I am crazy; maybe I am going too far,\" he
recalled. \"But I just did what I thought was right.\"

On May 29th, the thirty-first court date on Browder\'s case, there was
another development. DiMango peered down from the bench. \"The District
Attorney is really in a position right now where they cannot proceed,\"
she said. \"It is their intention to dismiss the case.\" She explained
that this could not officially happen until the next court date, which
ended up being a week later. \"I will release you today, but you have to
come back here on time without any new cases,\" she said. \"Do you think
you can do that, Mr. Browder?\"

\"Yes,\" he said.

Browder could not believe what was happening. His battle to prove his
innocence had ended. No trial, no jury, no verdict. An assistant
district attorney filed a memo with the court explaining that Bautista,
the man who had accused Browder, had gone back to Mexico. The District
Attorney\'s office had reached his brother in the Bronx and tried to
arrange for him to return and testify, but then the office lost contact
with the brother, too. \"Without the Complainant, we are unable to meet
our burden of proof at trial,\" the prosecutor wrote.

Browder had to spend one more night on Rikers. By now, he had missed his
junior year of high school, his senior year, graduation, the prom. He
was no longer a teen-ager; four days earlier, he had turned twenty.

He didn\'t know what time he would be released, so he told his mother
not to bother picking him up. The next afternoon, he walked out of jail,
a single thought in his mind: \"I\'m going home!\" He took the bus to
Queens Plaza, then two subways to the Bronx, and his euphoria began to
dissipate. Being around so many people felt strange. Except for a few
weeks, he had been in solitary confinement for the previous seventeen
months.

After leaving Rikers, Browder moved back home, where his mother and two
of his brothers were living. Everybody could see that he had changed.
Most of the clothes in his bedroom no longer fit; he had grown an inch
or two while he was away and had become brawnier. Many of his

former pastimes-playing video games, watching movies, shooting hoops in
the park-no longer engaged him. He preferred to spend time by himself,
alone in his bedroom, with the door closed. Sometimes he found himself
pacing, as he had done in solitary. When he saw old friends, he was
reminded of their accomplishments and what he had not achieved: no
high-school diploma, no job, no money, no apartment of his own.

Before he went to jail, he used to like sitting on his front steps with
his friends, and when a group of attractive girls walked by he\'d call
out, \"Hi. What are you doing? Where\'s the party at? Can I go with
you?\" Now, if he managed to get a girl\'s number, the first real
conversation would always go the same way: she would ask him ifhe was in
school or working, and he would feel his anxiety rise. Once he revealed
that he was still living at home, without a job or a diploma, \"they
look at me like I ain\'t worth nothing. Like I ain\'t shit. It hurts to
have people look at you like that.\" He could explain that he\'d been
wrongfully arrested, but the truth felt too complicated, too raw and
personal. \"If I tell them the story, then I gotta hear a hundred
questions,\" he said. \"It gets emotional for me. And those emotions I
don\'t feel comfortable with.\"

Not long after Browder returned home, one of his relatives called an
attorney named Paul V. Prestia and told him that Browder had spent three
years on Rikers only to have his case dismissed. \"Send him down,\"
Prestia said. A former prosecutor in Brooklyn, Prestia now has his own
firm. On his office wall hangs a 2011 *Post* story about a Haitian chef
from the Bronx who was mistakenly arrested for rape and spent eight days
on Rikers; Prestia got the case dismissed.

When Prestia first heard Browder\'s story, he thought there must be a
catch; even by the sorry standards of justice in the Bronx, the case was
extreme. \"It\'s something that could\'ve been tried in a court in a
matter of days,\" he told me. \"I don\'t know how each and every
prosecutor who looked at this case continued to let this happen. It\'s
like Kalief Browder didn\'t even exist.\" Earlier this year, Prestia
filed a suit on Browder\'s behalf against the city, the N.Y.P.D., the
Bronx District Attorney, and the Department of Correction.

Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx District Attorney, will not answer
questions about Browder\'s case, because, once the charges were
dismissed, the court records were sealed. But recently when I asked him
a general question about cases that drag on and on, he was quick to
deflect blame. \"These long delays-two, three years-they\'re horrendous,
but the D.A. is not really accountable for that kind of delay,\" he
said. His explanation was that either the case did not actually exceed
the six-month speedy-trial deadline or the defense attorney failed to
bring a speedy-trial motion.

Prestia, in his lawsuit, alleges \"malicious prosecution,\" charging
that Johnson\'s prosecutors were \"representing to the court that they
would be \'ready\' for trial, when in fact, they never were.\" Prestia
said, \"The million-dollar question is: When did they really know they
didn\'t have a witness? Did they really not know until 2013?\" He
suspects that, as he wrote in his complaint, they were \"seeking long,
undue adjournments of these cases to procure a guilty plea from
plaintiff.\" The city has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, and
Johnson, when I asked about these accusations, said, \"Certainly if
there is something uncovered that we did wrong, I will deal with that
here. But I don\'t expect that to be the case.\"

Prestia has represented many clients who were wrongfully arrested, but
Browder\'s story troubles him most deeply. \"Kalief was deprived of his
right to a fair and speedy trial, his education, and, I would even
argue, his entire adolescence,\" he says. \"If you took a
sixteen-year-old kid and locked him in a room for twenty-three hours,
your son or daughter, you\'d be arrested for endangering the welfare of
a child.\" Browder doesn\'t know exactly how many days he was in
solitary-and Rikers officials, citing pending litigation, won\'t divulge
any details about his

stay-but he remembers that it was \"about seven hundred, eight
hundred.\"

One day last November, six months after his release, Browder retreated
to his bedroom with a steak knife, intending to slit his wrists. A
friend happened to stop by, saw the knife, and grabbed it. When he left
the house to find Browder\'s mother, Browder tried to hang himself from
a banister. An ambulance rushed him to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he
was admitted to the psychiatric ward. In his medical record, a social
worker describes the suicide attempt as \"serious.\"

One afternoon this past spring, I sat with Browder in a quiet restaurant
in lower Manhattan. He is five feet seven, with a high forehead, tired
eyes, and a few wisps of hair above his upper lip. \"Being home is way
better than being in jail,\" he told me. \"But in my mind right now I
feel like I\'m still in jail, because I\'m still feeling the side
effects from what happened in there.\"

# \*\*\*

This month, Browder started classes at Bronx Community College. But,
even now, he thinks about Rikers every day. He says that his flashbacks
to that time are becoming more frequent. Almost anything can trigger
them. It might be the sight of a police cruiser or something more
innocuous. When his mother cooks rice and chili, he says, he can\'t help
remembering the rice and chili he was fed on Rikers, and suddenly, in
his mind, he is back in the Bing, recalling how hungry he was all the
time, especially at night, when he\'d have to wait twelve hours for his
next meal.

Even with his friends, things aren\'t the same. \"I\'m trying to break
out of my shell, but I guess there is no shell. I guess this is just how
I am-I\'m just quiet and distant,\" he says. \"I don\'t like being this
way, but it\'s just natural to me now.\" Every night before he goes to
sleep, he checks that every window in the house is locked. When he rides
the subway, he often feels terrified. \"I might be attacked; I might be
robbed,\" he says. \"Because, believe me, in jail you know there\'s all
type of criminal stuff that goes on.\" No matter how hard he tries, he
cannot forget what he saw: inmates stealing from each other, officers
attacking teens, blood on the dayroom floor. \"Before I went to jail, I
didn\'t know about a lot of stuff, and, now that I\'m aware, I\'m
paranoid,\" he says. \"I feel like I was robbed of my happiness.\"♦

Theories of Punishment

 

\_Theories of Punishment

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The justifications for criminal punishment historically fall into two
categories: consequentialist and non-consequentialist. In this course,
we will also consider a third theory of punishment, that of social
control.

Consequentialist theories of punishment, which expect the use of
criminal sanction to reduce crime, typically consist of:

1.  Incapacitation \-- taking away the defendant\'s capacity to commit
    new crimes by depriving her of either her freedom or life. The
    defendant is made incapable of further offending.

2.  Deterrence \-- the imposition of negative consequences to convince
    either the individual punished, or the public more generally, that
    crime does not pay. The former is referred to as specific
    deterrence, the latter as general deterrence.

3.  Rehabilitation \-- the idea that separating the individual from
    society will give them the opportunity to change their criminal
    ways. Though it has fallen into disfavor in recent years, this
    theory had great sway in the creation of early penological
    institutions \-- think about reformatories or penitentiaries as
    places where rehabilitation could occur.

Jeremy Bentham is regarded as one of the founders of the utilitarian
(consequentialist) view. He maintained that law is meant to increase the
total happiness of a community; thus, it should serve to exclude things
that would take away from this happiness: mischief. However, he also
believed all punishment is mischief, and therefore, all punishment is
evil. So, punishment should only be administered to exclude a greater
evil than that punishment itself. *Jeremy Bentham, An Introduction to
the Principles of Morals and Legislations (originally published in
1789), in Bentham & Mill, The Utilitarians 162, 166 (Dolphin Books,
1961)*. Bentham also believed punishment should be proportionate to the
crime.  *Jeremy Bentham, Principles of Penal Law, Pt. II, bk. 1, ch. 3,
in J Bentham's Works, 396, 402 (J. Bowring, ed., 1843)*.

In contrast, the principal non-consequentialist theory is that of
retribution. Here, the idea is not to reduce crime \-- through reduced
opportunity or reduced inclination to commit crimes \-- but simply to
dole out "just deserts." Retribution is idea that fairness requires
punishment for proven crimes.

Immanuel Kant, a fierce proponent of retribution, held that punishment
is not just a mere means to promote good within the individual or civil
society; rather, it is imposed because the person has committed a crime.
Retaliation is a just penalty against one who commits a crime, as all
other standards are wavering and uncertain, and retaliation allows for
pure and strict justice. *Immanuel Kant, The Philosophy of Law (W.
Hastie trans., 1887) (originally published in 1797)*.

Professor Michael S. Moore contends the retributivist view punishes
solely because the offender deserves to be punished. Retributivists have
to answer the "how much" and "what type" questions for specific
offenses, committed to the concept that punishment should be
proportionate, but they are not committed to any particular penalty
scheme. Further, the fact that a punishment may curtail a crime is an
added benefit, but is not part of the justification for punishment.
Rather, punishment is used to punish a wrongdoer, even if the crime is
victimless. *Michael S. Moore, The Moral Worth of Retribution, in
Responsibility, Character and Emotions 179 (F. Schoeman ed., 1987)*.

For a modern application of these principles, see *United States v.
Bernard L. Madoff*, United States District Court, S.D.N.Y. (June 29,
2009). After pleading guilty, the Court sentenced Madoff to 150 years in
jail (the maximum sentence), even though he was 71 years old at the time
and had a limited life expectancy. Justice Chin stated this sentence is
symbolic. First, in terms of retribution, Justice Chin declared that a
message had to be sent to show Madoff got "what he deserves," and he
will be punished according to his moral culpability. Second, in terms of
deterrence, it was important to the Court to send the message that those
who may engage in similar conduct will be punished to the fullest extent
of the law. Finally, the Court noted this sentence is important to the
victims, who were betrayed by Madoff, who were "ordinary people" who
worked hard to save their money and who believed they were investing
their money safely.

In recent decades, as the U.S. has become the world's leading jailer,
using criminal law to try to (ineffectively) address societal problems
such as addiction, mental illness, and homelessness, numerous
philosophers and legal scholars have argued that the criminal law
operates as a way to control and subjugate marginalized communities,
particularly low-income people of color. This theory of punishment is
very persuasive to me, yet is still missing from most traditional
criminal law casebooks. Many of the sources we read in these early
classes, such as *Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow*, illustrate
this theory and its historical connection to other racialized systems of
social control such as slavery and the displacement and killing of
indigenous communities.

As we read cases this semester, keep these theories in mind and ask
yourself whether you can see them playing out in the courts\' opinions
and legislatures' justification for criminalizing certain conduct. Also,
engaging in our critical stance, ask yourself if those stated
justifications adequately explain the decisions of legislatures and
courts, or whether something else---social control?---might be acting
below the surface.

Regina v. Dudley & Stephens

 

### *Regina v. Dudley & Stephens*

Queen's Bench Division

14 Q.B.D. 273 (1884)

 

LORD COLERIDGE, C J.  The two prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edwin
Stephens, were indicted for the murder of Richard Parker on the high
seas on the 25th of July in the present year.  They were tried before my
Brother Huddleston at Exeter on the 6th of November, and, under the
direction of my learned Brother, the jury returned a special verdict,
the legal effect of which has been argued before us, and on which we are
now to pronounce judgment.  The special verdict . . . is as follows.

That on July 5, 1884, the prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edward \[sic\]
Stephens, with one Brooks, all able-bodied English seamen, and the
deceased also an English boy, between seventeen and eighteen years of
age, the crew of an English yacht, a registered English vessel, were
cast away in a storm on the high seas 1,600 miles from the Cape of Good
Hope, and were compelled to put into an open boat belonging to the said
yacht.  That in this boat they had no supply of water and no supply of
food, except two 1 lb. tins of turnips, and for three days they had
nothing else to subsist upon.  That on the fourth day they caught a
small turtle, upon which they subsisted for a few days, and this was the
only food they had up to the twentieth day when the act now in question
was committed.  That on the twelfth day the remains of the turtle were
entirely consumed, and for the next eight days they had nothing to eat. 
That they had no fresh water, except such rain as they from time to time
caught in their oilskin capes.  That the boat was drifting on the ocean,
and was probably more than 1000 miles away from land.  That on the
eighteenth day, when they had been seven days without food and five
without water, the prisoners spoke to Brooks as to what should be done
if no succour came, and suggested that some one should be sacrificed to
save the rest, but Brooks dissented, and the boy, to whom they were
understood to refer, was not consulted.  That on the 24th of July, the
day before the act. now in question., the prisoner Dudley proposed to
Stephens and Brooks that lots should be cast who should be put to death
to save the rest, but Brooks refused to consent, and it was not put to
the boy, and in point of fact there was no drawing of lots.  That on the
day the prisoners spoke of their families, and suggested it would be
better to kill the boy that their lives should be saved, and Dudley
proposed that if there was no vessel in sight by the morrow morning the
boy should be killed.  That next day, the 25th of July, no vessel
appearing, Dudley told Brooks that he had better go and have a sleep,
and made signs to Stephens and Brooks that the boy had better be
killed.  The prisoner Stephens agreed to the act, but Brooks dissented
from it.  That the boy was then lying at the bottom of the boat quite
helpless and extremely weakened by famine and by drinking sea water, and
unable to make any resistance, nor did he ever assent to his being
killed.  The prisoner Dudley offered a prayer asking forgiveness for
them all if either of them should be tempted to commit a rash act, and
that their souls might be saved.  That Dudley, with the assent of
Stephens, went to the boy, and telling him that his time was come, put a
knife into his throat and killed him then and there; that the three men
fed upon the body and blood of the boy for four days; that on the fourth
day after the act had been committed the boat was picked up by a passing
vessel, and the prisoners were rescued, still alive, but in the lowest
state of prostration.  That they were carried to the port of Falmouth,
and committed for trial at Exeter.  That if the men had not fed upon the
body of the boy they would probably not have survived to be so picked up
and rescued, but would within four days have died of famine.  That the
boy, being in a much weaker condition, was likely to have died before
them.  That at the time of the act in question there was no sail in
sight, nor any reasonable prospect of relief.  That under these
circumstances there appeared to the prisoners every probability that
unless they then fed or very soon fed upon the boy or one of themselves
they would die of starvation.  That there was no appreciable chance of
saving life except by killing someone for the others to eat.  That
assuming any necessity to kill anybody, there was no greater necessity
for killing the boy than any of the other three men.  But whether upon
the whole matter by the jurors found the killing of Richard Parker by
Dudley and Stephens be felony and murder the jurors are ignorant, and
pray the advice of the Court thereupon, and if upon the whole matter the
Court shall be of opinion that the killing of Richard Parker be felony
and murder, then the jurors say that Dudley and Stephens were each
guilty of felony and murder as alleged in the indictment. . . .

From these facts, stated with the cold precision of a special verdict,
it appears sufficiently that the prisoners were subject to terrible
temptation, to sufferings which might break down the bodily power of the
strongest man, and try the conscience of the best.  Other details yet
more harrowing, facts still more loathsome and appalling, were presented
to the jury, and are to be found recorded in my learned Brother\'s
notes.  But nevertheless this is clear, that the prisoners put to death
a weak and unoffending boy upon the chance of preserving their own lives
by feeding upon his flesh and blood after he was killed, and with the
certainty of depriving him of any possible chance of survival.  The
verdict finds in terms that \"if the men had not fed upon the body of
the boy they would probably not have survived,\" and that \"the boy
being in a much weaker condition was likely to have died before them.\" 
They might possibly have been picked up next day by a passing ship; they
might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is
obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and
profitless act.  It is found by the verdict that the boy was incapable
of resistance, and, in fact, made none; and it is not even suggested
that his death was due to any violence on his part attempted against, or
even so much as feared by, those who killed him.  Under these
circumstances the jury say that they are ignorant whether those who
killed him were guilty of murder, and have referred it to this Court to
determine what is the legal consequence which follows from the facts
which they have found. . . .

\[T\]he real question in the case \[is\] whether killing under the
circumstances set forth in the verdict be or not be murder.  The
contention that it could be anything else was, to the minds of us all,
both new and strange, and we stopped the Attorney General in his
negative argument in order that we might hear what could be said in
support of a proposition which appeared to us to be at once dangerous,
immoral, and opposed to all legal principle and analogy. . . . First it
is said that it follows from various definitions of murder in books of
authority, which definitions imply, if they do not state, the doctrine,
that in order to save your own life you may lawfully take away the life
of another, when that other is neither attempting nor threatening yours,
nor is guilty of any illegal act whatever towards you or anyone else. 
But if these definitions be looked at they will not be found to sustain
this contention. . . .

It is . . . clear . . . that the doctrine contended for receives no
support from the great authority of Lord Hale.  It is plain that in his
view the necessity which justified homicide is that only which has
always been and is now considered a justification. . . . Lord Hale
regarded the private necessity which justified, and alone justified, the
taking the life of another for the safeguard of one\'s own to be what is
commonly called \"self defence.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, i. 478.)

But if this could be even doubtful upon Lord Hale\'s words, Lord Hale
himself has made it clear. For in the chapter in which he deals with the
exemption created by compulsion or necessity he thus expresses himself
\-- \"If a man be desperately assaulted and in peril of death, and
cannot otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his assailant\'s fury, he
will kill an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force
will not acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit
the fact \[sic\], for he ought rather to die himself than kill an
innocent; but if he cannot otherwise save his own life the law permits
him in his own defence to kill the assailant, for by the violence of the
assault, and the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself,
the law of nature, and necessity, hath made him his own protector. . .
.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, vol. i. 51.)

But, further still, Lord Hale in the following chapter deals with the
position asserted by the casuists, and sanctioned, as he says, by
Grotius and Puffendorf, that in a case of extreme necessity, either of
hunger or clothing; \"theft is no theft, or at least not punishable as
theft, as some even of our own lawyers have asserted the same.\" 
\"But,\" says Lord Hale, \"I take it that here in England, that rule, at
least by the laws of England, is false; and therefore, if a person,
being under necessity for want of victuals or clothes, shall upon that
account clandestinely and animo furandi\* steal another man\'s goods, it
is felony, and a crime by the laws of England punishable with death.\" 
(Hale, Pleas of the Crown, i. 54.)  If, therefore, Lord Hale is clear
\-- as he is \-- that extreme necessity of hunger does not justify
larceny, what would he have said to the doctrine that it justified
murder?  \[The opinion then reviewed other legal commentators and found
that none of them supported the defendants\' contentions.\]

Is there, then, any authority for the proposition which has been
presented to us?  Decided cases there are none. . . . The American case
\[United States v. Holmes, 26 F. Cas. 360, 1 Wall. Jr. 1 (C.C.E.D. Pa.
1842)\] in which it was decided, correctly indeed, that sailors had no
right to throw passengers overboard to save themselves, but on the
somewhat strange ground that the proper mode of determining who was to
be sacrificed was to vote upon the subject by ballot, can hardly be an
authority satisfactory to a court in this country. . . .

The one real authority of former time is Lord Bacon, who . . . lays down
the law as follows:  \"Necessity carrieth a privilege in itself.
Necessity is of three sorts \-- necessity of conservation of life,
necessity of obedience, and necessity of the act of God or of a
stranger.  First of conservation of life; if a man steals viands to
satisfy his present hunger, this is no felony nor larceny.  So if divers
be in danger of drowning by the casting away of some boat or barge, and
one of them get to some plank, or on the boat\'s side to keep himself
above water, and another to save his life thrust him from it, whereby he
is drowned, this is neither se defendendo nor by misadventure, but
justifiable.\" . . . Lord Bacon was great even as a lawyer; but it is
permissible to much smaller men, relying upon principle and on the
authority of others, the equals and even the superiors of Lord Bacon as
lawyers, to question the soundness of his dictum.  There are many
conceivable states of things in which it might possibly be true, but if
Lord Bacon meant to lay down the broad proposition that man may save his
life by killing, if necessary, an innocent and unoffending neighbour, it
certainly is not law at the present day. . . .

Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and
unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified
by some well recognised excuse admitted by the law.  It is further
admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing
was justified by what has been called \"necessity.\"  But the temptation
to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called
necessity.  Nor is this to be regretted.  Though law and morality are
not the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily
illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal
consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder
in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it.  It is
not so.  To preserve one\'s life is generally speaking a duty, but it
may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it.  War is full
of instances in which it is a man\'s duty not to live, but to die.  The
duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the
passengers, of soldiers to women and children; these duties impose on
men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice
of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is
to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not
shrunk.  It is not correct, therefore, to say that there is any absolute
or unqualified necessity to preserve one\'s life.  *Necesse est ut eam,
non ut vivam*,† is a saying of a Roman officer quoted by Lord Bacon
himself with high eulogy in the very chapter on necessity to which so
much reference has been made.  It would be a very easy and cheap display
of commonplace learning to quote from Greek and Latin authors, from
Horace, from Juvenal, from Cicero, from Euripides, passage after
passage, in which the duty of dying for others has been laid down in
glowing and emphatic language as resulting from the principles of
heathen ethics; it is enough in a Christian country to remind ourselves
of the Great Example whom we profess to follow.  It is not needful to
point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been
contended for.  Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity?  By
what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to
be strength, or intellect, or what?  It is plain that the principle
leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which
will justify him in deliberately taking another\'s life to save his own.
In this case the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting, was
chosen.  Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? 
The answer must be \"No\" \--

*So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,*\
*The tyrant\'s plea, excused his devilish deeds.*

It is not suggested that in this particular case the deeds were
\"devilish,\" but it is quite plain that such a principle once admitted
might be made the legal cloak for unbridled passion and atrocious
crime.  There is no safe path for judges to tread but to ascertain the
law to the best of their ability and to declare it according to their
judgment; and if in any case the law appears to be too severe on
individuals, to leave it to the Sovereign to exercise that prerogative
of mercy which the Constitution has entrusted to the hands fittest to
dispense it.

It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an
excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how
awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment
straight and the conduct pure.  We are often compelled to set up
standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we
could not ourselves satisfy.  But a man has no right to declare
temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it,
nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner
the legal definition of the crime.  It is therefore our duty to declare
that the prisoners\' act in this case was willful murder, that the facts
as stated in the verdict are no legal justification of the homicide; and
to say that in our unanimous opinion the prisoners are upon this special
verdict guilty of murder.‡

and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a
dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty
presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief,
expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves
liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent
dimensions.

    The question before the Court is the validity of a Texas statute
making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain
intimate sexual conduct.

    In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department
were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons
disturbance. They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners,
John Geddes Lawrence, resided. The right of the police to enter does not
seem to have been questioned. The officers observed Lawrence and another
man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act. The two petitioners were
arrested, held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a
Justice of the Peace.

    The complaints described their crime as "deviate sexual intercourse,
namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man)." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 127a, 139a. The applicable state law is Tex. Penal Code Ann.
§21.06(a) (2003). It provides: "A person commits an offense if he
engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the
same sex." The statute defines "\[d\]eviate sexual intercourse" as
follows:

"(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the
mouth or anus of another person; or

"(B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with
an object." §21.01(1).

    The petitioners exercised their right to a trial *de novo* in Harris
County Criminal Court. They challenged the statute as a violation of the
Equal Protection Clause of the [Fourteenth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv) and
of a like provision of the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const., Art. 1, §3a.
Those contentions were rejected. The petitioners, having entered a plea
of *nolo contendere*, were each fined \$200 and assessed court costs of
\$141.25. \[Petitioners appeal, alleging

   federal constitutional arguments under both the Equal Protection and
Due Process Clauses of the [Fourteenth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv)\].

 

    ...

    The petitioners were adults at the time of the alleged offense.
Their conduct was in private and consensual.

    We conclude the case should be resolved by determining whether the
petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the
exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of
the [Fourteenth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv) to
the Constitution. For this inquiry we deem it necessary to reconsider
the Court's holding in *Bowers*.

    There are broad statements of the substantive reach of liberty under
the Due Process Clause in earlier cases, including *Pierce* v. *Society
of Sisters,* [268 U.S.
510](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?268+510) (1925),
and *Meyer* v. *Nebraska,* [262 U.S.
390](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?262+390) (1923);
but the most pertinent beginning point is our decision
in *Griswold* v. *Connecticut,* [381 U.S.
479](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?381+479) (1965).

    In *Griswold* the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the use
of drugs or devices of contraception and counseling or aiding and
abetting the use of contraceptives. The Court described the protected
interest as a right to privacy and placed emphasis on the marriage
relation and the protected space of the marital bedroom. *Id.,* at 485.

    After *Griswold* it was established that the right to make certain
decisions regarding sexual conduct extends beyond the marital
relationship. In *Eisenstadt* v. *Baird,* [405 U.S.
438](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?405+438) (1972),
the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of
contraceptives to unmarried persons.

 

...

 

    In *Carey* v. *Population Services Int'l,* [431 U.S.
678](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?431+678) (1977),
the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of
contraceptive devices to persons under 16 years of age. Although there
was no single opinion for the Court, the law was invalidated.
Both *Eisenstadt* and *Carey*, as well as the holding and rationale
in *Roe*, confirmed that the reasoning of *Griswold* could not be
confined to the protection of rights of married adults. This was the
state of the law with respect to some of the most relevant cases when
the Court considered *Bowers* v. *Hardwick* \[a prior case which upheld
a criminal ban on sodomy\].

 

...

The laws involved in *Bowers* and here are, to be sure, statutes that
purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act. Their
penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences,
touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in
the most private of places, the home. The statutes do seek to control a
personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal
recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose
without being punished as criminals.

    This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the
State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set
its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the
law protects. It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose
to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their
own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. When
sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another
person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is
more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows
homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

 

. . .

\[Historically\] laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been
enforced against consenting adults acting in private. A substantial
number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are
surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or
did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.
As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would
be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did
not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law. Thus the model
sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2
Chitty, *supra, *at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man
against a minor girl or minor boy. Instead of targeting relations
between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions
typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys,
relations between adults involving force, relations between adults
implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.

 

. . .

    It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in *Bowers* was
making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful
voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has
been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable
behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these
are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as
ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus
determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer
the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may
use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society
through operation of the criminal law. "Our obligation is to define the
liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code." *Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pa.* v. *Casey,* [505 U.S.
833](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?505+833), 850
(1992).

    Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court
in *Bowers* and further explained his views as follows: "Decisions of
individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state
intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.
Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian
moral and ethical standards." 478 U.S., at 196. . . . \[W\]e think that
our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance
here. These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives
substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their
private lives in matters pertaining to sex.

    This emerging recognition should have been apparent
when *Bowers* was decided. In 1955 the American Law Institute
promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not
recommend or provide for "criminal penalties for consensual sexual
relations conducted in private." ALI, Model Penal Code §213.2, Comment
2, p. 372 (1980). It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The
prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many
people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not
harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus
invited the danger of blackmail. ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary
277---280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955). In 1961 Illinois changed its laws
to conform to the Model Penal Code. Other States soon followed. Brief
for Cato Institute as *Amicus* *Curiae* 15---16.

 

...

    Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect
for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked
in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both
interests. If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does
so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might
remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection
reasons. When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the
State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject
homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the
private spheres. . .

    The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial.
The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense
in the Texas legal system. Still, it remains a criminal offense with all
that imports for the dignity of the persons charged. The petitioners
will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions. . .
We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual
homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted
person would come within the \[sex offender\] registration laws of a
least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction.
This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the
state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.
Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other
collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations
on job application forms, to mention but one example.

 

    ...

    The rationale of *Bowers* does not withstand careful analysis. In
his dissenting opinion in *Bowers*Justice Stevens came to these
conclusions:

"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact
that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a
particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding
a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save
a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack. Second,
individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of
their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce
offspring, are a form of "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause
of the [Fourteenth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv).
Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as
well as married persons." 478 U.S., at 216 (footnotes and citations
omitted). Justice Stevens' analysis, in our view, should have been
controlling in *Bowers* and should control here.

    *Bowers *was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct
today. It ought not to remain binding
precedent. *Bowers *v. *Hardwick* should be and now is overruled.

    The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve
persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in
relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not
involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the
government must give formal recognition to any relationship that
homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who,
with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual
practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled
to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their
existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual
conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause
gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without
intervention of the government. "It is a promise of the Constitution
that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not
enter." *Casey*, *supra*, at 847. The Texas statute furthers no
legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the
personal and private life of the individual.

    Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of
the [Fifth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv) or
the [Fourteenth
Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv) known
the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have
been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew
times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that
laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As
the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its
principles in their own search for greater freedom.

    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth
District is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 

**Excerpt of Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment**

 

The statute at issue here makes sodomy a crime only if a person "engages
in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex."
Tex. Penal Code Ann. §21.06(a) (2003). Sodomy between opposite-sex
partners, however, is not a crime in Texas. That is, Texas treats the
same conduct differently based solely on the participants. Those harmed
by this law are people who have a same-sex sexual orientation and thus
are more likely to engage in behavior prohibited by §21.06.

    The Texas statute makes homosexuals unequal in the eyes of the law
by making particular conduct--and only that conduct--subject to criminal
sanction. It appears that prosecutions under Texas' sodomy law are rare.
See *State* v. *Morales*, 869 S. W. 2d 941, 943 (Tex. 1994) (noting in
1994 that §21.06 "has not been, and in all probability will not be,
enforced against private consensual conduct between adults"). This case
shows, however, that prosecutions under §21.06 *do *occur. And while the
penalty imposed on petitioners in this case was relatively minor, the
consequences of conviction are not. As the Court notes, see *ante*, at
15, petitioners' convictions, if upheld, would disqualify them from or
restrict their ability to engage in a variety of professions, including
medicine, athletic training, and interior design. Indeed, were
petitioners to move to one of four States, their convictions would
require them to register as sex offenders to local law enforcement.

    And the effect of Texas' sodomy law is not just limited to the
threat of prosecution or consequence of conviction. Texas' sodomy law
brands all homosexuals as criminals, thereby making it more difficult
for homosexuals to be treated in the same manner as everyone else.
Indeed, Texas itself has previously acknowledged the collateral effects
of the law, stipulating in a prior challenge to this action that the law
"legally sanctions discrimination against \[homosexuals\] in a variety
of ways unrelated to the criminal law," including in the areas of
"employment, family issues, and housing." *State* v. *Morales*, 826
S. W. 2d 201, 203 (Tex. App. 1992). . .

 

** **

**Excerpt of Justice Scalia (joined by Justices Rehnquist and Thomas),
dissenting**

State laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest,
prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and
obscenity are likewise sustainable only in light of *Bowers*' validation
of laws based on moral choices. Every single one of these laws is called
into question by today's decision; the Court makes no effort to cabin
the scope of its decision to exclude them from its holding. See *ante*,
at 11 (noting "an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial
protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private
lives *in matters pertaining to sex*" (emphasis added)). The
impossibility of distinguishing homosexuality from other traditional
"morals" offenses is precisely why *Bowers* rejected the rational-basis
challenge. "The law," it said, "is constantly based on notions of
morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to
be invalidated under the Due Process Clause, the courts will be very
busy indeed." 478 U.S., at
196.[**^2^**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZD.html#FN2)

    What a massive disruption of the current social order, therefore,
the overruling of *Bowers* entails.

 

...

Whether homosexual sodomy was prohibited by a law targeted at same-sex
sexual relations or by a more general law prohibiting both homosexual
and heterosexual sodomy, the only relevant point is that
it *was* criminalized--which suffices to establish that homosexual
sodomy is not a right "deeply rooted in our Nation's history and
tradition." The Court today agrees that homosexual sodomy was
criminalized and thus does not dispute the facts on
which *Bowers* *actually* relied.

    Next the Court makes the claim, again unsupported by any citations,
that "\[l\]aws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced
against consenting adults acting in private." *Ante*, at 8. The key
qualifier here is "acting in private"--since the Court admits that
sodomy laws *were* enforced against consenting adults (although the
Court contends that prosecutions were "infrequent," *ante*, at 9). I do
not know what "acting in private" means; surely consensual sodomy, like
heterosexual intercourse, is rarely performed on stage. If all the Court
means by "acting in private" is "on private premises, with the doors
closed and windows covered," it is entirely unsurprising that evidence
of enforcement would be hard to come by. (Imagine the circumstances that
would enable a search warrant to be obtained for a residence on the
ground that there was probable cause to believe that consensual sodomy
was then and there occurring.) Surely that lack of evidence would not
sustain the proposition that consensual sodomy on private premises with
the doors closed and windows covered was regarded as a "fundamental
right," even though all other consensual sodomy was criminalized.

 

...

I turn now to the ground on which the Court squarely rests its holding:
the contention that there is no rational basis for the law here under
attack. This proposition is so out of accord with our
jurisprudence--indeed, with the jurisprudence of *any* society we
know--that it requires little discussion.

    The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the belief of its
citizens that certain forms of sexual behavior are "immoral and
unacceptable," *Bowers*, *supra*, at 196--the same interest furthered by
criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest,
bestiality, and obscenity. *Bowers* held that this *was* a legitimate
state interest. The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion. . .
This effectively decrees the end of all morals legislation. If, as the
Court asserts, the promotion of majoritarian sexual morality is not even
a *legitimate* state interest, none of the above-mentioned laws can
survive rational-basis review.

 

...

Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a
law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called
homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some
homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that
has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier
opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which
any reputable law school *must* seek to belong) excludes from membership
any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law
firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective
partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.
See *Romer*, *supra*, at 653.

    One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the
Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is
"an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in
the public and in the private spheres." *Ante*, at 14. It is clear from
this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from
its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of
engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly
engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as
scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's
schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting
themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be
immoral and destructive. . .

    Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any
other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means.
Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and
every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view
of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success
in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the
few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual
acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing
one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I
would no more *require *a State to criminalize homosexual acts--or, for
that matter, display *any* moral disapprobation of them--than I
would *forbid *it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within
the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be
stayed through the invention of a brand-new "constitutional right" by a
Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that
"later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper
in fact serve only to oppress," *ante*, at 18; and when that happens,
later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our
system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not
imposed by a governing caste that knows best.

    One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the
people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need
not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that
their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow
homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private
homosexual acts--and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends
that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that that we need not
fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently
occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has
chosen not to appeal). See *Halpern* v. *Toronto*, 2003 WL 34950
(Ontario Ct. App.); Cohen, Dozens in Canada Follow Gay Couple's Lead,
Washington Post, June 12, 2003, p. A25. At the end of its opinion--after
having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis
jurisprudence--the Court says that the present case "does not involve
whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship
that homosexual persons seek to enter." *Ante*, at 17. Do not believe
it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the
progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's
opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to
"personal decisions relating to *marriage*, procreation, contraception,
family relationships, child rearing, and education," and then declares
that "\[p\]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for
these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do." *Ante*, at 13
(emphasis added)*. *Today's opinion dismantles the structure of
constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between
heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in
marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is
"no legitimate state interest" for purposes of proscribing that
conduct, *ante*, at 18; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all
pretense of neutrality), "\[w\]hen sexuality finds overt expression in
intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element
in a personal bond that is more enduring," *ante*, at 6; what
justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of
marriage to homosexual couples exercising "\[t\]he liberty protected by
the Constitution," *ibid*.? Surely not the encouragement of procreation,
since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case "does
not involve" the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the
belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of
this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us,
this is so. . .

 

\*\*\*

**Backstory**

\[I\]n Lawrence v. Texas, cause lawyers saddled with unsympathetic
plaintiffs successfully made over their clients. Dale Carpenter has
uncovered the "real story" behind Lawrence. The two men lauded in an
opinion about "relationships" and "enduring personal bonds" were not a
couple, and perhaps not even sexually intimate at all. Instead, John
Lawrence and Tyron Garner were two "uncultured" low-income gay
men---Garner was virtually homeless and Lawrence had convictions for
'murder by automobile' and DWIs---embroiled in a drunken argument with
another friend. The Texas sodomy law was very rarely enforced and
convictions never appealed, as punishment was a relatively low fine.
Indeed, Lawrence and Garner were likely arrested because they were rude
to the officers at the scene, and advocates only learned of the unusual
case via a closeted gay court clerk who happened across the arrest
report. Given the rarity of arrests, LGB activists seized the
opportunity, warts and all. (Of course, one of the most significant
pitfalls of the case was that the men were not actually engaged in
sodomy, but the lawyers' control of the narrative prevented this fact
from being uncovered until after the Supreme Court case).

To maintain cover and reframe a "booze-soaked quarrel" as a "love
story," their lawyers silenced Lawrence and Garner. In stark contrast to
the Obergefell plaintiffs, they never appeared publicly without
"minders," and they were largely ignored by activists after the
decision. Sufficient funds could not even be raised for Garner's funeral
when he died destitute in 2006. One journalist articulated the
attorneys' fears when he asked why they kept their plaintiffs from the
press: "Do you have to be perfect to win in the Supreme Court? Y'all
didn't want \[their\] blemishes . . . out there?" By keeping the true
story of Lawrence and Garner hidden, lawyers gave the Court a tabula
rasa upon which to inscribe its vision of sex and
relationships---monogamous, committed, and private.

3.1

Criminal Law is Statutory Interpretation

 

(based on work by Sam Kamin)

 

Criminal law is about reading and applying statutes. Unlike your other
first year classes, criminal law is largely statutory in nature -- if
the legislature has not prohibited particular conduct, it is generally
not criminal. (With the caveat, of course, that in our word of plea
bargaining, prosecutors are the ones actually \"making\" law).

This has not always been the case. Traditionally, criminal law was what
*courts* said it was. The idea of \"common law crimes\" -- crimes
defined by court decisions rather than legislatures -- was widespread in
England for centuries. After American independence, many states formally
adopted English common law, including its definition of common law
crimes.

As time went on, however, states began to codify the definitions of
various crimes and nearly all abolished the idea that courts could
create new crimes. (e.g. the *Mochan* case you are reading today is no
longer good law\--was abrogated by the PA legislature). So reading the
statute carefully is a big part of what we will be learning this
semester. For example, many first year students are surprised to learn
that burglary is defined (loosely) as breaking and entering at night
with the intent to commit a felony inside. Thus, a person has completed
the crime of burglary when they have entered (what we'll call the actus
reus or act) intending to steal the owners\' possessions (what we'll
call the mens rea or guilty mind). TV and movies have accustomed us to
thinking of the burglar as the person in the ski mask leaving a house
with a sack full of stolen property. But looking, carefully, at the
statute prohibiting burglary shows us that he need not actually steal
anything in order to be guilty of burglary.

So what is the role of courts in this? The legislatures write the
statutes \-- the state's prohibition of specific conduct -- and judges
determine how to interpret and apply these statutes consistent with the
legislature's intent. Ultimately, however, the legislature is in charge
of the meaning of its statutes and if it disagrees with how the
judiciary has interpreted its statutes, it may override that reading by
making its true intent clear by amending laws and creating new ones.

Sometimes students are confused\--understandably because law school and
learning the law are very different than other educational
experiences\--and talk about the statute (or Model Penal Code\--the main
statute we look at in this course) and \"common law\" as two distinct
bodies of authority regulating people\'s conduct. But they are not
separate\--on an exam, or in real life, we always start with the statute
and then look at court decisions interpreting and applying that statute.
We will look at this symbiotic relationship by considering a burglary
statute and case in class.

In sum, it is largely presumed that unless the legislature has
prohibited the defendant's conduct, he cannot be convicted of a crime;
the courts will punish that conduct, and only that conduct, that the
legislature has chosen to prohibit. This is known as the **legality
principle**. Is this about notice/fairness to people, or about the roles
of the three branches of government, and a balance of powers? We will
discuss this more in class.

Commonwealth v. Mochan

 

Superior Court of Pennsylvania

177 Pa. Super. 454

Appeals, Nos. 151 and 152

1955-01-14

Hirt, J.,

One indictment **\[ ... \]**before us in the present appeals, charged
that the defendant on May 4, 1953 "devising, contriving and intending
the morals and manners of the good citizens of this Commonwealth **\[
... \]** to debauch and corrupt, and further devising and intending to
harass, embarrass and villify divers citizens of this Commonwealth, and
particularly one Louise Zivkovich and the members of the family **\[ ...
\]** unlawfully, wickedly and maliciously did **\[ ... \]**make numerous
telephone calls to *her* dwelling **\[ ... \]** at all times of the day
and night, in which **\[ ... \]**Michael Mochan did wickedly and
maliciously refer to *her*as a lewd, immoral and lascivious woman of an
indecent and lewd character, and other scurrilous approbrious, filthy,
disgusting and indecent language and talk and did then and there use in
said telephone calls **\[ ... \]**, not only with *her* but with other
members of the family **\[ ... \]** intending **\[ ... \]** to blacken
the character and reputation of the said Louise Zivkovich and to infer
that *she*was a woman of ill repute and ill fame, and intending **\[ ...
\]** to harass, embarrass and villify **\[ ... \]**to the great damage,
injury and oppression of the said Louise Zivkovich and other good
citizens of this Commonwealth to the evil example of all other in like
case offending, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania." **\[ ... \]**Defendant was **\[ ... \]** convicted **\[
... \]** and **\[ ... \]** has appealed **\[ ... \]**, on the ground
**\[ ... \]** that the conduct charged in the indictments, concededly
not a criminal offense in this State by any statute, does not constitute
a misdemeanor at common law. In a number of States and especially in the
common law State of Pennsylvania the common law of England, as to
crimes, is in force except in so far as it has been abrogated by
statute. **\[ ... \]**The indictments in these cases by their language,
clearly purported to charge a common law crime not included in our Penal
Code or elsewhere in our statutory law.

It is established by the testimony that the defendant over a period of
more than one month early in 1953**\[ ... \]**telephoned one Louise
Zivkovich, a stranger to him and a married woman of the highest
character and repute. **\[ ... \]**His language **\[ ... \]**was
obscene, lewd and filthy. He not only suggested intercourse with her but
talked of sodomy as well, in the loathsome language of that criminal
act, on a number of occasions. **\[ ... \]**Through cooperation with the
telephone company, the defendant was finally located and was arrested
**\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]**In *Commonwealth v. Miller,* 94 Pa. Superior Ct. 499, 507,
the controlling principles are thus stated: "The common law is
sufficiently broad to punish as a misdemeanor, although there may be no
exact precedent, any act which directly injures or tends to injure the
public to such an extent as to require the state to interfere and punish
the wrongdoer, as in the case of acts which injuriously affect public
morality, or obstruct, or pervert public justice, or the administration
of government: 16 Corpus Juris, Sec. 23, page 65**\[ ... \]**." Cf.
*Com. of Penna. v. DeGrange,* 97 Pa. Superior Ct. 181, in which it is
said: " 'Whatever openly outrages decency and is injurious to public
morals is a misdemeanor at common law': Russell on Crimes and
Misdemeanors, 8th Ed., Vol. 1, p. 10; 4 Blackstone's Commentaries 65,
note." Any act is indictable at common law which from its nature
scandalously affects the morals or health of the community. 1 Wharton
Criminal Law, 12 Ed., §23. Thus **\[ ... \]**in *Commonwealth v.
Glenny,* 54 D. & C. 633, **\[ ... \]** it was held that an indictment
charging that the defendant took indecent liberties tending to debauch
the morals of a male victim adequately set forth a common law offense.
And as early as *Updegraph v. Commonwealth,* 11 S. & R. 393, it was held
that Christianity is a part of the common law and maliciously to vilify
the Christian religion is an indictable offense.

The present defendant's criminal intent was evidenced by a number of
overt acts beyond the mere oral solicitation of adultery.**\[ ... \]**
Moreover potentially at least, defendant's acts injuriously affected
public morality. The operator or any one on defendant's four-party
telephone line could have listened in on the conversations, and at least
two other persons in Mrs. Zivkovich's household heard some of
defendant's immoral and obscene language over the telephone.

The name "Immoral Practices and Conduct" was ascribed to the offense and
was endorsed on the indictments by the District Attorney. Whether the
endorsement appropriately or adequately names the offense is unimportant
**\[ ... \]**; the factual charges in the body of the indictments
identify the offense as a common law misdemeanor and the testimony
established the guilt of the defendant.

**\[ ... \]**

Dissenting Opinion by

Woodside, J.

Not unmindful of the reprehensible conduct of the appellant, I
nevertheless cannot agree with the majority that what he did was a crime
punishable under the laws of this Commonwealth.

The majority is declaring something to be a crime which was never before
known to be a crime in this Commonwealth. They have done this by the
application of such general principles as "it is a crime to do anything
which injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent as to
require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer\';" and
"whatever openly outrages decency and is injurious to public morals is a
misdemeanor."

Not only have they declared it to be a crime to do an act "injuriously
affecting public morality," but they have declared it to be a crime to
do any act which has a "potentially" injurious effect on public
morality.

Under the division of powers in our constitution it is for the
legislature to determine what "injures or tends to injure the public."

One of the most important functions of a legislature is to determine
what acts "require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer."
There is no reason for the legislature to enact any criminal laws if the
courts delegate to themselves the power to apply such general principles
as are here applied to whatever conduct may seem to the courts to be
injurious to the public.

There is no doubt that the common law is a part of the law of this
Commonwealth, and we punish many acts under the common law. But after
nearly two hundred years of constitutional government in which the
legislature and not the courts have been charged by the people with the
responsibility of deciding which acts do and which do not injure the
public to the extent which requires punishment, it seems to me we are
making an unwarranted invasion of the legislative field when we arrogate
that responsibility to ourselves by declaring now, for the first time,
that certain acts are a crime.

When the legislature invades either the judicial or the executive
fields, or the executive invades either the judicial or legislative
fields, the courts stand ready to stop them. But in matters of this type
there is nothing to prevent our invasion of the legislative field except
our own self restraint. **\[ ... \]**

Questions on Mochan

 

1.  Notice the key decisions that were necessary in order for Michael
    Mochan to be convicted of a crime: first, the decision that "acts
    which injuriously affect public morality" are crimes; second, the
    decision that these phone calls constituted such injurious acts; and
    third, the decision that sufficient evidence exists to establish
    that Mochan was the person who made the calls. Which public
    officials made each of these decisions?

 

2.  Does it matter that the crime the majority finds Mochan guilty of is
    a misdemeanor (bringing no or less incarceration time than a
    felony)?

 

3.  Throughout this book, you can be confident that if a concurring or
    dissenting opinion is included in your assignment, there's something
    important to be learned from that opinion. In this case, Judge
    Woodside's dissenting opinion is important because his position is
    the majority view today:  criminalization decisions (the
    classifications of acts as crimes) should be made by the legislative
    branch rather than the judicial branch.  Why does Judge Woodside
    think that criminalization decisions should be made by a legislature
    rather than a court?

4.  The opinions in *Mochan* present two options: criminalization
    decisions can be made by the legislature, or criminalization
    decisions can be made by the judiciary. Are these the only two
    options?  In the United States, government is usually organized into
    three branches, not just two -- legislative, judicial, and
    executive.  Police and prosecutors are part of the executive
    branch.  Did executive branch officials play any role in the
    criminalization decision here?

No. 552

1931-03-09

Argued February 26, 27, 1931.

Mr. Justice Holmes

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner was convicted of transporting from Ottawa, Illinois, to
Guymon, Oklahoma, an airplane that he knew to have been stolen, and was
sentenced to serve three years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of
\$2,000. **\[ ... \]** A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on
the question whether the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act applies to
aircraft. Act of October 29, 1919**\[ ... \]**. That Act provides: "
Sec. 2. That when used in this Act: (a) The term 'motor vehicle' shall
include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motor cycle,
or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for .running on rails;
. . . Sec. 3. That whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in
interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle, knowing the same to have
been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than \$5,000, or by
imprisonment of not more than five years, or both."

**\[ ... \]**The question is the meaning of the word ' vehicle ' in the
phrase " any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on
rails." No doubt etymologically it is possible to use the word to
signify a conveyance working on land, water or air, and sometimes
legislation extends the use in that direction, e. g., land and air,
water being separately provided for, in the Tariff Act, September 22,
1922**\[ ... \]**. But in everyday speech ' vehicle ' calls up the
picture of a thing moving on land. **\[ ... \]**So here, the phrase
under discussion calls up the popular picture. For after including
automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words " any
other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails " still
indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running
on land, is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not
commonly called a vehicle, that flies. Airplanes were well known in
1919, when this statute was passed; but it is admitted that they were
not mentioned in the reports or in the debates in Congress. It is
impossible to read words that so carefully enumerate the different forms
of motor vehicles and have no reference of any kind to aircraft, as
including airplanes under a term that usage more and more precisely
confines to a different class. **\[ ... \]**

Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the
text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a
fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common
world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line
is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should
be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the
common mind only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the statute
should not be extended to aircraft, simply because it may seem to us
that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that, if the
legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been
used. **\[ ... \]**

Douglas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all Members
joined except Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., who took no part in the
consideration or decision of the case.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

This case involves eight defendants who were convicted in a Florida
municipal court of violating a Jacksonville, Florida, vagrancy
ordinance.[^1]**\[ ... \]**

The facts are stipulated. Papachristou and Calloway are white females.
Melton and Johnson are black males. Papachristou was enrolled in a
job-training program sponsored by the State Employment Service at
Florida Junior College in Jacksonville. Calloway was a typing and
shorthand teacher at a state mental institution located near
Jacksonville. She was the owner of the automobile in which the four
defendants were arrested. Melton was a Vietnam war veteran who had been
released from the Navy after nine months in a veterans' hospital. On the
date of his arrest he was a part-time computer helper while attending
college as a full-time student in Jacksonville. Johnson was a tow-motor
operator in a grocery chain warehouse and was a lifelong resident of
Jacksonville.

At the time of their arrest the four of them were riding in Calloway's
car on the main thoroughfare in Jacksonville. They had left a restaurant
owned by Johnson's uncle where they had eaten and were on their way to a
nightclub. The arresting officers denied that the racial mixture in the
car played any part in the decision to make the arrest. The arrest, they
said, was made because the defendants had stopped near a used-car lot
which had been broken into several times. There was, however, no
evidence of any breaking and entering on the night in question.

**\[ ... \]**

Brown was arrested when he was observed leaving a downtown Jacksonville
hotel by a police officer seated in a cruiser. The police testified he
was reputed to be a thief, narcotics pusher, and generally opprobrious
character. The officer called Brown over to the car, intending at that
time to arrest him unless he had a good explanation for being on the
street. Brown walked over to the police cruiser, as commanded, and the
officer began to search him, apparently preparatory to placing him in
the car. In the process of the search he came on two small packets which
were later found to contain heroin. When the officer touched the pocket
where the packets were, Brown began to resist. He was charged with
"disorderly loitering on street" and "disorderly conduct --- resisting
arrest with violence." While he was also charged with a narcotics
violation, that charge was *nolled.*

Jacksonville's ordinance and Florida's statute were "derived from early
English law," **\[ ... \]**, and employ "archaic language" in their
definitions of vagrants. *Id.,* at 855. **\[ ... \]** Later vagrancy
laws became criminal aspects of the poor laws. **\[ ... \]**

This ordinance is void for vagueness, both in the sense that it "fails
to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his
contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute," **\[ ... \]** and
because it encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions.
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The Jacksonville ordinance makes criminal activities which by modern
standards are normally innocent. "Nightwalking" is one. Florida
construes the ordinance not to make criminal one night's wandering, **\[
... \]**5, only the "habitual" wanderer or, as the ordinance describes
it, "common night walkers." We know, however, from experience that
sleepless people often walk at night, perhaps hopeful that
sleep-inducing relaxation will result.

**\[ ... \]**

"\[Pjersons able to work but habitually living upon the earnings of
their wives or minor children" --- like habitually living "without
visible means of support" --- might implicate unemployed pillars of the
community who have married rich wives.

"\[P\]ersons able to work but habitually living upon the earnings of
their wives or minor children" may also embrace unemployed people out of
the labor market, by reason of a recession [^2] or disemployed by reason
of technological or so-called structural displacements.

Persons "wandering or strolling" from place to place have been extolled
by Walt Whitman **\[ ... \]**The qualification "without any lawful
purpose or object" may be a trap for innocent acts. Persons "neglecting
all lawful business and habitually spending their time by frequenting .
. . places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served" would literally
embrace many members of golf clubs and city clubs.

**\[ ... \]**

These unwritten amenities have been in part responsible for giving our
people the feeling of independence and self-confidence, the feeling of
creativity. These amenities have dignified the right of dissent and have
honored the right to be nonconformists and the right to defy
submissiveness. They have encouraged lives of high spirits rather than
hushed, suffocating silence.

**\[ ... \]**

Where the list of crimes is so all-inclusive and generalized [^3] as the
one in this ordinance, those convicted may be punished for no more than
vindicating affronts to police authority:

> **\[ ... \]**

A direction by a legislature to the police to arrest all "suspicious"
persons[^4] would not pass constitutional muster. A vagrancy prosecution
may be merely the cloak for a conviction which could not be obtained on
the real but undisclosed grounds for the arrest.**\[ ... \]**

Those generally implicated by the imprecise terms of the ordinance ---
poor people, nonconformists, dissenters, idlers --- may be required to
comport themselves according to the lifestyle deemed appropriate by the
Jacksonville police and the courts. Where, as here, there are no
standards governing the exercise of the discretion granted by the
ordinance, the scheme permits and encourages an arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement of the law. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Of course, vagrancy statutes are useful to the police. Of
course, they are nets making easy the roundup of so-called undesirables.
But the rule of law implies equality and justice in its application.
Vagrancy laws of the Jacksonville type teach that the scales of justice
are so tipped that even-handed administration of the law is not
possible. The rule of law, evenly applied to minorities as well as
majorities, to the poor as well as the rich, is the great mucilage that
holds society together. •

The Jacksonville ordinance cannot be squared with our constitutional
standards and is plainly unconstitutional.

*Reversed.*

Chicago v. Morales

 

Supreme Court of the United States

527 U.S. 41, 119 S. Ct. 1849, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4005,
SCDB 1998-069

No. 97-1121

1999-06-10

Argued December 9, 1998

Justice Stevens

announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the
Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V, and an opinion with respect to
Parts III, IV, and VI, in which Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg
join.

In 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation
Ordinance, which prohibits "criminal street gang members" from
"loitering" with one another or with other persons in any public place.
The question presented is whether the Supreme Court of Illinois
correctly held that the ordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

I

Before the ordinance was adopted, the city council's Committee on Police
and Fire conducted hearings to explore the problems created by the
city's street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of public
loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the
neighborhoods where gang members are most active, as well as some of the
aldermen who represent those areas. Based on that evidence, the council
made a series of findings that are included in the text of the ordinance
and explain the reasons for its enactment.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xaad5e9d720c8ded36ac16cdce918597cda704e0)

The council found that a continuing increase in criminal street gang
activity was largely responsible for the city's rising murder rate, as
well as an escalation of violent and drug related crimes.**\[ ...
\]**Furthermore, the council stated that gang members "'establish
control over identifiable areas \... by loitering in those areas and
intimidating others from entering those areas; and . . . \[m\]embers of
criminal street gangs avoid arrest by committing no offense punishable
under existing laws when they know the police are present \....'" **\[
... \]**

The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to
\$500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and a requirement to
perform up to 120 hours of community service. Commission of the offense
involves four predicates. First, the police officer must reasonably
believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a
"'public place'" is a '"criminal street gang membe\[r\].'" Second, the
persons must be "'loitering,'" which the ordinance defines as "
'remaining\] in any one place with no apparent purpose.'" Third, the
officer must then order "'all'" of the persons to disperse and remove
themselves "'from the area.'" Fourth, a person must disobey the
officer's order. If any person, whether a gang member or not, disobeys
the officer's order, that person is guilty of violating the
ordinance.**\[ ... \]**[^5]

II

During the three years of its enforcement,[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xfa35e245163e69d02023587f60e01775a7082e8)the police issued over
89,000 dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000 people for violating
the ordinance.[^6] **\[ ... \]**

The Illinois Supreme Court **\[ ... \]**held "that the gang loitering
ordinance violates due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague
on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties." **\[
... \]**

We granted certiorari,**\[ ... \]** and now affirm. Like the Illinois
Supreme Court, we conclude that the ordinance enacted by the city of
Chicago is unconstitutionally vague.

Ill

The basic factual predicate for the city's ordinance is not in dispute.
As the city argues in its brief, "the very presence of a large
collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and
hangers-on on the public ways intimidates residents, who become afraid
even to leave their homes and go about their business. That, in turn,
imperils community residents' sense of safety and security, detracts
from property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire
neighborhoods."[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe5daf4a612811c765236c89b1c81d44a52d3561) We have no doubt that a
law that directly prohibited such intimidating conduct would be
constitutional,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6aa25bef7340bc8e260383cb7b0f7cd41743124)but this ordinance
broadly covers a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertainty
about the scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for
respondents' claim that the ordinance is too vague.

**\[ ... \]**

Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent
reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will
enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second,
it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement. **\[ ... \]**

IV

"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due
Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the
public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits .. . ." *Giaccio* v.
*Pennsylvania,* 382 U. S. 399, 402-403 (1966). The Illinois Supreme
Court recognized that the term "loiter" may have a common and accepted
meaning, **\[ ... \]**, but the definition of that term in this
ordinance --- "to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose" ---
does not. It is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of
Chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would know if
he or she had an "apparent purpose." If she were talking to another
person, would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently
checking her watch and looking expectantly down the street, would she
have an apparent purpose?[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xde91c1afaaa16507fb1d85f6998506d2d338612)

Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each
instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness
that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the
normal meaning of "loitering," but rather about what loitering is
covered by the ordinance and what is not. **\[ ... \]**

The city's principal response to this concern about adequate notice is
that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after they have failed
to comply with an officer's order to disperse. "\[Wjhatever problem is
created by a law that criminalizes conduct people normally believe to be
innocent is solved when persons receive actual notice from a police
order of what they are expected to do."[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xfb3a3046201141e2628a44a37d94e6d6b8cc93b)We find this response
unpersuasive for at least two reasons.

First, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the
ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law. "No one may
be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the
meaning of penal statutes." *Lanzetta* v. *New Jersey,* 306 U. S. 451,
453 (1939). Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to
criminal sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the
loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to
prohibit.[**\[ ... \]**](#X131fcac921b9bf09c506c7ccbcaa4d053204790) If
the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal order
itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. If the police are able
to decide arbitrarily which members of the public they will order to
disperse, then the Chicago ordinance becomes indistinguishable from the
law we held invalid in *Shuttlesworth* v. *Birmingham,* 382 U. S. 87, 90
(1965).[^7] Because an officer may issue an order only after prohibited
conduct has already occurred, *such* an order cannot retroactively give
adequate warning of the boundary between the permissible and the
impermissible applications of the law.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xdcb9c0c2d6ef612cc82dd1629fd98a2f920aaee)

Second, the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the
notice afforded by the ordinance. It provides that the officer "shall
order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area."
**\[ ... \]** This vague phrasing raises a host of questions. After such
an order issues, how long must the loiterers remain apart? How far must
they move? If each loiterer walks around the block and they meet again
at the same location, are they subject to arrest or merely to being
ordered to disperse again? **\[ ... \]**

Lack of clarity in the description of the loiterer\'s duty to obey a
dispersal order might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague
if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear, but it does
buttress our conclusion that the entire ordinance fails to give the
ordinary citizen adequate notiee of what is forbidden and what is
permitted. The Constitution does not permit a legislature to "set a net
large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts
to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should
be set at large." *United States* v. *Reese,* 92 U. S. 214, 221 (1876).
This ordinance is therefore vague "not in the sense that it requires a
person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible
normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct
is specified at all." *Coates* v. *Cincinnati,* 402 U. S. 611, 614
(1971).

V

The broad sweep of the ordinance also violates " The requirement that a
legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.' "
*Kolender* v. *Lawson,* 461 U. S., at 358. There are no such guidelines
in the ordinance. In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons
who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to
disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatory language in the
enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any
inquiry about their possible purposes. It matters not whether the reason
that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near
Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of
Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is
not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may--- indeed, she "shall"
--- order them to disperse.

Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of
innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its language to determine if it
"necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the
policeman on his beat." *Kolender* v. *Lawson,* 461 U. S., at 360*. The*
principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this
ease is the definition of loitering as "to remain in any one place with
no apparent purpose."

As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it "provides
absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities
constitute loitering." **\[ ... \]**We have no authority to construe the
language of a state statute more narrowly than the construction given by
that State's highest court.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xc282f2e354fb6021b9c9922c3dfa664ebe02f89)

Nevertheless, the city disputes the Illinois Supreme Court's
interpretation, arguing that the text of the ordinance limits the
officer's discretion*. The*

requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of
loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to
order dispersal. That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the
ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful
purpose or effect,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X87b799e5577cdd204f97acd46b013600e958431) or possibly if it only
applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang
members. But this ordinance**\[ ... \]** applies to everyone in the city
who **\[ ... \]**might unwittingly engage in forbidden loitering if they
happen to engage in idle conversation with a gang member.

Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance **\[
... \]** has the perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage
much of the intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the
city council's findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is
motivated either by an apparent purpose to publicize the gang's
dominance of certain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by
an equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in illegal
drugs. **\[ ... \]**The relative importance of its application to
harmless loitering is magnified by its inapplicability to loitering that
has an obviously threatening or illicit purpose.

**\[ ... \]**

IV

**\[ ... \]**We recognize the serious and difficult problems testified
to by the citizens of Chicago that led to the enactment of this
ordinance. "We are mindful that the preservation of liberty depends in
part on the maintenance of social order." *Houston* v. *Hill,* 482 U. S.
451, 471-472 (1987). However, in this instance the city has enacted an
ordinance that affords too much discretion to the police and too little
notice to citizens who wish to use the public streets.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is

*Affirmed.*

Justice Thomas,

with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The duly elected members of the Chicago City Council enacted the
ordinance at issue as part of a larger effort to prevent gangs from
establishing dominion over the public streets. By invalidating Chicago's
ordinance, I fear that the Court has unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding
citizens to lives of terror and misery. **\[ ... \]**

In many of our Nation's cities, gangs have "\[v\]ir**\[ ... \]**tually
overtaken\] certain neighborhoods, contributing to the economic and
social decline of these areas and causing fear and lifestyle changes
among law-abiding residents." U. S. Dept, of Justice, Office of Justice
Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Monograph: Urban Street Gang
Enforcement 3 (1997). Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our poorest
and most vulnerable citizens with a terror that the Court does not give
sufficient consideration, often relegating them to the status of
prisoners in their own homes. See U. S. Dept, of Justice, Attorney
General's Report to the President, Coordinated Approach to the Challenge
of Gang Violence: A Progress Report 1 (Apr. 1996) ("From the small
business owner who is literally crippled because he refuses to pay
'protection' money to the neighborhood gang, to the families who are
hostages within their homes, living in neighborhoods ruled by predatory
drug trafficking gangs, the harmful impact of gang violence \... is both
physically and psychologically debilitating").

The city of Chicago has suffered the devastation wrought by this
national tragedy. Last year, in an effort to curb plummeting attendance,
the Chicago Public Schools hired dozens of adults to escort children to
school. The youngsters had become too terrified of gang violence to
leave their homes alone. **\[ ... \]**

Before enacting its ordinance, the Chicago City Council held extensive
hearings on the problems of gang loitering. Concerned citizens appeared
to testify poignantly as to how gangs disrupt their daily lives. **\[
... \]**

Following these hearings, the council found that "criminal street gangs
establish control over identifiable areas \... by loitering in those
areas and intimidating others from entering those areas." **\[ ...
\]**It further found that the mere presence of gang members
"intimidatefe\] many law abiding citizens" and "creates a justifiable
fear for the safety of persons and property in the area." **\[ ... \]**
It is the product of this democratic process --- the council's attempt
to address these social ills --- that we are asked to pass judgment upon
today.

**\[ ... \]**

At the outset, it is important to note that the ordinance does not
criminalize loitering *per se.* Rather, it penalizes loiterers' failure
to obey a police officer's order to move along. **\[ ... \]**Far from
according officers too much discretion, the ordinance merely enables
police officers to fulfill one of their traditional functions. Police
officers are not, and have never been, simply enforcers of the criminal
law. They wear other hats --- importantly, they have long been vested
with the responsibility for preserving the public peace. **\[ ... \]**In
most American jurisdictions, police officers continue to be obligated,
by law, to maintain the public peace.[^8]

In their role as peace officers, the police long have had the authority
and the duty to order groups of individuals who threaten the public
peace to disperse. **\[ ... \]**

The authority to issue dispersal orders continues to play a commonplace
and crucial role in police operations, particularly in urban areas.[^9]
Even the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice recognize that "\[i\]n
day-to-day police experience there are innumerable situations in which
police are called upon to order people not to block the sidewalk, not to
congregate in a given place, and not to 'loiter' \.... The police may
suspect the loiterer of considering engaging in some form of undesirable
conduct that can be at least temporarily frustrated by ordering him or
her to 'move on.'" Standard 1 --- 8.4(d), p. 1.88, and comments (2d ed.
1980, Supp. 1986).[^10]

In order to perform them peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily,
the police inevitably must exercise discretion. **\[ ... \]**That is not
to say that the law should not provide objective guidelines for the
police, but simply that it cannot rigidly constrain their every action.
By directing a police officer not to issue a dispersal order unless he
"observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street
gang member loitering in any public place," **\[ ... \]** Chicago's
ordinance strikes an appropriate balance between those two extremes.
Just as we trust officers to rely on their experience and expertise in
order to make spur-of-the-moment determinations about amorphous legal
standards such as "probable cause" and "reasonable suspicion," so we
must trust them to determine whether a group of loiterers contains
individuals (in this case members of criminal street gangs) whom the
city has determined threaten the public peace. **\[ ... \]** In sum, the
Court's conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vague because it
" 'necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of
the policeman on his beat,' " *ante,* at 60, cannot be reconciled with
common sense, longstanding police practice, or this Court's Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence.

**\[ ... \]**

In concluding that the ordinance adequately channels police discretion,
I do not suggest that a police officer enforcing the Gang Congregation
Ordinance will never make a mistake. Nor do I overlook the *possibility*
that a police officer, acting in bad faith, might enforce the ordinance
in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. **\[ ... \]** Instances of
arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance, like any other
law, are best addressed when (and if) they arise, rather than
prophylactically **\[ ... \]**.

The plurality's conclusion that the ordinance "fails to give the
ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is
permitted," **\[ ... \]**is similarly untenable. There is nothing
"vague" about an order to disperse.[^11] *The*vast majority of people
who are ordered by the police to "disperse and remove themselves from
the area" will have little difficulty understanding how to comply. **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**"If any fool would know that a particular category of
conduct would be within the reach of the statute, if there is an
unmistakable core that a reasonable person would know is forbidden by
the law, the enactment is not unconstitutional on its face." *Kolender,*
461 U. S., at 370-371 (dissenting opinion). **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** It is also anomalous to characterize loitering as
"innocent" conduct when it has been disfavored throughout American
history. **\[ ... \]**The term "loiter" is no different from terms such
as "fraud," "bribery," and "perjury." We expect people of ordinary
intelligence to grasp the meaning of such legal terms despite the fact
that they are arguably imprecise.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe6e0fe1f41b3b34e7db7adfeb3314671a2ad5ca)

The plurality underestimates the intellectual capacity of the citizens
of Chicago. Persons of ordinary intelligence are perfectly capable of
evaluating how outsiders perceive their conduct, and here "\[i\]t is
self-evident that there is a whole range of conduct that anyone with at
least a semblance of common sense would know is \[loitering\] and that
would be covered by the statute." See *Smith* v. *Goguen,* 415 U. S.
566, 584 (1974) (White, J., concurring in judgment). Members of a group
standing on the corner staring blankly into space, for example, are
likely well aware that passersby would conclude that they have "no
apparent purpose." **\[ ... \]**

\* \* \*

Today, the Court focuses extensively on the "rights" of gang members and
their companions. It can safely do so--- the people who will have to
live with the consequences of today's opinion do not live in our
neighborhoods. Rather, the people who will suffer from our lofty
pronouncements are people **\[ ... \]** people who have seen their
neighborhoods literally destroyed by gangs and violence and drugs. They
are good, decent people who must struggle to overcome their desperate
situation, against all odds, in order to raise their families, earn a
living, and remain good citizens. As one resident described: "There is
only about maybe one or two percent of the people in the city causing
these problems maybe, but it's keeping 98 percent of us in our houses
and off the streets and afraid to shop." **\[ ... \]**By focusing
exclusively on the imagined "rights" of the two percent, the Court today
has denied our most vulnerable citizens the very thing that Justice
Stevens, **\[ ... \]**elevates above all else --- the " 'freedom of
movement.' " And that is a shame. I respectfully dissent.

4.  How much weight should the Court give to the fact that Officers were

Ewing v. California

 

The Ewing opinion (below) discusses the Polly Klaas kidnapping and
murder.

Here\'s a particularly poignant description of the sentencing argument
from Ewing\'s attorney and Ewing:

> Ewing\'s lawyer, Ms. Bristo, asked Judge Myers to treat his current
> offense as a misdemeanor or to strike one of the first two offenses on
> which the prosecution was relying. She argued that all of Ewing\'s

> for his drug problems. In addition to his drug addiction, Ewing was
> battling full blown AIDS. At the time of trial, complications from the
> disease had caused him to go blind in one eye (and he later began to
> lose vision in the other). Bristo portrayed Ewing as a terminally ill
> man who posed no threat of violence in the future.
>
> Ewing himself addressed the court, stating, \"I would just like to beg
> the mercy of the court asking that any sentence I be given be
> suspended and I\'m given a chance in a drug rehab to get my life
> together. I don\'t have very long and the little time I do have left
> to live I want to do something, make myself better.\" Several people,

**\[ ... \]**

Justice O'Connor

announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which
The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join.

In this case, we decide whether the**\[ ... \]** prohibits the State of
California from sentencing a repeat felon to a prison term of 25 years
to life under the State's "Three Strikes and You're Out" law.

**\[ ... \]**

On October 1, 1993, while *\[a voter initiative for what would later
become the three strikes law was circulating after the law was initially
defeated in the California Assembly\]*, 12-year-old Polly Klaas was
kidnapped from her home in Petaluma, California. Her admitted killer,
Richard Allen Davis, had a long criminal history that included two prior
kidnaping convictions. Davis had served only half of his most recent
sentence (16 years for kidnaping, assault, and burglary). Had Davis
served his entire sentence, he would still have been in prison on the
day that Polly Klaas was kidnaped.

Polly Klaas' murder galvanized support for the three strikes initiative.
Within days, Proposition 184 was on its way to becoming the fastest
qualifying initiative in California history. **\[ ... \]**California
voters approved Proposition 184 by a margin of 72 to 28 percent on
November 8, 1994.

California thus became the second State to enact a three strikes
law[^12]. **\[ ... \]**

Under California law, certain offenses may be classified as either
felonies or misdemeanors. These crimes are known as "wobblers." Some
crimes that would otherwise be misdemeanors become "wobblers" because of
the defendant's prior record. For example, petty theft, a misdemeanor,
becomes a "wobbler" when the defendant has previously served a prison
term for committing specified theft-related crimes. **\[ ... \]** Other
crimes, such as grand theft, are "wobblers" regardless of the
defendant's prior record.**\[ ... \]**Both types of "wobblers" are
triggering offenses under the three strikes law only when they are
treated as felonies. Under California law, a "wobbler" is presumptively
a felony and "remains a felony except when the discretion is actually
exercised" to make the crime a misdemeanor. **\[ ... \]**

In California, prosecutors may exercise their discretion to charge a
"wobbler" as either a felony or a misdemeanor. Likewise, California
trial courts have discretion to reduce a "wobbler" charged as a felony
to a misdemeanor either before preliminary examination or at sentencing
to avoid imposing a three strikes sentence. **\[ ... \]** In exercising
this discretion, the court may consider "those factors that direct
similar sentencing decisions," such as "the nature and circumstances of
the offense, the defendant's appreciation of and attitude toward the
offense,\... \[and\] the general objectives of sentencing."**\[ ... \]**

*\[T\]rial* courts may avoid imposing a three strikes sentence in two
ways: first, by reducing "wobblers" to misdemeanors (which do not
qualify as triggering offenses), and second, by vacating allegations of
prior "serious" or "violent" felony convictions.

C

On parole from a 9-year prison term, petitioner Gary Ewing walked into
the pro shop of the El Segundo Golf Course in Los Angeles County on
March 12, 2000. He walked out with three golf clubs, priced at \$399
apiece, concealed in his pants leg. A shop employee, whose suspicions
were aroused when he observed Ewing limp out of the pro shop, telephoned
the police. The police apprehended Ewing in the parking lot.

Ewing is no stranger to the criminal justice system. In 1984, at the age
of 22, he pleaded guilty to theft. The court sentenced him to six months
in jail (suspended), three years' probation, and a \$300 fine. In 1988,
he was convicted of felony grand theft auto and sentenced to one year in
jail and three years' probation. After Ewing completed probation,
however, the sentencing court reduced the crime to a misdemeanor,
permitted Ewing to withdraw his guilty plea, and dismissed the case. In
1990, he was convicted of petty theft with a prior and sentenced to 60
days in the county jail and three years' probation. In 1992, Ewing was
convicted of battery and sentenced to 30 days in the county jail and two
years' summary probation. One month later, he was convicted of theft and
sentenced to 10 days in the county jail and 12 months' probation. In
January 1993, Ewing was convicted of burglary and sentenced to 60 days
in the county jail and one year's summary probation. In February 1993,
he was convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia and sentenced to six
months in the county jail and three years' probation. In July 1993, he
was convicted of appropriating lost property and sentenced to 10 days in
the county jail and two years' summary probation. In September 1993, he
was convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm and trespassing and
sentenced to 30 days in the county jail and one year's probation.

In October and November 1993, Ewing committed three burglaries and one
robbery at a Long Beach, California, apartment complex over a 5-week
period. He awakened one of his victims, asleep on her living room sofa,
as he tried to disconnect her video cassette recorder from the
television in that room. When she screamed, Ewing ran out the front
door. On another occasion, Ewing accosted a victim in the mailroom of
the apartment complex. Ewing claimed to have a gun and ordered the
victim to hand over his wallet. When the victim resisted, Ewing produced
a knife and forced the victim back to the apartment itself. While Ewing
rifled through the bedroom, the victim fled the apartment screaming for
help. Ewing absconded with the victim's money and credit cards.

On December 9, 1993, Ewing was arrested on the premises of the apartment
complex for trespassing and lying to a police officer. The knife used in
the robbery and a glass cocaine pipe were later found in the back seat
of the patrol car used to transport Ewing to the police station. A jury
convicted Ewing of first-degree robbery and three counts of residential
burglary. Sentenced to nine years and eight months in prison, Ewing was
paroled in 1999.

Only 10 months later, Ewing stole the golf clubs at issue in this case.
He was charged with, and ultimately convicted of, one count of felony
grand theft of personal property in excess of \$400. **\[ ... \]**As
required by the three strikes law, the prosecutor formally alleged, and
the trial court later found, that Ewing had been convicted previously of
four serious or violent felonies for the three burglaries and the
robbery in the Long Beach apartment complex. **\[ ... \]**

At the sentencing hearing, Ewing asked the court to reduce the
conviction for grand theft, a "wobbler" under California law, to a
misdemeanor so as to avoid a three strikes sentence. **\[ ... \]**
Before sentencing Ewing, the trial court took note of his entire
criminal history, including the fact that he was on parole when he
committed his latest offense. The court also heard arguments from
defense counsel and a plea from Ewing himself.

In the end, the trial judge determined that the grand theft should
remain a felony. The court also ruled that the four prior strikes for
the three burglaries and the robbery in Long Beach should stand. As a
newly convicted felon with two or more "serious" or "violent" felony
convictions in his past, Ewing was sentenced under the three strikes law
to 25 years to life.

**\[ ... \]**We now affirm.

II

A

The Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments,
contains a "narrow proportionality principle" that "applies to
noncapital sentences." *Harmelin* v. *Michigan***\[ ... \]***.*

In *Rummel,* we held that it did not violate the Eighth Amendment for a
State to sentence a three-time offender to life in prison with the
possibility of parole. **\[ ... \]**Like Ewing, Rummel was sentenced to
a lengthy prison term under a recidivism statute. Rummel's two prior
offenses were a 1964 felony for "fraudulent use of a credit card to
obtain \$80 worth of goods or services," and a 1969 felony conviction
for "passing a forged check in the amount of \$28.36." **\[ ... \]** His
triggering offense was a conviction for felony theft --- "obtaining
\$120.75 by false pretenses." **\[ ... \]**

This Court ruled that "\[h\]aving twice imprisoned him for felonies,
Texas was entitled to place upon Rummel the onus of one who is simply
unable to bring his conduct within the social norms prescribed by the
criminal law of the State." **\[ ... \]**Although we stated that the
proportionality principle "would . . . come into play in the extreme
example \... if a legislature made overtime parking a felony punishable
by life imprisonment," **\[ ... \]**we held that "the mandatory life
sentence imposed upon this petitioner does not constitute cruel and
unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments," **\[ ...
\]**.

In *Hutto* v. *Davis,***\[ ... \]**the defendant was sentenced to two
consecutive terms of 20 years in prison for possession with intent to
distribute nine ounces of marijuana and distribution of marijuana. We
held that such a sentence was constitutional: "In short, *Rummel* stands
for the proposition that federal courts should be reluctant to review
legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment, and that successful
challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences should be
exceedingly rare." **\[ ... \]**

Three years after *Rummel,* in *Solem* v. *Helm*[^13]*,* **\[ ... \]**
we held that the Eighth Amendment prohibited "a life sentence without
possibility of parole for a seventh nonviolent felony." The triggering
offense in *Solem* was "uttering a 'no account' check for \$100." **\[
... \]**We specifically stated that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel
and unusual punishments "prohibits .. . sentences that are
disproportionate to the crime committed," and that the "constitutional
principle of proportionality has been recognized explicitly in this
Court for almost a century." **\[ ... \]** The *Solem* Court then
explained that three factors may be relevant to a determination of
whether a sentence is so disproportionate that it violates the Eighth
Amendment: "(i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the
penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same
jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same
crime in other jurisdictions." **\[ ... \]**

Applying these factors in *Solem,* we struck down the defendant's
sentence of life without parole. We specifically noted the contrast
between that sentence and the sentence in *Rummel,* pursuant to which
the defendant was eligible for parole. **\[ ... \]**

Eight years after *Solem,* we grappled with the proportionality issue
again in *Harmelin. Harmelin* was not a recidivism case, but rather
involved a first-time offender convicted of possessing 672 grams of
cocaine. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of
parole. A majority of the Court rejected Harmelin's claim that his
sentence was so grossly disproportionate that it violated the Eighth
Amendment. **\[ ... \]**

Justice Kennedy, joined by two other Members of the Court, concurred in
part and concurred in the judgment. Justice Kennedy specifically
recognized that "\[t\]he Eighth Amendment proportionality principle also
applies to noncapital sentences." **\[ ... \]** He then identified four
principles of proportionality review --- "the primacy of the
legislature, the variety of legitimate penological schemes, the nature
of our federal system, and the requirement that proportionality review
be guided by objective factors" --- that "inform the final one: The
Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime
and sentence. Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are
'grossly disproportionate' to the crime." **\[ ... \]**

The proportionality principles in our cases distilled in Justice
Kennedy's concurrence guide our application of the Eighth Amendment in
the new context that we are called upon to consider.

B

For many years, most States have had laws providing for enhanced
sentencing of repeat offenders. **\[ ... \]** Yet between 1993 and 1995,
three strikes laws effected a sea change in criminal sentencing
throughout the Nation.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xf56c6f18bb4015b096afc48ba0429e34bd2ad7f) These laws responded to
widespread public concerns about crime by targeting the class of
offenders who pose the greatest threat to public safety: career
criminals. As one of the chief architects of California's three strikes
law has explained: "Three Strikes was intended to go beyond simply
making sentences tougher. It was intended to be a focused effort to
create a sentencing policy that would use the judicial system to reduce
serious and violent crime." **\[ ... \]**

California's justification is no pretext. Recidivism is a serious public
safety concern in California and throughout the Nation. According to a
recent report, approximately 67 percent of former inmates released from
state prisons were charged with at least one "serious" new crime within
three years of their release. **\[ ... \]**

The State's interest in deterring crime also lends some support to the
three strikes law. We have long viewed both incapacitation and
deterrence as rationales for recidivism statutes: "\[A\] recidivist
statute\['s\] . . . primary goals are to deter repeat offenders and, at
some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses
serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from
the rest of society for an extended period of time." **\[ ... \]**

III

Against this backdrop, we consider Ewing's claim that his three strikes
sentence of 25 years to life is unconstitutionally disproportionate to
his offense of "shoplifting three golf clubs." **\[ ... \]**At the
threshold, we note that Ewing incorrectly frames the issue. The gravity
of his offense was not merely "shoplifting three golf clubs." Rather,
Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for- stealing nearly \$1,200
worth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at least
two "violent" or "serious" felonies. **\[ ... \]**

In weighing the gravity of Ewing's offense, we must place on the scales
not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony
recidivism. Any other approach would fail to accord proper deference to
the policy judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of
sanctions. In imposing a three strikes sentence, the State's interest is
not merely punishing the offense of conviction, or the "triggering"
offense: "\[I\]t is in addition the interest\... in dealing in a harsher
manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are
simply incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by
its criminal law." **\[ ... \]** To give full effect to the State's
choice of this legitimate penological goal, our proportionality review
of Ewing's sentence must take that goal into account.

Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in
incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons, and amply supported by
his own long, serious criminal record.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X1003e5e1d864290a00f9c6f348302e8ef0554c8)Ewing has been convicted
of numerous misdemeanor and felony offenses, served nine separate terms
of incarceration, and committed most of his crimes while on probation or
parole. His prior "strikes" were serious felonies including robbery and
three residential burglaries. To be sure, Ewing's sentence is a long
one. But it reflects a rational legislative judgment, entitled to
deference, that offenders who have committed serious or violent felonies
and who continue to commit felonies must be incapacitated. The State of
California "was entitled to place upon \[Ewing\] the onus of one who is
simply unable to bring his conduct within the social norms prescribed by
the criminal law of the State." **\[ ... \]** Ewing's is not "the rare
case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the
sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportion-ality."
**\[ ... \]**

We hold that Ewing's sentence of 25 years to life in prison, imposed for
the offense of felony grand theft under the three strikes law, is not
grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The judgment
of the California Court of Appeal is affirmed.

**\[ ... \]**

Justice Scalia,

concurring in the judgment.

**\[ ... \]**[^14]

Proportionality --- the notion that the punishment should fit the crime
--- is inherently a concept tied to the penological goal of retribution.
"\[I\]t becomes difficult even to speak intelligently of
'proportionality,' once deterrence and rehabilitation are given
significant weight," **\[ ... \]**not to mention giving weight to the
purpose of California's three strikes law: incapacitation. In the
present case, the game is up once the plurality has acknowledged that
"the Constitution does not mandate adoption of any one penological
theory," and that a "sentence can have a variety of justifications, such
as incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, or rehabilitation." **\[ ...
\]**That acknowledgment having been made, it no longer suffices merely
to assess "the gravity of the offense compared to the harshness of the
penalty," **\[ ... \]**; that classic description of the proportionality
principle (alone and in itself quite resistant to policy-free, legal
analysis) now becomes merely the "first" step of the inquiry**\[ ...
\]***.* Having completed that step (by a discussion which, in all
fairness, does not convincingly establish that 25-years-to-life is a
"proportionate" punishment for stealing three golf clubs), the plurality
must then *add* an analysis to show that "Ewing's sentence is justified
by the State's public-safety interest in incapacitating and deterring
recidivist felons."**\[ ... \]**

Which indeed it is --- though why that has anything to do with the
principle of proportionality is a mystery. Perhaps the plurality should
revise its terminology, so that what it reads into the Eighth Amendment
is not the unstated proposition that all punishment should be reasonably
proportionate to the gravity of the offense, but rather the unstated
proposition that all punishment should reasonably pursue the multiple
purposes of the criminal law. That formulation would make it clearer
than ever, of course, that the plurality is not applying law but
evaluating policy.

Because I agree that petitioner's sentence does not violate the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, I concur
in the judgment.

OPINION OF THE COURT

\[560 U.S. 52\]

Justice Kennedy

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The issue before the Court is whether the Constitution permits a
juvenile offender to be sentenced to life in prison

**\[ ... \]**

without parole for a nonhomicide crime. The sentence was imposed by the
State of Florida. Petitioner challenges the sentence under the Eighth
Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the
States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. **\[ ...
\]**

I

Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham. He was born on January 6, 1987.
Graham's parents were addicted to crack cocaine, and their drug use
persisted in his early years. Graham was diagnosed with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder in elementary school. He began drinking
alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked marijuana at age 13.

In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three other school-age
youths attempted to rob a barbeque restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida.
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Under Florida law, it is within a prosecutor's discretion
whether to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for most
felony crimes. Fla. Stat. § 985.227(1)(b) (2003) (subsequently
renumbered at § 985.557(1)(b) (2007)). Graham's prosecutor elected to
charge Graham as an adult. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both charges under a plea
agreement. **\[ ... \]**

The court withheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and
sentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of probation. Graham was
required to spend the first 12 months of his probation in the county
jail, but he received credit for the time he had served awaiting trial,
and was released on June 25, 2004.

Less than six months later, on the night of December 2, 2004, Graham
again was arrested. The State's case was as follows: Earlier that
evening, Graham participated in a home invasion robbery. His two
accomplices were Meigo Bailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old
men. According to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham, Bailey, and
Lawrence knocked on the door of the home where Carlos Rodriguez lived.
Graham, followed by Bailey and Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and
held a pistol to Rodriguez's chest. For the next 30 minutes, the three
held Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at gunpoint while
they ransacked the home searching for money. Before leaving, Graham and
his accomplices barricaded Rodriguez and his friend inside a closet.

The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and Lawrence, later the
same evening, attempted a second robbery, during which Bailey was shot.
**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied involvement in the crimes.
**\[ ... \]**The night that Graham allegedly committed the robbery, he
was 34 days short of his 18th birthday.

**\[ ... \]**

Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the home invasion
robbery; but, even after the court underscored that the admission could
expose him to a life sentence on the earlier charges, he admitted
violating probation conditions by fleeing. The State presented evidence
related to the home invasion, including testimony from the victims. **\[
... \]**The court further found that Graham had violated his probation
by committing a home invasion robbery, by possessing a firearm, and by
associating with persons engaged in criminal activity.

The trial court held a sentencing hearing. Under Florida law the minimum
sentence Graham could receive absent a

**\[ ... \]**

downward departure by the judge was 5 years' imprisonment. The maximum
was life imprisonment. Graham's attorney requested the minimum
nondeparture sentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the
Florida Department of Corrections recommended that Graham receive an
even lower sentence---at most 4 years' imprisonment. The State
recommended that Graham receive 30 years on the armed burglary count and
15 years on the attempted armed robbery count.

**\[ ... \]**

> **\[ ... \]**

The trial court **\[ ... \]** sentenced him to the maximum sentence
authorized by law on each charge: life imprisonment for the armed
burglary and 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. Because Florida
has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat. § 921.002(1)(e) (2003),
a life sentence gives a defendant no possibility of release unless he is
granted executive clemency

**\[ ... \]**

II

The Eighth Amendment states: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."
To determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, courts must look
beyond historical conceptions to " 'the evolving standards of decency
that mark the progress of a maturing society.' " **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The Court's cases addressing the proportionality of sentences fall
within two general classifications. The first involves challenges to the
length of term-of-years sentences given all the circumstances in a
particular case. The second comprises cases in which the Court
implements the proportionality standard by certain categorical
restrictions on the death penalty.

**\[ ... \]**

The second classification of cases has used categorical rules to define
Eighth Amendment standards. The previous cases in this classification
involved the death penalty. The classification in turn consists of two
subsets, one considering the nature of the offense, the other
considering the characteristics of the offender. **\[ ... \]**

In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has taken the
following approach. The Court first considers "objective indicia of
society's standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state
practice" to determine whether there is a national consensus against the
sentencing practice at issue. *Roper, supra,* at 563, 125 S. Ct. 1183,
161 L. Ed. 2d 1. Next, guided by "the standards elaborated by
controlling precedents and by the Court's own understanding and
interpretation of the Eighth Amendment's text, history, meaning, and
purpose," *Kennedy,* 554 U.S., at 421, 128 S. Ct. 2641, 171 L. Ed. 2d
525, the Court must determine in the exercise of its own independent
judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution.
*Roper, supra,* at 564, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1.

The present case involves an issue the Court has not considered
previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of-years sentence. The
approach in cases such as *Harmelin* and *Ewing* is suited for
considering a gross proportionality challenge to a particular
defendant's sentence, but here a sentencing practice itself is in
question. This case implicates a particular type of sentence as it
applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of
crimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the severity of the
penalty and the gravity of the crime does not advance the analysis.
Here, in addressing the question presented, the appropriate analysis is
the one used in cases that involved

**\[ ... \]**

the categorical approach, specifically *Atkins, Roper,* and *Kennedy.*

Ill

A

The analysis begins with objective indicia of national consensus. **\[
... \]**

Here, an examination of actual sentencing practices in jurisdictions
where the sentence in question is permitted by statute discloses a
consensus against its use. Although these statutory schemes contain no
explicit prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile
nonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infrequent. According to
a recent study, nationwide there are only 109 juvenile offenders serving
sentences of life without

**\[ ... \]**

parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, & C. Rice,
Juvenile Life without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared
to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to those we have been
able to locate independently, there are 123 juvenile nonhomicide
offenders serving life without parole sentences. A significant majority
of those, 77 in total, are serving sentences imposed in Florida. **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

*Roper* established that because juveniles have lessened culpability
they are less deserving of the most severe punishments. 543 U.S., at
569, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1. As compared to adults, juveniles
have a " 'lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of
responsibility' "; they "are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative
influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure"; and their
characters are "not as well formed." *Id.,* at 569-570, 125 S. Ct. 1183,
161 L. Ed. 2d 1. These salient characteristics mean that " \[i\] t is
difficult even for expert psychologists to differentiate between the
juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient
immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects
irreparable corruption." *Id.,* at 573, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed.
2d 1. Accordingly, "juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be
classified among the worst offenders." *Id.,* at 569, 125 S. Ct. 1183,
161 L. Ed. 2d 1. Ajuvenile is not absolved of responsibility for his
actions, but his transgression "is not as morally reprehensible as that
of an adult." *Thompson, supra,* at 835, 108 S. Ct. 2687, 101 L. Ed. 2d
702 (plurality opinion).

No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court's observations in
*Roper* about the nature of juveniles. As petitioner's *amici* point
out, developments in psychology and brain science continue to show
fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds. For example,
parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature
through late adolescence. See Brief for American Medical Association et
al. 16-24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. 22-27.
Juveniles are more capable of change than are adults, and their actions
are less likely to be evidence of "irretrievably depraved character"
than are the actions of adults. *Roper,* 543 U.S., at 570, 125 S. Ct.
1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1. **\[ ... \]**

.

**\[ ... \]**

It follows that, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender
who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral
culpability. The age of the offender and the nature of the crime each
bear on the analysis.

As for the punishment, life without parole is "the second most severe
penalty permitted by law." **\[ ... \]**

Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile.
Under this sentence a juvenile offender will on average serve more years
and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender. A
16-year-old and a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole
receive the same punishment in name only. **\[ ... \]**

The penological justifications for the sentencing practice are also
relevant to the analysis. **\[ ... \]**A sentence lacking any legitimate
penological justification is by its nature disproportionate to the
offense. With respect to life without parole for juvenile non-homicide
offenders, none of the goals of penal sanctions that have been
recognized as legitimate---retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and
rehabilitation, see *Ewing,* 538 U.S., at 25, 123 S. Ct. 1179, 155 L.
Ed. 2d 108 (plurality opinion)---provides an adequate justification.

Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it cannot support the
sentence at issue here. Society is entitled to impose severe sanctions
on a juvenile nonhomicide offender to express its condemnation of the
crime and to seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the
offense. **\[ ... \]**as *Roper* observed, "\[w\]hether viewed as an
attempt to express the community's moral outrage or as an attempt to
right the balance for the wrong to the victim, the case for retribution
is not as strong with a minor as with an adult." 543 U.S., at 571, 125
S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1. **\[ ... \]**

Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence either. *Roper*
noted that "the same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable
than adults suggest. . . that juveniles will be less susceptible to
deterrence." *Ibid.* Because juveniles' "lack of maturity and an
underdeveloped sense of responsibility . . . often result in impetuous
and ill-considered actions and decisions," *Johnson* v. *Texas,* 509
U.S. 350, 367, 113 S. Ct. 2658, 125 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1993), they are less
likely to take a possible punishment into consideration when making
decisions. This is particularly so when that punishment is rarely
imposed. **\[ ... \]**

Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprisonment, does not
justify the life without parole sentence in question here. **\[ ...
\]**But while incapacitation may be a legitimate penological goal
sufficient to justify life without parole in other contexts, it is
inadequate to justify that punishment for juveniles who did not commit
homicide. To justify life without parole on the assumption that the
juvenile offender forever will be a danger to society requires the
sentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorrigible. The
characteristics of juveniles make that

**\[ ... \]**

judgment questionable. **\[ ... \]**

A life without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile offender a
chance to demonstrate growth and maturity. Incapacitation cannot
override all other considerations, lest the Eighth Amendment's rule
against disproportionate sentences be a nullity.

**\[ ... \]**

A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, however, cannot be
justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The penalty forswears
altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By denying the defendant the right
to reenter the community, the State makes an irrevocable judgment about
that person's value and place in society. **\[ ... \]**

This determination; the limited culpability of juvenile nonhomicide
offenders; and the severity of life without parole sentences all lead to
the conclusion that the sentencing practice under consideration is cruel
and unusual. This Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did
not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of life
without parole. This clear line is necessary to prevent the possibility
that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile
nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that
punishment. Because "\[t\]he age of 18 is the point where society draws
the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood," those who
were below that age when the offense was committed may not be sentenced
to

**\[ ... \]**

life without parole for a nonhomicide crime. *Roper,* 543 U.S., at 574,
125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1.

A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile
offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime. What the State must do,
however, is give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to
obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. **\[
... \]** The Eighth Amendment does not foreclose the possibility that
persons convicted of nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will
remain behind bars for life. It does prohibit States from making the
judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter
society.

C

Categorical rules tend to be imperfect, but one is necessary here. **\[
... \]**

The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however, be confined by
some boundaries. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide offenders a
chance to demonstrate maturity and reform. The juvenile should not be
deprived of the opportunity to achieve maturity of judgment and
self-recognition of human worth and potential. **\[ ... \]**

Terrance Graham's sentence guarantees he will die in prison without any
meaningful opportunity to obtain release, no matter what he might do to
demonstrate that the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not
representative of his true character, even if he spends the next half
century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from his mistakes.
The State has denied him any chance to later demonstrate that he is fit
to rejoin society based solely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed
while he was a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth Amendment
does not permit.

**\[ ... \]**

The Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life without parole
sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide. A State
need not guarantee the offender eventual release, but if it imposes a
sentence of life it must provide him or her with some realistic
opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term. The judgment
of the First District Court of Appeal of Florida is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Chief Justice Roberts,

concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court that Terrance Graham's sentence of life without
parole violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on "cruel and unusual
punishments." Unlike the majority, however, I see no need to invent a
new constitutional rule of dubious provenance in reaching that
conclusion. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The Court defends its categorical approach on the grounds that a "clear
line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole
sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not
sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment." *Ante,* at 74, 176 L.
Ed. 2d, at 845. It argues that a case-by-case approach to
proportionality review is constitutionally insufficient because courts
might not be able "with sufficient accuracy \[to\] distinguish the few
incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for
change." *Ante,* at 77, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 847.

The Court is of course correct that judges will never have perfect
foresight---or perfect wisdom---in making sentencing decisions. But this
is true when they sentence adults no less than when they sentence
juveniles. It is also true when they sentence juveniles who commit
murder no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit other
crimes.

**\[ ... \]**

![](media/rId57.png){width="3.5104166666666665in" height="0.4375in"}

Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which he deserves
serious punishment. But he was only 16 years old, and under our Court's
precedents, his youth is one factor, among others, that should be
considered in deciding whether his punishment was unconstitutionally
excessive. In my view, Graham's age--- together with the nature of his
criminal activity and the unusual severity of his sentence---tips the
constitutional balance. I thus concur in the Court's judgment that
Graham's sentence of life without parole violated the Eighth Amendment.

I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in every case involving
a juvenile offender. Some crimes are so heinous, and some juvenile
offenders so highly culpable, that a sentence of life without parole may
be entirely justified under the Constitution. **\[ ... \]**

Justice Thomas,

with whom Justice Scalia joins, and with whom Justice Alito joins as to
Parts I and III, dissenting.

The Court holds today that it is "grossly disproportionate" and hence
unconstitutional for any judge or jury to impose a sentence of life
without parole on an offender less than 18 years old, unless he has
committed a homicide. Although the text of the Constitution is silent
regarding the permissibility of this sentencing practice, and although
it would not have offended the standards that prevailed at the founding,
the Court insists that the standards of American society have evolved
such that the Constitution now requires its prohibition.

The news of this evolution will, I think, come as a surprise to the
American people. Congress, the District of Columbia, and 37 States allow
judges and juries to consider this sentencing practice in juvenile
nonhomi-cide cases, and those judges and juries have decided to use it
in the very worst cases they have encountered.

The Court does not conclude that life without parole itself is a cruel
and unusual punishment. It instead rejects the judgments of those
legislatures, judges, and juries regarding what the Court describes as
the "moral" question whether this sentence can ever be
"proportiona\[te\]" when applied to the category of offenders at issue
here. *Ante,* at 58, 59, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 835-836 (internal quotation
marks omitted); *ante,* at 85, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 853 (Stevens, J.,
concurring).

I am unwilling to assume that we, as Members of this Court, are any more
capable of making such moral judgments than our fellow citizens. Nothing
in our training as judges qualifies us for that task, and nothing in
Article III gives us that authority.

I respectfully dissent.

The ultimate question in this case is not whether a life-without-parole
sentence "fits" the crime at issue here or the crimes of juvenile
nonhomicide offenders more generally, but to whom the Constitution
assigns that decision. The Florida Legislature has concluded that such
sentences should be available for persons under 18 who commit certain
crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to impose that
legislatively authorized sentence here. Because a life-without-parole
prison sentence is not a "cruel and unusual" method

**\[ ... \]**

of punishment under any standard, the Eighth Amendment gives this Court
no authority to reject those judgments.

Review: Some Questions on Graham and Ewing

 

Graham:

1\. What did the Court rely on in findng minors less culpable and more
deterrable than adults?

2\. How did the Court distinguish between a 14 year old, a 17 year old,
and a 20 year old? Can it?

 

Ewing:

1\. Under the rationale of Ewing, when would a punishment be
disproportionate? Put another way, how did the court define harm
(hint\--was it about Ewing\'s actions, or the cost of shoplifting more
broadly) and risk?

2\. Given this still-binding decision, what (federal) constitutional
limitations exist on incarceration terms for adults?

**\[ ... \]**

SIMPSON, Judge.

Appellant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway, and appeals.
Officers of the law arrested him at his home and took him onto the
highway, where he allegedly committed the proscribed acts, viz.,
manifested a drunken condition by using loud and profane language.

The pertinent provisions of our statute are: "Any person who, while
intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more
persons are present, \* \* \* and manifests a drunken condition by
boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on
conviction, be fined", etc. Code 1940, Title 14, Section 120.

Under the plain terms of this statute, a voluntary appearance is
presupposed. The rule has been declared, and we think it sound, that an
accusation of drunkenness in a designated public place cannot be
established by proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated
condition, was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the
arresting officer. **\[ ... \]**

Conviction of appellant was contrary to this announced principle and, in
our view, erroneous. It appears that no legal conviction can be
sustained under the evidence, so, consonant with the prevai1ing rule,
the judgment of the trial court is reversed and one here rendered
discharging appellant. **\[ ... \]**

Notes & Questions (Martin v State)

 

**Notes & Questions**

1.  **Using Martin, consider the following scenario:**

Under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), U.S. federal law allows criminal charges to be
brought against non-citizens without the correct immigration documents
who are "at any time found in\" the U.S.

Pat, a Canadian citizen, lives in Canada near the U.S. border.  Pat is
kidnapped and forcibly brought into the United States.  Is Pat guilty?

2.  **Punishing Thoughts?**

The phrase "I'm going to kill you" has become somewhat of a colloquial
expression of anger.  In Twelve Angry Men the main character lists
different scenarios in which people use this phrase, but don't actually
mean it.  Take it a step back.  What if, on your morning commute,
someone cuts you off and you think in your head a variation of the above
phrase.  Can the law punish you for this thought?

3.  **Involuntary vs Voluntary Acts. Consider the following
    statements:**

\(a\) David stretched his leg.

\(b\) David's leg extended.

While these two statements seem to describe the same situation, sentence
(b) could be an involuntary act.  What if his little brother pulled
David\'s leg, causing David to kick someone?  Or a doctor hit his
kneecap, causing a reflexive reaction?

\"\[T\]o make a complete crime, cognizable by human laws, there must be
both a will and an act. For though . . . a fixed design or will to do an
unlawful act is almost as heinous as the commission of it, yet, as no
temporal tribunal can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of the
mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it
therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know. For which reason in all
temporal jurisdictions **an overt act, or some open evidence of an
intended crime, is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of
the will, before the man is liable to punishment.**\"

**\[ ... \]**

John Frey and Herbert Heanes were officers of the Oakland Police
Department. The criminal charges against defendant arose from a street
altercation in which Frey was fatally wounded by gunfire, and Heanes and
defendant were shot, on October 28, 1967. Through the testimony of
Oakland police radio dispatcher Clarence Lord, and a tape recording of
the radio transmissions mentioned therein, the People showed that the
following events first occurred on the date in question:

Lord was on radio duty in the Oakland Police Administration Building.
Officer Frey was also on duty, and alone in a police car, patrolling an
assigned beat in Oakland. At about 4:51 a.m., he radioed Lord and
requested a check on an automobile which was moving in his vicinity and
which bore license number AZM 489. Less than a minute later, Lord told
Frey that "we have got some PIN information coming out on that."[**\[
... \]**](#X19323fd75b15f3b02295aa9901a766913206a39)Frey replied, "**\[
... \]**It's a known Black Panther vehicle. . . . **\[ ... \]**I am
going to stop it at Seventh and Willow \[Streets\]. You might send a
unit by." **\[ ... \]** Officer Heanes, who was listening to this
conversation in his police car on another beat, called in that he was
"enroute" to Seventh and Willow Streets. This transmission terminated at
about 4:52 a.m.

A few minutes later Frey asked Lord by radio, "you got any information
on this guy yet?" Explaining this call, Lord testified that "when I gave
him \[Frey\] the information there was PIN information he made the car
stop on the strength of that, on the strength of the PIN information. He
\[now\] wants to know what information I have that told him to stop the
vehicle." Lord gave Frey the name "LaVerne Williams" and asked him "if
there were a LaVerne Williams in the vehicle." Frey replied in the
affirmative. Lord told him there were a "couple\" of warrants issued to
LaVerne Williams, for parking violations, on the identified vehicle.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Officer Heanes testified for the People as follows: **\[ ... \]**At this
time, two men were seated in the Volkswagen, both in the front seat;
Officer Frey was standing near the driver's door of the vehicle, writing
a citation. **\[ ... \]**

Heanes walked forward to the Volkswagen, addressed defendant as "Mr.
Williams," and asked if he had any further identification. Defendant,
still seated in the vehicle, said "I am Huey Newton." Frey then
approached the Volkswagen and conversed with Heanes, who asked defendant
to get out of the car. Defendant asked "if there was any particular
reason why he\' should." Heanes asked him "if there was any reason why
he didn't want to." Frey then informed defendant that he was under
arrest ánd ordered him out of the car.

Defendant got out of the Volkswagen and walked, "rather briskly" and in
a westerly direction, to the rear of the police cars. Frey followed,
three or four feet behind defendant and slightly to his (defendant's)
right. Heanes followed them, but stopped at the front end of Frey's
police car (the second car in line). Defendant walked to the "rear part"
of Heanes's car (third in line), Frey still behind him, and turned
around. He assumed a stance with his feet apart, knees flexed, both
"arms down" at hip level in front of his body.

Heanes heard a gunshot and saw Officer Frey move toward defendant. As he
(Heanes) drew and raised his own gun in his right hand, a bullet struck
his right forearm. He grabbed his arm "momentarily" and noticed, from
the comer of his eye, a man standing on the curb between the Volkswagen
and Officer Frey's police car. Heanes turned and aimed his gun at the
man (whom he apparently identified at the time as defendant's passenger,
although he had not seen the passenger get out of the Volkswagen). The
man "raised his hands and stated to me he wasn't armed, and he had no
intentions of harming me." To the best of Heanes' knowledge, the man's
hands were empty.

Heanes returned his attention to Officer Frey and defendant, who were
"on the trunk lid of my car \[the third car in line\] tussling." The two
were in "actual physical contact" and "seemed to be wrestling all over
the trunk**\[ ... \]**area of my car." He next remembered being on his
knees**\[ ... \]**approximately "30, 35 feet" from the other two men.
Defendant was then facing him; Officer Frey was "facing from the side"
of defendant, toward the curb, and appeared to be "hanging onto" him.
Holding his gun in his left hand, Heanes aimed at defendant and fired
"at his midsection." Defendant did not fall; Heanes saw no one fall at
any time. He (Heanes) then heard "other gunshots . . . from the area of
where Officer Frey and . . . \[defendant\] . . . were tussling on the
rear part of my car."[**\[ ...
\]**](#X3c019a26df067d3b5c2cf0017221fadb054bab0) Heanes did not see a
gun in defendant's hand at any time. He next remembered "laying" in
Officer Frey's police car, and calling an "emergency 940B" on its radio.
After that, and through the vehicle's rear window, he saw two men
running in a westerly direction toward Seventh and Willow Streets.

Henry Grier, a bus driver employed by AC Transit, gave this testimony
for the People: Driving his empty bus westbound on Seventh Street at
about 4:58 a.m. on October 28, 1967, he saw the three vehicles parked at
the south curb, "about bumper to bumper," west of Willow Street. "Red
lights" were flashing on the police cars. He also saw two uniformed
police officers and two "civilians" standing together in the street, to
his left and next to the Volkswagen. He continued west on Seventh Street
to a turnaround point two blocks west of Willow Street, turned without
stopping, returned on Seventh Street in an eastbound direction, and
stopped to pick up two bus passengers at Willow Street.

Continuing east on Seventh Street, Grier again came upon the three
parked vehicles. This was four to five minutes after he passed them
while headed west. He saw the same flashing lights on the police cars,
and three men in the street. Two of them, a police officer and a
"civilian," were walking toward the bus. When Grier first saw them, they
were 20-25 feet distant from him and a point between the Volkswagen and
the first police car parked behind it. The officer was walking a "pace"
behind the civilian, and was apparently holding him "sort of tugged
under the arm." The third man in the street was another police officer,
who was walking in the same direction about "ten paces" behind the first
officer and the civilian. (Grier did not then, or again, see the other
"civilan" he had noticed when driving west on Seventh Street.)

As the first pair drew closer to the bus, which was still "rolling," the
civilian pulled a gun from inside his shirt and "spun around." The first
police officer "grabbed him by the arm." The two struggled, and "the gun
went off." The officer walking behind them "was hit and he fell"; after
he was hit, he drew his gun and fired. Grier stopped the bus immediately
and called "central dispatch" on its radio. At this point, the first
officer and the civilian were struggling near the front door of the bus
and within a few feet of Grier. He saw the civilian, standing "sort of
in a crouched position," fire several shots into the first officer as
the latter was falling forward.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X28c04e3eb2cb1cdc02e07740419ad71dcf9582b)These shots were fired
from, or within, a distance of "four or five feet" from the midsection
of the officer's body; the last one was fired "in the direction of his
back" as he lay, face down, on the ground. While these shots were being
fired, Grier was saying on the bus radio, "Get help, a police officer is
being shot. Shots are flying everywhere; get help. Help, quick." After
firing the last shot at the fallen officer, the civilian "went
diagonally across Seventh \[Street\]." At the trial, Grier positively
identified defendant as the "civilian" mentioned in his account of the
shootings.

**\[ ... \]**

Defendant arrived at the emergency desk of Kaiser Hospital at 5:50 a.m.
on the same morning. He asked to see a doctor, stating "I have been shot
in the stomach." A nurse called the police. Officer Robert Fredericks
arrived and placed defendant under arrest. He (defendant) had a bullet
wound in his abdomen. The bullet had entered in the front and exited
through the back of his body.

Officers Frey and Heanes were taken to Merritt Hospital, where Frey was
dead on arrival. He had been shot five times, at approximately the same
time but in an unknown order. One bullet entered in the front, and
exited through the back, of his left shoulder; another passed through
his left thigh, also from front to back. A third (the only one recovered
from Frey's body) entered the midback and lodged near the left hip. A
fourth creased the left elbow. Another bullet entered the back,
traversed the lungs, and exited through the right shoulder in front:
this wound caused Officer Frey's death within 10 minutes. Officer Heanes
had three bullet wounds: one in his right arm, one in the left knee, one
in the chest.

**\[ ... \]**

*Defense Evidence*

**\[ ... \]**

Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, denied killing Officer Frey,
shooting Officer Heanes, or carrying a gun on the morning of the
shootings. His account of the episode was as follows: He was driving
with Gene McKinney on Willow Street, and had just turned into Seventh
Street when he noticed a red light through the rear window of the
Volkswagen. He pulled over to the curb and stopped. Officer Frey
approached the Volkswagen and said "Well, well, well, what do we have?
The great, great Huey P. Newton." Frey asked for defendant's driver's
license \"and inquired as to the ownership of the Volkswagen. Defendant
handed him his (defendant's) license, and the vehicle registration, and
said that the car belonged to LaVeme Williams. Officer Frey returned the
license and walked back to his patrol car with the registration.

A few minutes later Officer Heanes arrived, conversed with Frey, then
walked up to the Volkswagen and asked, "Mr. Williams, do you have any
further identification?" Defendant said, "What do\' you mean, Mr.
Williams? My name is Huey P. Newton . . ." Heanes replied, "Yes, I know
who you are." Officer Frey then ordered defendant out of the car. He got
out, taking with him a criminal law book in his right hand. He asked if
he was under arrest; Officer Frey said no, but ordered defendant to lean
against the car. Frey then searched him, placing his hands inside
defendant's trousers and touching his genitals. (Officer Heanes had
testified that defendant was not searched at any time.) **\[ ... \]**

Seizing defendant's left arm with his right hand, Officer Frey told him
to go back to his patrol car. Defendant walked, with the officer "kind
of pushing" him, past the first police car to the back door of the
second one. Defendant opened his book[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xda1fef2acfbe7a490e2215911f740bec58039f6) and said, "You have no
reasonable cause to arrest me." The officer said, "You can take that
book and stick it up your ass, N*\*\*\*\*\*\**." He then struck
defendant in the face, dazing him. Defendant stumbled backwards and fell
to one knee. Officer Frey drew a revolver. Defendant felt a "sensation
like . . . boiling hot soup had been spilled on my stomach," and heard
an "explosion," then a "volley of shots." He remembered "crawling \... a
moving sensation," but nothing else until he found himself at the
entrance of Kaiser Hospital with no knowledge of how he arrived there.
He expressly testified that he was "unconscious or semiconscious" during
this interval, that he was "still only semiconscious" at the hospital
entrance, and that---after recalling some events at Kaiser Hospital---he
later "regained consciousness" at another hospital.

The defense called Bernard Diamond, M.D., who testified that defendant's
recollections were "compatible" with the gunshot wound he had received;
and that "\[a\] gunshot wound which penetrates in a body cavity, the
abdominal cavity or the thoracic cavity is very likely to produce a
profound reflex shock reaction, that is quite different than a gunshot
wound which penetrates only skin and muscle and it is not at all
uncommon for a person shot in the abdomen to lose consciousness and go
into this reflex shock condition for short periods of time up to half an
hour or so."

*The Instructions Upon Unconsciousness*

Defendant asserts prejudicial error in the trial court's failure to
instruct the jury on the subject of *unconsciousness* as a defense to a
charge of criminal homicide. **\[ ... \]**

Although the evidence of the fatal affray is both conflicting and
confused as to who shot whom and when, some of it supported the
inference that defendant had been shot in the abdomen before he fired
any shots himself.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6ba681b630e4123006a1bcdd83d55ec9ace5dd6)Given this sequence,
defendant's testimony of his sensations when shot--- supplemented to a
degree, as it was, by Dr. Diamond's opinion based upon the nature of the
abdominal wound---supported the further inference that defendant was in
a state of unconsciousness when Officer Frey was shot.

Where not self-induced, as by voluntary intoxication or the equivalent
**\[ ... \]***,* unconsciousness is a complete defense to a charge of
criminal homicide. (Pen. Code, § 26, subd. Five**\[ ... \]**)
"Unconsciousness," as the term is used in the rule just cited, need not
reach the physical dimensions commonly associated with the term (coma,
inertia, incapability of locomotion or manual action, and so on); it can
exist---and the above-stated rule can apply---where the subject
physically acts in fact but is not, at the time, conscious of
acting.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xffb3e45834c6c604f412a2dfdda45ba72d3c73d) Thus,
the rule has been invoked in many cases where the actor fired multiple
gunshots while inferably in a state of such "unconsciousness" **\[ ...
\]**, including some in which the only evidence of "unconsciousness" was
the actor's own testimony that he did not recall the shooting.

Where evidence of involuntary unconsciousness has been produced in a
homicide prosecution, the refusal of a requested instruction on the
subject, and its effect as a complete defense if found to have existed,
is prejudicial error. **\[ ... \]** The fact, if it appears, that such
evidence does not inspire belief does not authorize the failure to
instruct: "However incredible the testimony of a defendant may be he is
entitled to an instruction based upon the hypothesis that it is entirely
true." **\[ ... \]** It follows that the evidence of defendant's
unconsciousness in the present case was "deserving of consideration"
upon a material issue. **\[ ... \]**

We hold, therefore, that the trial court should have given appropriate
unconsciousness instructions upon its own motion in the present case,
and that its omission to do so was prejudicial error. **\[ ... \]**

New York Court of Appeals

2 N.Y.2d 133

1956-11-29

**\[ ... \]**

FROESSEL, J.

At about 3:30 P.M. on March 14, 1955, a bright, sunny day, defendant was
driving, alone in his car, in a northerly direction on Delaware Avenue
in the city of Buffalo. **\[ ... \]**At a point south of an overhead
viaduct of the Erie Railroad, defendant\'s car swerved to the left,
across the center line in the street, so that it was completely in the
south lane, traveling 35 to 40 miles per hour.

It then veered sharply to the right, crossing Delaware Avenue and
mounting the easterly curb at a point beneath the viaduct and continued
thereafter at a speed estimated to have been about 50 or 60 miles per
hour or more. **\[ ... \]**

A group of six schoolgirls were walking north on the easterly sidewalk
of Delaware Avenue, two in front and four slightly in the rear, when
defendant\'s car struck them from behind. One of the girls escaped
injury by jumping against the wall of the viaduct. **\[ ... \]** Three
of the children, 6 to 12 years old, were found dead on arrival by the
medical examiner, and a fourth child, 7 years old, died in a hospital
two days later as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.

After striking the children, defendant\'s car continued on the easterly
sidewalk, and then swerved back onto Delaware Avenue once more. It
continued in a northerly direction**\[ ... \]**until it finally crashed
through a 7¼-inch brick wall of a grocery store, injuring at least one
customer and causing considerable property damage.

**\[ ... \]**Defendant was stooped over in the car and was \"bobbing a
little\". To one witness he appeared dazed, to another unconscious,
lying back with his hands off the wheel. Various people present shouted
to defendant to turn off the ignition of his car, and \"within a matter
of seconds the horn stopped blowing and the car did shut off\".

Defendant was pulled out of the car **\[ ... \]** and laid down on the
sidewalk. To a policeman who came on the scene shortly he appeared
\"injured, dazed\"; another witness said that \"he looked as though he
was knocked out, and his arm seemed to be bleeding\". An injured
customer in the store, after receiving first aid, pressed defendant for
an explanation of the accident and he told her: \"I blacked out from the
bridge\".

**\[ ... \]**

*\[At the hospital, Decina,\]* who still felt a little dizzy or blurry,
said that as he was driving he noticed a jerking of his right hand,
which warned him that he might develop a convulsion, and that as he
tried to steer the car over to the curb he felt himself becoming
unconscious, and he thought he had a convulsion. He was aware that
children were in front of his car, but did not know whether he had
struck them.

Defendant then proceeded to relate to Dr. Wechter his past medical
history,**\[ ... \]**In 1946 he was treated in this same hospital for an
illness during which he had some convulsions. Several burr holes were
made in his skull and a brain abscess was drained. Following this
operation defendant had no convulsions from 1946 through 1950. In 1950
he had four convulsions, caused by scar tissue on the brain. From 1950
to 1954 he experienced about 10 or 20 seizures a year, in which his
right hand would jump although he remained fully conscious. In 1954, he
had 4 or 5 generalized seizures with loss of consciousness, the last
being in September, 1954, a few months before the accident. Thereafter
he had more hospitalization, a spinal tap, consultation with a
neurologist, and took medication daily to help prevent seizures.

On the basis of this medical history, Dr. Wechter made a diagnosis of
Jacksonian epilepsy, and was of the opinion that defendant had a seizure
at the time of the accident. **\[ ... \]**

Defendant was indicted and charged with violating section 1053-a of the
Penal Law[^15]. *\[See concurrence, below, for the relevant text of the
statute.\]*

We turn first to the subject of defendant\'s cross appeal, namely, that
**\[ ... \]**the *indictment* here does not charge a crime. The
indictment states essentially that defendant, *knowing* \"that he was
subject to epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to
lose consciousness for a considerable period of time\", was culpably
negligent \"in that he *consciously* undertook to and *did operate* his
Buick sedan on a public highway\" (emphasis supplied) and \"while so
doing\" suffered such an attack which caused said automobile \"to travel
at a fast and reckless rate of speed, jumping the curb and driving over
the sidewalk\" causing the death of 4 persons. In our opinion, this
clearly states a violation of section 1053-a of the Penal Law. The
statute does not require that a defendant must deliberately intend to
kill a human being, for that would be murder. Nor does the statute
require that he knowingly and consciously follow the precise path that
leads to death and destruction. It is sufficient, we have said, when his
conduct manifests a \"disregard of the consequences which may ensue from
the act, and indifference to the rights of others. No clearer
definition, applicable to the hundreds of varying circumstances that may
arise, can be given. Under a given state of facts, whether negligence is
culpable is a question of judgment.\" **\[ ... \]**

Assuming the truth of the indictment, as we must on a demurrer, this
defendant knew he was subject to epileptic**\[ ... \]**attacks and
seizures that might strike *at any time*. He also knew that a moving
motor vehicle uncontrolled on a public highway is a highly dangerous
instrumentality capable of unrestrained destruction. With this
*knowledge*, and without anyone accompanying him, he deliberately took a
chance by making a conscious choice of a course of action, in disregard
of the consequences which he knew might follow from his conscious act,
and which in this case did ensue. How can we say as a matter of law that
this did not amount to culpable negligence within the meaning of section
1053-a?

To hold otherwise would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself
in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if
it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and
reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or
involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution under
the statute. His awareness of a condition which he knows may produce
such consequences as here, and his disregard of the consequences,
renders him liable for culpable negligence, as the courts below have
properly held **\[ ... \]**. To have a sudden sleeping spell, an
unexpected heart or other disabling attack, without any prior knowledge
or warning thereof, is an altogether different situation**\[ ... \]**,
and there is simply no basis for comparing such cases with the flagrant
disregard manifested here.

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed[^16].

**\[ ... \]**DESMOND, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

I agree that the judgment of conviction cannot stand but I think the
indictment should be dismissed because it alleges no crime. Defendant\'s
demurrer should have been sustained.

The indictment charges that defendant knowing that \"he was subject to
epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to lose
consciousness\" suffered \"an attack and loss of consciousness which
caused the said automobile operated by the said defendant to travel at a
fast and reckless rate of speed\" and to jump a curb and run onto the
sidewalk \"thereby striking and causing the death\" of 4 children.
Horrible as this occurrence was and whatever necessity it may show for
new licensing and driving laws, nevertheless this indictment charges no
crime known to the New York statutes. Our duty is to dismiss it.

Section 1053-a of the Penal Law describes the crime of \"criminal
negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death\". Declared
to be guilty of that crime is \"A person who operates or drives any
vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby
a human being is killed\". The essentials of the crime are, therefore,
first, vehicle *operation* in a culpably negligent *manner*, and,
second, the resulting death of a person.**\[ ... \]**No *operation* of
an automobile in a reckless manner is charged against defendant. The
excessive speed of the car and its jumping the curb were \"caused\",
says the indictment itself, by defendant\'s prior \"attack and loss of
consciousness\". Therefore, what defendant is accused of is *not*
reckless or culpably negligent driving, which necessarily connotes and
involves consciousness and volition. The fatal assault by this car was
after and because of defendant\'s failure of consciousness. To say that
one drove a car in a reckless manner in that his unconscious condition
caused the car to travel recklessly is to make two mutually
contradictory assertions. One cannot be \"reckless\" while unconscious.
One cannot while unconscious**\[ ... \]**\"operate\" a car in a culpably
negligent manner or in any other \"manner\". The statute makes criminal
a particular kind of knowing, voluntary, immediate operation.**\[ ...
\]**

**\[ ... \]**

Numerous are the diseases and other conditions of a human being which
make it possible or even likely that the afflicted person will lose
control of his automobile. Epilepsy, coronary involvements, circulatory
diseases, nephritis, uremic poisoning, diabetes, Meniere\'s syndrome, a
tendency to fits of sneezing, locking of the knee, muscular contractions
--- any of these common conditions may cause loss of control of a
vehicle for a period long enough to cause a fatal accident. An
automobile traveling at only 30 miles an hour goes 44 feet in a second.
Just what is the court holding here? No less than**\[ ... \]**this: that
a driver whose brief blackout lets his car run amuck and kill another
has killed that other by reckless driving. But any such \"recklessness\"
consists necessarily not of the erratic behavior of the automobile while
its driver is unconscious, but of his driving at all when he knew he was
subject to such attacks. Thus, it must be that such a blackout-prone
driver is guilty of reckless driving**\[ ... \]**whenever and as soon as
he steps into the driver\'s seat of a vehicle. Every time he drives,
accident or no accident, he is subject to criminal prosecution for
reckless driving or to revocation of his operator\'s license**\[ ...
\]**. And how many of this State\'s 5,000,000 licensed operators are
subject to such penalties for merely driving the cars they are licensed
to drive? No one knows **\[ ... \]**. It is no answer that prosecutors
and juries will be reasonable or compassionate. A criminal statute whose
reach is so unpredictable violates constitutional rights**\[ ... \]**.

Sample Problem based on Cogdon case.

 

A problem based on *The King v. Cogdon*, an unreported Canadian case
described by Norval Morris in *Somnambulistic Homicide: Ghosts, Spiders,
and North Koreans*, 5 Res Judicatae 29 (1951):

\[Mrs. Cogdon\] told how, on the night before her daughter\'s death, she
had dreamt that their house was full of spiders and that these spiders
were crawling all over \[her daughter\] Pat. In her sleep, Mrs. Cogdon
left the bed she shared with her husband, went into Pat\'s room, and
awakened to find herself violently brushing at Pat\'s face, presumably
to remove the spiders. This woke Pat. Mrs. Cogdon told her she was just
tucking her in.  There had also been a previous dream in which ghosts
had sat at the end of Mrs. Cogdon\'s bed and she had said to them,
"Well, you have come to take Pattie."

The morning after the spider dream she told her doctor of it. He gave
her a sedative and, because of the dream and certain previous
difficulties she had reported, discussed the possibility of psychiatric
treatment. \[That evening, Mrs. Cogdon put Pat to sleep while Mr. Cogdon
was out for the evening.\] There was some desultory conversation between
them about the war in Korea, and just before she put out her light Pat
called out to her mother, "Mum, don\'t be so silly worrying there about
the war, it\'s not on our front door step yet."

Mrs. Cogdon went to sleep. She dreamt that "the war was all around the
house," that soldiers were in Pat\'s room, and that one soldier was on
the bed attacking Pat. This was all of the dream she could later
recapture. Her first "waking" memory was of running from Pat\'s room,
out of the house to the home of her sister who lived next door. When her
sister opened the front door Mrs. Cogdon fell into her arms, crying, "I
think I\'ve hurt Pattie."

In fact Mrs. Cogdon had, in her somnambulistic state, left her bed,
fetched an axe from the woodheap, entered Pat\'s room, and struck her
two accurate forceful blows on the head with the blade of the axe, thus
killing her.

1.  What is the best argument in favor of holding Mrs. Cogdon criminally
    responsible for the death of her daughter?

2.  What is the strongest argument *against* holding her criminally
    responsible?

Possession - Louisiana v. Booth

 

Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit.

STATE of Louisiana v. Walter BOOTH.

Oct. 20, 1999.

 

... Defendant Walter Booth, Jr., was charged by bill of information with
possession of heroin, to which he pled not guilty. A twelve-person jury
found him guilty as charged on February 19, 1998 \[and\] he was
sentenced to five years at hard labor....

New Orleans Police Officer Travis McCabe testified that on October 20,
1997, he conducted an investigation of 2309 Sixth Street, Apartment 2,
after he and Sergeant Steven Gaudet received information from a
confidential informant. The officers later applied for and received a
search warrant for the premises. He and Sgt. Gaudet, along with two
other officers and a dog trained to search for drugs, executed the
warrant \[early in the morning on October 21, 1997\]. \[Mr. Booth and
Gail Varnado were both at the apartment at the time it was searched.\]
Officer McCabe described the apartment as small, consisting of one
bedroom, one bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen. The search dog
located narcotics inside a wall-mounted heater. Officer McCabe opened
the vent on the bottom and found a plastic package containing
approximately twenty-seven aluminum foil packages of heroin. The
officers also discovered on top of a curio cabinet, a large felt hat
containing a syringe, a long piece of rubber, and a small plastic bag
containing five additional small foil packages of heroin. Officer McCabe
also recovered an Entergy electric bill in Mr. Booth's name, and a
letter from a religious organization addressed to both him and Ms.
Varnado, both of which were addressed to 2309 Sixth Street, Apartment
"D." At that point, Mr. Booth and Ms. Varnado were advised of their
rights and arrested.

On cross-examination, Officer McCabe admitted that none of the drugs was
in plain view, and that initially the focus of the police investigation
was Ms. Varnado. He said he had occasion to watch the apartment from a
distance, and witnessed an informant make a purchase from Ms. Varnado
with a marked twenty-dollar bill, although this marked twenty-dollar
bill was not found during the search of the apartment....

Sergeant Steve Gaudet explained that he remained in the area of the
apartment complex while Officer McCabe went to obtain the search
warrant. He detained Ms. Varnado outside of the apartment as she was
leaving, and took her inside, where Mr. Booth was seated in the front
room, clad only in a pair of boxer shorts. He said the wall-mounted
heater where the drugs were found was next to the sofa where Mr. Booth
was seated. ...

Mr. Booth testified in his own behalf, and stated that on October 20 and
21, 1997, he was living at the Sixth Street address, but Ms. Varnado,
whom he stated was his fiancée, was not living there. In fact, Mr. Booth
had no idea where Ms. Varnado was living at that time. He had agreed
only that Ms. Varnado could stay at his apartment that particular night,
in the front room. Mr. Booth claimed that when police found him he was
sleeping in the bedroom, and they awakened him and asked where Ms.
Varnado was. He denied knowledge of any drugs in the heater or in the
hat.

On cross-examination, Mr. Booth again stated that Ms. Varnado was his
fiancée, but said he and she "had a legal separation\..." He again
denied being awake sitting in the living room when police entered the
apartment. Mr. Booth said the letter addressed to Ms. Varnado found in
his apartment was brought with her from her jail cell. He explained that
she recently had been paroled, and was going to live with him, but they
had an altercation and he put her out. He said she asked to stay in the
front room for a couple of days, and that was how the letter got there.
Mr. Booth admitted to a 1995 conviction for "having a gun," a conviction
for possession of marijuana, a 1975 conviction for being a convicted
felon in possession of a firearm, and a conviction for armed robbery. .
.

... Mr. Booth claims that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his
conviction. . . "In evaluating whether evidence is constitutionally
sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court must determine
whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
prosecution, any rational trier of act could have found the defendant
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.... If rational triers of fact could
disagree as to the interpretation of the evidence, the rational trier's
view of all the evidence most favorable to the prosecution must be
adopted...."

La.Rev.Stat. 40:966(C) makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or
intentionally possess heroin, a controlled dangerous substance
classified in Schedule I. \[Prior caselaw makes clear that\] \"The State
need not prove that the defendant was in actual possession of the
narcotics found; constructive possession is sufficient to support
conviction. The mere presence of a defendant in the area where the
narcotics were found is insufficient to prove constructive possession. A
person not in physical possession of narcotics may have constructive
possession when the drugs are under that person's dominion and control.
A person may be deemed to be in joint possession of a drug which is in
the physical possession of a companion if he willfully and knowingly
shares with the other the right to control it. Determination of whether
a defendant had constructive possession depends on the circumstances of
each case. Among the factors to consider in determining whether the
defendant exercised dominion and control sufficient to constitute
constructive possession are whether the defendant knew that illegal
drugs were present in the area, the defendant's relationship to the
person in actual possession of the drugs, whether there is evidence of
recent drug use, the defendant's proximity to the drugs, and any
evidence that the area is frequented by drug users.\"

In the instant case, police observed Ms. Varnado sell narcotics to an
informant out of Mr. Booth's apartment. She was detained and taken
inside of the apartment, where she admittedly was staying. Mr. Booth
admitted that Ms. Varnado was his fiancée. Accepting the testimony of
Officer McCabe, Mr. Booth was in the front room when police entered.
Heroin was found in a wall-mounted heater next to where Mr. Booth was
seated, and more heroin and drug paraphernalia was found in a curio
cabinet in the living room. A letter found in the apartment was
addressed to Mr. Booth and Ms. Varnado, at the apartment in question.

Mr. Booth's testimony conflicted with that of police officers in that he
said he was sleeping in his bedroom when police entered the apartment
and asked him where Ms. Varnado was. He disputed that the police took
Ms. Varnado into custody outside, and brought her into the apartment
when they entered. Mr. Booth denied any knowledge of the drugs in his
apartment, and said his fiancée was only staying at his apartment
temporarily. The jury knew that Mr. Booth had prior convictions for
armed robbery, possession of marijuana, and being a convicted felon in
possession of a firearm. The jury obviously did not believe that Mr.
Booth was not aware of the heroin found in two locations in his
apartment. The trier of fact's determination of credibility should not
to be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. . .

In the instant case, viewing all of the evidence in a light most
favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have
found that Mr. Booth knowingly exercised dominion and control over the
heroin found in his apartment, and that all of the essential elements of
the offense of possession of heroin were proven beyond a reasonable
doubt....

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mr. Booth's conviction....

WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.

Appellant, together with one Shirley Green, was tried on a three-count
indictment charging them jointly with (1) abusing and maltreating Robert
Lee Green, (2) abusing and maltreating Anthony Lee Green,[^17] and (3)
involuntary manslaughter through failure to perform their legal duty of
care for Anthony Lee Green, which failure resulted in his death.[**\[
... \]**](#X97799b1f251c8c56a7bc742496a67ead46a4655)At the close of
evidence, after trial to a jury, the first two counts were dismissed as
to both defendants. On the third count, appellant was convicted of
involuntary manslaughter. Shirley Green was found not guilty.

**\[ ... \]**

In late 1957, Shirley Green became pregnant, out of wedlock, with a
child, Robert Lee, subsequently born August 17, 1958. Apparently to
avoid the embarrassment of the presence of the child in the Green home,
it was arranged that appellant, a family friend, would take the child to
her home after birth. Appellant did so, and the child remained there
continuously until removed by the police on August 5, 1960. Initially
appellant made some motions toward the adoption of Robert Lee, but these
came to nought, and shortly thereafter it was agreed that Shirley Green
was to pay appellant \$72 a month for his care. According to appellant,
these payments were made for only five months. According to Shirley
Green, they were made up to July, 1960.

Early in 1959 Shirley Green again became pregnant, this time with the
child Anthony Lee, whose death is the basis of appellant's conviction.
This child was born October 21, 1959. Soon after birth, Anthony Lee
developed a mild jaundice condition, attributed to a blood
incompatibility with his mother. The jaundice resulted in his retention
in the hospital for three days beyond the usual time, or until October
26, 1959, when, on authorization signed by Shirley Green, Anthony Lee
was released by the hospital to appellant's custody. Shirley Green,
after a two or three day stay in the hospital, also lived with appellant
for three weeks, after which she returned to her parents' home, leaving
the children with appellant. She testified she did not see them again,
except for one visit in March, until August 5, 1960. Consequently,
though there does not seem to have been any specific monetary agreement
with Shirley Green covering Anthony Lee's support,[^18] appellant had
complete custody of both children until they were rescued by the police.

With regard to medical care, the evidence is undisputed. In March, 1960,
appellant called a Dr. Turner to her home to treat Anthony Lee for a
bronchial condition. Appellant also telephoned the doctor at various
times to consult with him concerning Anthony Lee's diet and health. In
early July, 1960, appellant took Anthony Lee to Dr. Turner's office
where he was treated for "simple diarrhea." At this time the doctor
noted the "wizened" appearance of the child and told appellant to tell
the mother of the child that he should be taken to a hospital. This was
not done.

On August 2, 1960, two collectors for the local gas company had occasion
to go to the basement of appellant's home, and there saw the two
children. Robert Lee and Anthony Lee at this time were age two years and
ten months respectively. Robert Lee was in a "crib" consisting of a
framework of wood, covered with a fine wire screening, including the top
which was hinged. The "crib" was lined with newspaper, which was
stained, apparently with feces, and crawling with roaches. Anthony Lee
was lying in a bassinet and was described as having the appearance of a
"small baby monkey." One collector testified to seeing roaches on
Anthony Lee.

On August 5, 1960, the collectors returned to appellant's home in the
company of several police officers and personnel of the Women's Bureau.
At this time, Anthony Lee was upstairs in the dining room in the
bassinet, but Robert Lee was still downstairs in his "crib." The
officers removed the children to the D. C. General Hospital where
Anthony Lee was diagnosed as suffering from severe malnutrition and
lesions over large portions of his body, apparently caused by severe
diaper rash. Following admission, he was fed repeatedly, apparently with
no difficulty, and was described as being very hungry. His death, 34
hours after admission, was attributed without dispute to malnutrition.
At birth, Anthony Lee weighed six pounds, fifteen ounces --- at death at
age ten months, he weighed seven pounds, thirteen ounces. Normal weight
at this age would have been approximately 14 pounds.

**\[ ... \]** *\[T\]he*child had no difficulty in ingesting food
immediately after birth, and that Anthony Lee, in the last hours before
his death, was able to take several bottles, apparently without
difficulty, and seemed very hungry. This evidence, combined with the
absence of any physical cause for nonassimilation, taken in the context
of the condition in which these children were kept, presents a jury
question on the feeding issue.

Moreover, there is substantial evidence from which the jury could have
found that appellant failed to obtain proper medical care for the child.
**\[ ... \]***\[T\]he*last time a doctor saw the child was a month
before his death, and appellant admitted that on that occasion the
doctor recommended hospitalization. Appellant did not hospitalize the
child, nor did she take any other steps to obtain medical care in the
last crucial month. Thus there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury
on the issue of medical care, as well as failure to feed.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe0ece999b6217af1665720cc243d63e696be139)

Appellant also takes exception to the failure of the trial court to
charge that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element
of the crime, that appellant was under a legal duty to supply food and
necessities to Anthony Lee. Appellant's attorney did not object to the
failure to give this instruction, but urges here the application of Rule
52(b).

The problem of establishing the duty to take action which would preserve
the life of another has not often arisen in the case law of this
country.[**\[ ... \]**](#X57a203acce91c248c6d6c6eed9b1b000c827ba9)The
most commonly cited statement of the rule is found in People v.
Beardsley**\[ ... \]**:

> "The law recognizes that under some circumstances the omission of a
> duty owed by one individual to another, where such omission results in
> the death of the one to whom the duty is owing, will make the other
> chargeable with manslaughter. \* \* \* This rule of law is always
> based upon the proposition that the duty neglected must be a legal
> duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by
> law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the
> immediate and direct cause of death. **\[ ... \]**

There are at least four situations in which the failure to act may
constitute breach of a legal duty. One can be held criminally liable:
first, where a statute imposes a duty to care for another;**\[ ... \]**
second, where one stands in a certain status relationship to
another;[**\[ ... \]**](#X7ebe43dad21e5ac3e66aa1aee875ae9e8d23c20)third,
where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another;[**\[ ...
\]**](#X46f98681300aa68580057b8df6db54b97c8a61c)and fourth, where one
has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless
person as to prevent others from rendering aid.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X520266e9b275a25690f71bd5b2564086b925f7c)

It is the contention of the Government that either the third or the
fourth ground is applicable here. However, it*is*obvious that in any of
the four situations, there are critical issues of fact which must be
passed on by the jury --- specifically in this case, whether appellant
had entered into a contract with the mother for the care of Anthony Lee
or, alternatively, whether she assumed the care of the child and
secluded him from the care of his mother, his natural protector. On both
of these issues, the evidence is in direct conflict, appellant insisting
that, the mother was actually living with appellant and Anthony Lee, and
hence-should have been taking care of the child herself, while Shirley
Green testified she was living with her parents and was paying appellant
to care for both children.

In spite of this conflict, the instructions given in the case failed
even to suggest the necessity for finding a legal duty of care. The only
reference to duty in the instructions was the reading of the indictment
which charged, inter alia, that the defendants "failed to perform their
legal duty." A finding of legal duty is the critical element of the
crime charged[**\[ ...
\]**](#X18dfeda320e3445ac33cb9d448699d4c6c7a2a8)and failure to instruct
the jury concerning it was plain error.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X374c483bf8d5bd14e7f933e717b06ea3e1f5a4c)

Since the case will have to be retried, another error should simply be
noted. After the jury had retired for consideration of the case, a
written communication was sent to the judge and answered by him, without
notice to counsel. When counsel learned of this communication, it was
disclosed that the note had been lost. Whereupon, on request of counsel,
the court instructed the foreman of the jury to reconstruct the note.
Counsel, not being satisfied that the note as reconstructed was a
faithful representation of the original, asked that the jury be polled.
This was denied. The note as reconstructed read: "May the jury find both
defendants in this case guilty but also recommend clemency for only one
of the two defendants?" The court's reply stated: "The jury has been
instructed it can only bring in a verdict as to either or both
defendants of guilty or not guilty."

It is obvious error to instruct the jury without notice to counsel.[**\[
... \]**](#Xee25a9a20e686ad33ec6ab4cac7d3991c89a50a)Proper procedure
requires that a jury be instructed in the courtroom in the presence of
counsel and the defendant, and that counsel be given opportunity to
except to the additional instruction.

Reversed and remanded.

Demiko Lee Norris, three months old, died as a result of physical
injuries inflicted by his mother, Melissa Vera Norris.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X30c2a0ce11b8ba4ee4901b4e9180377e80eeeaa) The abuse by the mother
occurred over a period of several hours on a Sunday morning at Pope\'s
home and in Pope's presence. Pope's involvement in the events leading to
the child's abuse and death began on the preceding Friday evening when
she and Melissa, with the child, were driven home by Pope's sister,
Angela Lancaster, from a service held at the Christian Tabernacle
Church. When they arrived at Melissa's grandparents' home, where Melissa
was living, Melissa refused to enter the house, claiming that it was on
fire, although in fact it was not. During the evening, Melissa had
sporadically indicated mental distress. "She would at times seem caught
up in a religious frenzy with a wild look about her, trying to pleach
and declaring that she was God. She would as quickly resume her normal
self without ever seeming to notice her personality transitions."
*Pope,* 38 Md. App. at 531. Pope agreed to take Melissa and thé child
into her home for the night because she did not want to put them "out on
the street," and Angela would not let them stay in her home. Melissa had
no money and Pope and Angela bought food and diapers for the baby. That
evening Pope cleaned and dried the baby and inquired of Melissa about a
bad rash he had. Melissa slept in Pope's bedroom. Pope kept the baby
with her in the living room, telling Melissa: "\[Y\]ou can go to sleep
\... I'll be up, I'll just stay up, I'll watch the baby**\[ ... \]**"
She explained in her testimony: "And I don't know why it was just, just
a funny feeling that I had, you know, and ever since the baby was there
I just kept it close to me for some reason." Pope fed the baby and fixed
a bed for it in a dresser drawer. She stayed with the baby to care for
him during the night because he was spitting up. She could not sleep
while Melissa was there.

The next morning, awakened by the crying of the child, Pope fed him**\[
... \]**. Throughout the day Melissa "changed back and forth." When
Melissa was "herself" she took care of her child. When Melissa thought
she was God, Pope undertook the maternal duties. Pope watched the child
"like it was my own," because "I felt maybe \[Melissa\] could \[hurt the
child\] when she confessed she was God**\[ ... \]**I felt close to the
baby, maybe because, you know, I felt I haven't had a baby for so long,
you know, I enjoyed taking care of the baby and watching it." At a baby
shower Saturday evening at the home of Pope's mother, Melissa again
reverted to being God, looking wild, speaking loudly, preaching and
giving orders. Melissa and the baby returned to Pope's home. Melissa put
the child in bed with her, but Pope thought it better that the child not
remain there. She was afraid Melissa would roll over and "smother it to
death." She told Melissa: "I'll just take the baby in \[the living
room\]\... I'll watch it, I'll get up and feed it\... I don\'t mind."
The next morning, Sunday, at about 4:30 o'clock, Pope prepared the
baby's bottle and fed him. When Melissa got up, Pope suggested that she
go back to bed. Melissa behaved normally for awhile. Then her "episodes
of 'changing to God' became more pronounced. She stomped and gestured as
she strode back and forth, putting crosses on doors and demanding the
departure of the evil which she claimed to see. **\[ ... \]**

During a lucid period, Melissa prepared to go to church. She got a tub
of water to bathe the baby. What next occurred is graphically described
in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals:

Continuing to talk and stomp, Melissa began to squeeze the baby. Then,
holding the child by the neck with one hand, she took him into the
bathroom, acting like she did not know that Pope was present. When she
first started this abuse, Melissa, in her "God voice," called Pope and
asked her: "Didn't I give you eyes to see?" **\[ ... \]** Pope did
nothing. She admitted that she knew at some point that Melissa was
hurting the baby and was "fearful, amazed and shocked at the
'unbelievable' and 'horrible' thing that was happening."

Pope, Melissa and Angela left with the child to go to church. **\[ ...

assistance. Police and rescue personnel arrived and determined that the
child was dead. There was expert medical testimony that the child had
died sometime during the period of fifteen minutes to several hours
after it was injured. The medical expert expressed no opinion as to
whether the child could have been successfully treated if the injury had
been reported sooner.

**\[ ... \]**Pope's lack of any attempt to prevent the numerous acts of
abuse committed by the mother over a relatively protracted period and
her failure to seek medical assistance for the child, although the need
therefor was obviously compelling and urgent, could constitute a cause
for the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to
the child's death. In such circumstances, Pope's omissions constituted
in themselves cruel and inhumane treatment within the meaning of the
statute. **\[ ... \]**It follows that Pope would be guilty of child
abuse *if her status brought her within the class of persons specified
by the statute.* It being clear that she was neither the child's parent
nor adoptive parent, and there being no evidence sufficient to support a
finding that she had "the permanent or temporary care or custody" of the
child **\[ ... \]**so as to be in loco parentis to the child, the sole
question is whether she had "responsibility for the supervision of" the
child in the circumstances. If she had such responsibility the evidence
was legally sufficient to find her guilty of child abuse **\[ ... \]**.

The State would have us translate compassion and concern, acts of
kindness and care, performance of maternal functions, and general help
and aid with respect to the child into responsibility for the
supervision of the child. The crux of its argument is that although Pope
was not under any obligation to assume responsibility for the
supervision of the child at the outset, "once she undertook to house,
feed, and care for \[the mother and child\], she did accept the
responsibility and came within the coverage of the statute." But the
mother was always present.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X72aabbcb2703c8b5b0c9d27e3069b18e55417c4)Pope had no right to
usurp the role of the mother even to the extent of responsibility for
the child's supervision. **\[ ... \]**It would be most incongruous that
acts of hospitality and kindness, made out of common decency and
prompted by sincere concern for the well-being of a mother and her
child, subjected the Good Samaritan to criminal prosecution for abusing
the very child he sought to look after. And it would be especially
ironic were such criminal prosecution to be predicated upon an
obligation to take affirmative action with regard to abuse of the child
by its mother, when such obligation arises solely from those acts of
hospitality and kindness.

The evidence does not show why Pope did not intervene when the mother
abused the child or why she did not, at least, timely seek medical
assistance, when it was obvious that the child was seriously injured.
**\[ ... \]** Pope's conduct, during and after the acts of abuse, must
be evaluated with regard for the rule that although she may have had a
strong moral obligation to help the child, she was under no legal
obligation to do so unless she then had responsibility for the
supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse statute. She
may not be punished as a felon under our system of justice for failing
to fulfill a moral obligation, and the short of it is that she was under
no legal obligation. **\[ ... \]**We hold that the evidence was not
sufficient in law to prove that Pope fell within that class of persons
to whom the child abuse statute applies. **\[ ... \]**

The mental or emotional state of the mother, whereby at times she held
herself out as God, does not change the result. We see no basis in the
statute for an interpretation that a person "has" responsibility for the
supervision of a child, if that person believes or may have reason to
believe that a parent is not capable of caring for the child. There is
no right to make such a subjective judgment in order to divest parents
of their rights and obligations with respect to their minor children,
and therefore, no obligation to do so.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X873075c70c3c946b4cce76bece408d072bf485f)

**\[ ... \]**

The evidence certainly showed that Pope "witnessed a terrible event" and
that she "stood by" while the mother killed the child. But the
culpability for her conduct during the abuse of the child must be
determined strictly within the law or else the basic tenets of our
system of justice are prostituted. There is an understandable feeling of
outrage at what occurred, intensified by the fact that the mother, who
actually beat the child to death, was held to be not responsible for her
criminal acts. But it is the law, not indignation, which governs. The
law requires that Pope's conviction of the felony of child abuse be set
aside as clearly erroneous due to evidentiary insufficiency.

II

*THE CRIME OF MISPRISION OF FELONY*

**\[ ... \]**

We assume, *arguendo,* that misprision of felony was a crime under the
common law of England, and that it became the law of this State **\[ ...
\]**. The question is whether it is to be deemed an indictable offense
in Maryland today. In determining the question, we look first to what
misprision of felony is. According to Blackstone, the crime at common
law consisted merely in the "concealment of a felony which a man knows,
but never assented to**\[ ... \]** 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries \*121.
**\[ ... \]**

We are satisfied**\[ ... \]** that it is not now compatible with our
local circumstances and situation and our general code of laws and
jurisprudence. Maintenance of law and order does not demand its
application, and, overall, the welfare of the inhabitants of Maryland
and society as enjoyed by us today, would not be served by it. If the
Legislature finds it advisable that the people be obligated under peril
of criminal penalty to disclose knowledge of criminal acts, it is, of
course, free to create an offense to that end, within constitutional
limitations, and, hopefully, with adequate safeguards.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X817f86c96f79f2e448274d8ffff2f6e314e0f35)We believe that the
common law offense is not acceptable by today's standards, and we are
not free to usurp the power of the General Assembly by attempting to
fashion one that would be. We hold that misprision of felony is not a
chargeable offense in Maryland.

**\[ ... \]**

We have reversed Pope's conviction of the felony of child abuse because
the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict. She may not be
tried again for that crime. **\[ ... \]**

As we have held that the crime of misprision of felony does not now
exist in Maryland, Pope may not, of course, be retried on a charge of
that crime.

**\[ ... \]**

*Eldridge, J,*

*concurring in part and dissenting in part*

**\[ ... \]**I cannot agree with the majority's restrictive
interpretation of the child abuse statute, which interpretation
furnishes the basis for the majority's conclusion that Pope was not
guilty of child abuse **\[ ... \]**.

The child abuse statute**\[ ... \]**reaches "\[a\]ny parent, adoptive
parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or
custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor child**\[ ...
\]**" **\[ ... \]**

In addition to parents, the child abuse statute applies to "\[a\]ny \...
other person who has \... responsibility for the supervision of a minor
child**\[ ... \]**" The language is clear. Everyone who has
responsibility is covered, regardless of how he obtained such
responsibility.

It is well-established in the law that one may, by his own actions,
voluntarily assume a particular responsibility. That the Legislature
intended to cover such a person is shown by the language *any other
person who has responsibility.* There is no ambiguity here.
Consequently, there is no need to go further in attempting to ascertain
the legislative intent. **\[ ... \]**

Furthermore, even if there existed some ambiguity in the statute, I am
at a loss to know why the majority finds **\[ ... \]**that only those
persons who have been *granted* responsibility by a parent or guardian
should be covered. Nothing in the statutory language indicates, such a
legislative purpose. **\[ ... \]**

The majority appears to be concerned about the "good Samaritans" who
watch a lost child, or allow neighbors' children to play in their yards
and exercise supervision, or perform "functions of a maternal nature
from concern for the welfare, comfort or health of a child." However,
such "good Samaritans" have nothing to fear from the child abuse
statute. But, if one of these same individuals assumes responsibility
for the child and batters it, sexually molests it, locks it for a long
period of time in a dark closet, etc., that person should be held just
as accountable under the child abuse statute as someone else having
responsibility for the child.

My concern in this case is not so much with the decision that the
evidence was insufficient to convict Pope of child abuse. The evidence
may not have been sufficient. Instead, what is troublesome in this case
is the damage which the majority has done to the child abuse statute.

**\[ ... \]206 150 MICHIGAN REPORTS.**

**PEOPLE v. BEARDSLEY.**

**\[ ... \]**

**Decided December 10, 1907.**

**\[ ... \]**

MCALVAY, C. J. Respondent was convicted of manslaughter before the
circuit court for Oakland county, and was sentenced to the State prison
at Jackson for a minimum term of one year and a maximum term not to
exceed five years. He was a married man living at Pontiac, and at the
time the facts herein narrated occurred, he was working as a bartender
and clerk at the Columbia Hotel.**\[ ... \]** His wife being temporarily
absent from the city, respondent arranged with a woman named Blanche
Burns, who at the time was working at another hotel, to go to his
apartments with him. He had been acquainted with her for some time. They
knew each others habits and character. They had drunk liquor together,
and had on two occasions been in Detroit and spent the night together in
houses of assignation. On the evening of Saturday, March 18, 1905, he
met her at the place where she worked, and they went together to his
place of residence. They at once began to drink and continued to drink
steadily, and remained together, day and night, from that time until the
afternoon of the Monday following, except when respondent went to his
work on Sunday afternoon. There was liquor at these rooms, and when it
was all used they were served with bottles of whiskey and beer by a
young man who worked at the Columbia Hotel, and who also attended
respondent\'s fires at the house.**\[ ... \]** On Monday afternoon,
about one o\'clock, the young man went to the house to see if anything
was wanted. At this time he heard respondent say they must fix up the
rooms, and the woman must not be found there by his wife, who was likely
to return at any time. During this visit to the house the woman sent the
young man to a drug store to purchase, with money she gave him, camphor
and morphine tablets. He procured both articles. **\[ ... \]** She
concealed the morphine from respondent\'s notice, and was discovered
putting something into her mouth by him**\[ ... \]**. She in fact was
taking morphine. Respondent struck the box from her hand. Some of the
tablets fell on the floor, and of these, respondent crushed several with
his foot. She picked up and swallowed two of them**\[ ... \]**. The
young man went away soon after this. Respondent called him by telephone
about an hour later, and after he came to the house requested him to
take the woman into the room in the basement which was occupied by a Mr.
Skoba. She was in a stupor and did not rouse when spoken to. Respondent
was too intoxicated to be of any assistance and the young man proceeded
to take her downstairs. While doing this Skoba arrived, and together
they put her in his room on the bed. Respondent requested Skoba to look
after her, and let her out the back way when she waked up. Between nine
and ten o\'clock in the evening Skoba became alarmed at her condition.
He at once called the city marshal and a doctor. An examination by them
disclosed that she was dead.

**\[ ... \]**

The law recognizes that under some circumstances the omission of a duty
owed by one individual to another, where such omission results in the
death of the one to whom the duty is owing, will make the other
chargeable with manslaughter. **\[ ... \]** This rule of law is always
based upon the proposition that the duty neglected must be a legal duty,
and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by law or by
contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and
direct cause of death. **\[ ... \]**

> \"If a person who sustains to another the legal relation of protector,
> as husband to wife, parent to child, master to seaman, etc., knowing
> such person to be in peril of life, willfully or negligently fails to
> make such reasonable and proper efforts to rescue him as be might have
> done with- out jeopardizing his own life or the lives of others, he is
> guilty of manslaughter at least, if by reason of his omis- sion of
> duty the dependent person dies.
>
> \"So one who from domestic relationship, public duty, voluntary
> choice, or otherwise, has the custody and care of a human being,
> helpless either from imprisonment, infancy, sickness, age, imbecility,
> or other incapacity of mind or body, is bound to execute the charge
> with proper diligence and will be held guilty of manslaughter, if by
> culpable negligence he lets the helpless creature die.\" **\[ ... \]**

Seeking for a proper determination of the case at bar by the application
of the legal principles involved, we must eliminate from the case all
consideration of mere moral obligation, and discover whether respondent
was under a legal duty towards Blanche Burns at the time of her death,
knowing her to be in peril of her life, which required him to make all
reasonable and proper effort to\
save her; the omission to perform which duty would make him responsible
for her death. **\[ ... \]** The record in this case discloses that the
deceased was a woman past 30 years of age. She had been twice married.
She was accustomed to visiting saloons and to the use of intoxicants.
She previously had made assignations with this man in Detroit at least
twice. There is no evidence or claim from this record that any duress,
fraud, or deceit had been practiced upon her. On the contrary it appears
that she went upon this carouse with respondent voluntarily and so
continued to remain with him. Her entire conduct indicates that she had
ample experience in such affairs.

It is urged by the prosecutor that the respondent \"stood towards this
woman for the time being in the place of her natural guardian and
protector, and as such owed her a clear legal duty which he completely
failed to perform.\" The cases cited and digested establish that no such
legal duty is created based upon a mere moral obligation. The fact that
this woman was in his house created no such legal duty as exists in law
and is due from a husband towards his wife, as seems to be intimated by
the prosecutor\'s brief. Such an inference would be very repugnant to
our moral sense. Respondent had assumed either in fact or by implication
no care or control over his companion. Had this been a case where two
men under like *circumstances* had voluntarily gone on a debauch
together and one had attempted suicide, no one would claim that this
doctrine of legal duty could be invoked to hold the other criminally
responsible for omitting to make effort to rescue his companion. How can
the fact that in this case one of the parties was a woman, change the
principle of law applicable to it? Deriving and applying the law in this
case from the principle of decided cases, we do not find that such legal
duty as is contended for existed in fact or by implication on the part
of respondent towards the deceased, the omission of which involved
criminal liability. We find no more apt words to apply to this case than
those used by Mr. Justice Field in United States v. Knowles, supra.

> \"In the absence of such obligations, it is undoubtedly the moral duty
> of every person to extend to others assistance when in danger; \* \*
> \* and if such efforts should be omitted by any one when they could be
> made without imperiling his own life, he would, by his conduct, draw
> upon himself the just censure and reproach of good men; but this is
> the only punishment to which he would be subjected by society.\"

**\[ ... \]** The conviction is set aside, and respondent is ordered
discharged.

\[excerpted\]

OPINION OF THE COURT

Chief Judge Kaye.

Over the course of several days, three-year-old Shanaya Jones was beaten
to death by her father. Defendant, the child's stepmother, witnessed
most of the violence, but did not alert the authorities or summon
medical assistance until Shanaya was dead. The issue before us is
whether the Grand Jury that indicted defendant for endangering the
welfare of a child had sufficient evidence that defendant was "legally
charged" with the care of Shanaya (Penal Law § 260.10 \[2\]). We
conclude that it did, because the evidence supported an inference that
defendant was acting as the functional equivalent of Shanaya's parent at
the relevant time.

According to evidence presented to the Grand Jury, Shanaya Jones on
August 6, 1996 began an extended visit with her father and defendant,
his wife. Defendant described herself, during Shanaya's visits, as the
child's "mother," "stepmother" and "primary caretaker." Between August
14 and 16, Shanaya's father repeatedly punched the child, threw her into
a wall and pushed her onto the floor, apparently because she would not
eat. While defendant witnessed her husband inflict most of these
beatings and was aware that the child had stopped eating, she did not
seek medical attention until late in the evening of August 16, when
Shanaya was brought by ambulance to a hospital emergency room. By the
time the child arrived at the hospital, she had stopped breathing and
had no pulse. After attempts to revive her were unsuccessful, she was
pronounced dead.

An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was physical abuse sustained
while at defendant's apartment.The Examiner also determined that Shanaya
was starved and dehydrated.

Defendant was charged with endangering the welfare of a child (Penal Law
§ 260.10 \[2\]). Prior to trial, she moved to dismiss the indictment.
Supreme Court granted the motion on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence that defendant was "legally charged" --- the
statutory standard --- with the care or custody of Shanaya. The
Appellate Division reversed for two reasons . First, the court concluded
that because defendant was "legally responsible" for Shanaya's care
under section 1012 (g) of the Family Court Act, she was also "legally
charged" with the child's care under Penal Law § 260.10 (2). Second, the
court held that defendant was criminally liable because she stood in
loco parentis at the time of the crime. We now affirm, solely on the
first ground.

Pursuant to Penal Law § 260.10 (2), "a parent, guardian or other person
legally charged with the care or custody of a child less than eighteen
years old" is guilty of endangering the welfare of a child if he or she
"fails or refuses to exercise reasonable diligence in the control of
such child to prevent \[the child\] from becoming an 'abused child,'.
One of the purposes of this statute is to establish "the duty of one
parent to protect the child from the other parent".

Defendant was not Shanaya's biological mother, legal guardian or
contractually hired caregiver. As for defendant's own statements to
police that she acted as Shanaya's primary caretaker and mother during
Shanaya's visits, defendant argues that they were inadequate to create a
duty because they did not indicate that she had assumed all of the
obligations of motherhood on a permanent basis. Penal Law § 260.10 (2)
specifically includes parents and guardians as people who are subject to
prosecution. In effect, therefore, defendant argues that "other person
legally charged with the care or custody of a child" is limited to
people who have contracted to care for or who stand in loco parentis to
a child. We conclude that the statutory term is not so narrowly
confined.

Because the Penal Law does not describe who constitutes a "person
legally charged with the care or custody of a child," defining this term
falls to the courts. In discharging this responsibility, we are mindful
of the statutory language, the legislative purpose and the Penal Law's
directive that its provisions should be "construed according to the fair
import of their terms to promote justice and effect the objects of the
law" (Penal Law § 5.00). . .

The Family Court Act does not use the term "person legally charged," but
it defines the similar term "person legally responsible" to include "the
child's custodian, guardian \[or\] any other person responsible for the
child's care at the relevant time" (Family Ct Act § 1012 \[g\]). The
Family Court Act further specifies that a "custodian" "may include any
person continually or at regular intervals found in the same household
as the child when the conduct of such person causes or contributes to
the abuse or neglect of the child." This definition was specifically
meant to include "paramours". . .

\[T\]he evidence before the Grand Jury established a prima facie case
that defendant was legally responsible for Shanaya's care under Family
Court Act § 1012 (g), and therefore legally charged with Shanaya's care
under Penal Law § 260.10 (2). . .

By expanding the bounds of who is legally responsible for children
beyond the realm of the traditional family and legal guardian, this
standard takes into account the modern-day reality that parenting
functions are not always performed by a parent. As the case before us
illustrates, a person who is not a child's biological parent can play a
significant role in rearing the child. Defendant acknowledged that
whenever Shanaya visited the apartment she shared with Shanaya's father,
she functioned as the child's mother. At the time of Shanaya's death,
the three year old had spent 10 consecutive days and nights at
defendant's apartment. . .

Defendant insists that she was not legally charged with Shanaya's care
because she could not have been in loco parentis to the child absent a
showing that she intended to support and care for her on a permanent
basis . It is unnecessary for the People to prove that defendant assumed
parental duties on a full-time basis, however, because "whether a person
stands in loco parentis to a child is a separate inquiry from whether
such a person acts as the functional equivalent of a parent" . A person
may act as the functional equivalent of a parent even though that person
assumes only temporary care or custody of the child, so long as the
circumstances of the case otherwise warrant such a determination, as
they appear to here. This conclusion comports with the requirement that
a "person legally responsible" need only be responsible for the child's
care "at the relevant time" (Family Ct Act § 1012 \[g\]). . .

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division \[to not dismiss the
indictment\] should be affirmed.

Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur; Judge
Levine taking no part.

Order affirmed.

Regina v. Cunningham

 

 **REGINA v. CUNNINGHAM.**

**\[ ... \]**

BYRNE J. read the following judgment. The appellant was convicted at
Leeds Assizes upon an indictment framed under section 23 of the Offences
against the Person Act, 1861, which charged that he unlawfully and
maliciously caused to be taken by Sarah Wade a certain noxious thing,
namely, coal gas, so as thereby to endanger the life of the said Sarah
Wade.

The facts were that the appellant was engaged to be married and his
prospective mother-­in-law was the tenant of a house, No. 7A, Bakes
Street, Bradford, which was unoccupied, but which was to be occupied by
the appellant after his marriage. Mrs. Wade and her husband, an elderly
couple, lived in the house next door. At one time the two houses had
been one, but when the building was converted into two houses a wall had
been erected to divide the cellars of the two houses, and that wall was
composed of rubble loosely cemented.

On the evening of January 17, 1957, the appellant went the cellar of No.
7A, Bakes Street, wrenched the gas meter from the gas pipes and stole
it, together with its contents, and in a second indictment he was
charged with the larceny of the gas meter and its contents. To that
indictment he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months
imprisonment. In respect of that matter he does not appeal.

The facts were not really in dispute, and in a statement to a police
officer the appellant said: "All right, I will tell you. I was short of
money, I had been off work for three days, I got eight shillings from
the gas meter. I tore it the wall and threw it away.\" Although there
was a stop tap within two feet of the meter the appellant did not turn
off the gas, with the result that a very considerable volume of gas
escaped, some of which seeped through the wall of the cellar and
partially asphyxiated Mrs. Wade, who was asleep in her bedroom next
door, with the result that her life was endangered.

At the close of the case for the prosecution, Mr. Brodie, who appeared
for the appellant at the trial and who has appeared for him again in
this court submitted that there was no case to go to the jury, but the
judge, quite rightly in our opinion, rejected this submission. The
appellant did not give evidence.

The act of the appellant was clearly unlawful and therefore the real
question for the jury was whether it was also malicious within the
meaning of section 23 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.

Before this court Mr. Brodie has taken three points, all dependent upon
the construction of that section. Section 23 provides:

> "Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously administer to or cause to
> be administered to or taken by any other person any poison or other
> destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger the life of
> such person, or so as thereby to inflict upon such person any grievous
> bodily harm, shall be guilty of felony . . ."

Mr. Brodie argued, first, that mens rea of some kind is necessary.
Secondly, that the nature of the mens rea required is that the appellant
must intend to do the particular kind of harm that was done, or,
alternatively, that he must foresee that that harm may occur yet
nevertheless continue recklessly to do the act. Thirdly, that the judge
misdirected the jury as to the meaning of the word \"maliciously." He
cited the following cases: *Reg. v.
Pembliton*[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X8444b94c1cb9708703fb5eb51e470a2cb6b4aaf),
*Reg. v.
Latimer*[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X78424b903fd905b6e8fa420997147f1a7bd97d9)
and *Reg v.
Faulkner*[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xf59dcc023fb097797a07b0b0701c7fc7d392c63).
In reply, Mr. Snowden, on behalf of the Crown, cited *Reg. v.
Martin*.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X85873578214dd1d58bb804935a6d93c28a06b6f)

We have considered those cases, and we have also considered, in the
light of those cases, the following principle which was propounded by
the late Professor C. S. Kenny in the first edition of his Outlines of
Criminal Law published in 1902 and repeated at p. 186 of the 16th
edition edited by Mr. J. W. Cecil Turner and published in 1952:

> "In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in
> the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either
> (1) An actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact
> was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or
> not (i.e., the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm
> might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It
> is neither limited to nor does it indeed require any ill will
> towards the person injured.\"

 

**\[ ... \]**

We think that this is an accurate statement of the law. **\[ ... \]** In
our opinion the word maliciously in a statutory crime postulates
foresight of consequence.

In his summing-up Oliver J. directed the jury as follows:

> "You will observe that there is nothing there about \'with intention
> that that person should take it.\' He has not got to intend that it
> should be taken; it is sufficient that by his unlawful and malicious
> act he causes it to be taken. What you have to decide here, then, is
> whether, when he loosed that frightful cloud of coal gas into the
> house which he shared with this old lady, he caused her to take it by
> his unlawful and malicious action. \'Unlawful\' does not need any
> definition. It is something forbidden by law. What about
> \'malicious\'? \'Malicious\' for this purpose means wicked \--
> something which he has no business to do and perfectly well knows it.
> \'Wicked\' is as good a definition as any other which you would get."
>
> "The facts which face you (and they are uncontradicted and undisputed;
> the prisoner has not gone into the box to seek to give any particular
> explanation) are these. Living in the house, which was now two houses
> but which had once been one and had been rather roughly divided, the
> prisoner quite deliberately, intending to steal the money that was in

> thus released the mains supply of gas at large into that house. When
> he did that he knew that this old lady and her husband were living
> next door to him. The gas meter was in a cellar. The wall which
> divided his cellar from the cellar next door was a kind of honeycomb
> wall through which gas could very well go, so that when he loosed that

> should have left it to you to decide, and I should have told you that
> there was evidence on which you could find that he "intended that,
> since he did an action which he must have known would result in that.
> As I have already told you, it is not necessary to prove that he

> unlawfully and maliciously.\"

 

With the utmost respect to the learned judge, we think it is incorrect
to say that the word \"malicious\" in a statutory offence merely means
wicked. We think the judge was, in effect, telling the jury that if they
were satisfied that the appellant acted wickedly - and he had clearly
acted wickedly in stealing the gas meter and its contents - they ought
to find that he had acted maliciously in causing the gas to be taken by
Mrs. Wade so as thereby to endanger her life.

In our view it should have been left to the jury to decide whether, even
if the appellant did not intend the injury to Mrs. Wade, he foresaw that
the removal of the gas meter might cause injury to someone but
nevertheless removed it. We are unable to say that a reasonable jury,
properly directed as to the meaning of the word maliciously in the
context of section 23, would without doubt have convicted.

In these circumstances this court has no alternative but to allow the
appeal and quash the conviction.

State v Hazelwood

 

### *State v. Hazelwood*

Alaska Supreme Court\
\
946 P.2d 875 (Alaska 1997)

 

RABINOWITZ, Justice.

Respondent\'s conviction stems from the [Exxon Valdez
incident.](https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/exxon-valdez-oil-spill)**\***
On March 24, 1989, Captain Joseph Hazelwood ran his ship aground off
Bligh Reef and reported he was \"evidently leaking some oil.\"
Eventually, eleven million gallons poured into Prince William Sound. A
jury subsequently convicted Hazelwood of negligent discharge of oil.

The difference between criminal and civil negligence although not major
is distinct. Under both standards, a person acts \"negligently\" when he
fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a particular
result will occur.

The two tests part ways in their descriptions of the relevant unobserved
risk. Under ordinary negligence, \"the risk must be of such a nature and
degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a deviation from the
standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the
situation.\". Criminal negligence requires a greater risk. This standard
is met only when the risk is of such a nature and degree that the
failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard
of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.
Criminal negligence is something more than the slight degree of
negligence necessary to support a civil action for damages and is
negligence of a degree so gross as to be deserving of punishment.

In essence, then, the criminal negligence standard requires the jury to
find negligence so gross as to merit not just damages but also
punishment. It does not spill over into recklessness; there is still no
requirement that the defendant actually be aware of the risk of harm.
However, criminal negligence does require a more culpable mental state
than simple, ordinary negligence.

The statute under which Hazelwood was convicted provides in relevant
part:

A person may not discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the
discharge of petroleum \... into, or upon the waters or land of the
state except in quantities, and at times and locations or under
circumstances and conditions as the department may by regulation
permit\....

Former AS 46.03.790(a) (current AS 46.03.740). At the time of the
alleged crime, a person who \"negligently\" violated this provision was
guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

The Court of Appeals concluded that the unadorned use of the word
\"negligently\" created an ambiguity as to whether the statute rests on
criminal or ordinary negligence. Relying on its past decisions, the
court held that criminal liability may be imposed on the basis of simple
or ordinary negligence \"only for offenses dealing with heavily
regulated activities for which permits or licenses are required.\"

An appropriate place to begin an explanation for objective fault crimes
is with the objections of those who would abolish them altogether. In
Jerome Hall, *Negligent Behavior Should Be Excluded from Penal
Liability*, 63 Colo. L.Rev. 632 (1963), Professor Hall challenges the
alleged utility of sanctions based on negligence and strict liability.
He contends crimes that are not based on subjective awareness of
wrongdoing are, by their terms, not addressed to \"the extremely
important degree of individual freedom, autonomy, and awareness \...
expressed in (voluntary) action by a normal adult.\" Merely negligent
harm doers, contends Professor Hall, \"have not in the least thought of
their duty, their dangerous behavior, or any sanction.\"

The difficulty with this thesis is that it assumes legal regulations can
operate only through the offender\'s conscious reason. A rebuttal is
supplied by Professor Hart:

\[T\]he connexion between the threat of punishment and subsequent good
behavior is not \[always\] of the rationalistic kind pictured in the
guiding-type of case. The threat of punishment is something which causes
\[the offender\] to exert his faculties, rather than something which
enters as a reason for conforming to the law when he is deliberating
whether to break it or not. It is perhaps more like a goad than a guide.
But there seems to me to be nothing disreputable in allowing the law to
function in this way, and it is arguable that it functions in this way
rather than in the rationalistic way more frequently than is generally
allowed.

H.L.A. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility 134 (1968).

The law\'s \"goad,\" rather than its guide, is also emphasized by
Professor LaFave. He asks whether more than civil negligence should be
required for a criminal offense, and concludes \"that there is no need
to choose one answer for all crimes.\" His primary focus is on
deterrence:

The principal policy question is whether the threat of punishment for
objective fault will deter people from conducting themselves in such a
way as to create risk to others. Though the matter is disputed, it would
seem that some people can be made to think, before they act, about the
possible consequences of acting, so that the existence of
objective-fault crimes does tend to reduce risky conduct\... The point
is that the legislature might, in the exercise of its police power,
require subjective fault for some crimes and objective fault for other
crimes.

1 LaFave at 337-38 (footnotes omitted).

It is here, grounded in a theory of reasonable deterrence, that any
explanation for objective fault crimes must have its origins. Despite
Professor Hall\'s challenge, it cannot be disputed that the threat of
punishment necessarily deters. Even when an offender does not of his own
accord realize that his conduct is wrongful, he can in many cases be
made to take care. Coercion that causes the offender to pay attention
can serve important social aims that would not be achieved by
proscriptions that only come into effect when the transgressor
recognizes the harm in his or her behavior.

The fulcrum for deciding what level of intent is the absolute minimum
for a particular offense is a question of when an expectation of
individual conformity is reasonable. Due process under Alaska\'s
Constitution requires that social interests be weighed against those of
the individual. While society\'s interest in obtaining compliance with
its regulations is strong, it can never outweigh the individual\'s
interest in freedom from substantial punishment for a violation he or
she could not reasonably have been expected to avoid. The threshold
question, then, is whether the defendant\'s conduct is something which
society could reasonably expect to deter.

The principle of reasonable deterrence allows the imposition of strict
liability in some circumstances. Generally, a separate mental element
need not be proved when the failure to abide by a rule is inherently
unreasonable. This occurs, for instance, where a person\'s conduct is
hedged in by regulation, such that one may readily assume his or her
routine decisions are guided by rules. Thus, strict liability is
permitted for heavily regulated industries. Persons operating in
rule-laden environments, and whose actions have a substantial impact on
public health, safety, or welfare, can reasonably be assumed aware of
their governing codes.

Outside of these strict liability exceptions, though, a separate showing
of simple civil negligence is both necessary and sufficient under
Alaska\'s Constitution. Negligence, rather than gross negligence, is the
minimum, not because we believe it is the necessary element of every
prosecutor\'s case; indeed, all courts have allowed a separate showing
of mental culpability to be dispensed with altogether in some
circumstances. Rather, the negligence standard is constitutionally
permissible because it approximates what the due process guarantee aims
at: an assurance that criminal penalties will be imposed only when the
conduct at issue is something society can reasonably expect to deter.

This desire to differentiate criminal proceedings from civil proceedings
appears to drive the definition of criminal negligence. That standard is
typically characterized as \"something more\" than ordinary negligence.
Thus the only consensus and precision available in the definition of
criminal negligence is that it is not civil negligence.

This fear of tort standards is unfounded. In response to similar
allegations that civil standards do not protect, the Michigan Supreme
Court has noted that \"\[i\]t is just as much a violation of the due
process clause of the Constitution to take property as it is to take the
liberty of a person.\" In other words, the same constitutional clause
which governs the criminal prosecution would also govern a civil
proceeding, and it is undisputed that due process is satisfied by the
negligence standard in that forum.

We are not persuaded that the simple or ordinary civil negligence
standard is inadequate to protect Hazelwood\'s interests. We conclude
that the Superior Court\'s adoption of an ordinary civil negligence mens
rea standard in its instructions to the jury did not constitute a denial
of due process under article I, section 7 of the Alaska Constitution.

COMPTON, Chief Justice, dissenting.

. . . 

It is well established that \"\[m\]ere negligence is insufficient to
justify an award of punitive damages.\" *Johnson & Higgins of Alaska
Inc. v. Blomfield*, 907 P.2d 1371, 1376 (Alaska 1995) (holding that
punitive damages may only be awarded \"where the wrongdoer\'s conduct
can be characterized as outrageous, such as acts done with malice or bad
motives or a reckless indifference to the interests of others.\"). It is
difficult to accept the proposition that an action which cannot form the
basis for a punitive civil award fairly can be sanctioned with
imprisonment. Admittedly, the prohibition of punitive damages for
conduct which is merely negligent has not been constitutionalized.
However, this prohibition provides yet another strong indication that
judicially accepted notions of fairness foreclose the imposition of
explicitly punitive measures for conduct which is negligent under a
civil standard.

Since I cannot accept the proposition that imprisonment is a
fundamentally fair punishment for civil negligence, I cannot support the
court\'s decision to remove all due process barriers to the
criminalization of negligent conduct. Issues of substantive due process
are issues of public policy at their most basic level. I cannot agree
that public policy is served by giving legislators free rein to impose
criminal sanctions upon whatever conduct a jury may find to be
unreasonable.

Statutory Interpretation: Elonis v. United States

 

## ANTHONY DOUGLAS ELONIS, PETITIONER, v. UNITED STATES.

**\[ ... \]**

Supreme Court of the United States.

Argued December 1, 2014.\
Decided June 1, 2015.

**\[ ... \]**

## CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, delivered the opinion of the Court.

Federal law makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce \"any
communication containing any threat . . . to injure the person of
another.\" 18 U. S. C. §875(c). Petitioner was convicted of violating
this provision under instructions that required the jury to find that he
communicated what a reasonable person would regard as a threat. The
question is whether the statute also requires that the defendant be
aware of the threatening nature of the communication**\[ ... \]**.

## I

## A

**\[ ... \]**In May 2010, Elonis\'s wife of nearly seven years left him,
taking with her their two young children. Elonis began \"listening to
more violent music\" and posting self-styled \"rap\" lyrics inspired by
the music. **\[ ... \]**Eventually, Elonis changed the user name on his
Facebook page from his actual name to a rap-style nom de plume, \"Tone
Dougie,\" to distinguish himself from his \"on-line persona.\" ***\[ ...
\]*** The lyrics Elonis posted as \"Tone Dougie\" included graphically
violent language and imagery. This material was often interspersed with
disclaimers that the lyrics were \"fictitious,\" with no intentional
\"resemblance to real persons.\" ***\[ ... \]***Elonis posted an
explanation to another Facebook user that \"I\'m doing this for me. My
writing is therapeutic.\" ***\[ ... \]***(testifying that it \"helps me
to deal with the pain\").

Elonis\'s co-workers and friends viewed the posts in a different light.
Around Halloween of 2010, Elonis posted a photograph of himself and a
co-worker at a \"Halloween Haunt\" event at the amusement park where
they worked. In the photograph, Elonis was holding a toy knife against
his co-worker\'s neck, and in the caption Elonis wrote, \"I wish.\"
***\[ ... \]*** Elonis was not Facebook friends with the co-worker and
did not \"tag\" her, a Facebook feature that would have alerted her to
the posting. ***\[ ... \]***But the chief of park security was a
Facebook \"friend\" of Elonis, saw the photograph, and fired him. **\[
... \]**

In response, Elonis posted a new entry on his Facebook page:

> \"Moles! Didn\'t I tell y\'all I had several? Y\'all sayin\' I had
> access to keys for all the f\*\*\*in\' gates. That I have sinister
> plans for all my friends and must have taken home a couple. Y\'all
> think it\'s too dark and foggy to secure your facility from a man as
> mad as me? You see, even without a paycheck, I\'m still the main
> attraction. Whoever thought the Halloween Haunt could be so
> f\*\*\*in\' scary?\" **\[ ... \]**

This post became the basis for Count One of Elonis\'s subsequent
indictment, threatening park patrons and employees.

Elonis\'s posts frequently included crude, degrading, and violent
material about his soon-to-be ex-wife. Shortly after he was fired,
Elonis posted an adaptation of a satirical sketch that he and his wife
had watched together. ***\[ ... \]***. In the actual sketch, called
\"It\'s Illegal to Say . . .,\" a comedian explains that it is illegal
for a person to say he wishes to kill the President, but not illegal to
explain that it is illegal for him to say that. When Elonis posted the
script of the sketch, however, he substituted his wife for the
President. The posting was part of the basis for Count Two of the
indictment, threatening his wife:

> \"Hi, I\'m Tone Elonis.
>
> Did you know that it\'s illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife?
> . . .
>
> It\'s one of the only sentences that I\'m not allowed to say. . . .

Yet even more illegal to show an illustrated diagram. \[diagram of the
house\]. . . .\" ***\[ ... \]***

The details about the home were accurate**\[ ... \]**. At the bottom of
the post, Elonis included a link to the video of the original skit, and
wrote, \"Art is about pushing limits. I\'m willing to go to jail for my
Constitutional rights. Are you?\" ***\[ ... \]***

After viewing some of Elonis\'s posts, his wife felt \"extremely afraid
for \[her\] life.\"**\[ ... \]** A state court granted her a three-year
protection-from-abuse order against Elonis (essentially, a restraining
order). ***\[ ... \]***Elonis referred to the order in another post on
his \"Tone Dougie\" page, also included in Count Two of the indictment:

> \"Fold up your \[protection-from-abuse order\] and put it in your

>
> Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?
>
> Try to enforce an Order that was improperly granted in the first place

At the bottom of this post was a link to the Wikipedia article on
\"Freedom of speech.\" ***\[ ... \]***Elonis\'s reference to the police
was the basis for Count Three of his indictment, threatening law
enforcement officers.

That same month, interspersed with posts about a movie Elonis liked and
observations on a comedian\'s social commentary, *id.,* at 356-358,
Elonis posted an entry that gave rise to Count Four of his indictment:

> \"That\'s it, I\'ve had about enough
>
> I\'m checking out and making a name for myself Enough elementary
> schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school
> shooting ever imagined And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a
> Kindergarten class
>
> The only question is . . . which one?\"**\[ ... \]**

Meanwhile, park security had informed both local police and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation about Elonis\'s posts, and FBI Agent Denise
Stevens had created a Facebook account to monitor his online
activity.**\[ ... \]** After the post about a school shooting, Agent
Stevens and her partner visited Elonis at his house**\[ ... \]**.
Following their visit, during which Elonis was polite but uncooperative,
Elonis posted another entry on his Facebook page, called \"Little Agent
Lady,\" which led to Count Five:

> \"You know your s\*\*\*\'s ridiculous when you have the FBI knockin\'

**\[ ... \]**indicted Elonis for making threats to injure patrons and
employees of the park, his estranged wife, police officers, a
kindergarten class, and an FBI agent, all in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§875(c). **\[ ... \]** At trial, Elonis testified that his posts
emulated the rap lyrics of the well-known performer Eminem, some of
which involve fantasies about killing his ex-wife. **\[ ... \]**. The
Government presented as witnesses Elonis\'s wife and co-workers, all of
whom said they felt afraid and viewed Elonis\'s posts as serious
threats. See, *e.g., id.,* at 153, 158.

Elonis requested a jury instruction that \"the government must prove
that he intended to communicate a true threat.\" ***\[ ... \]*** The
District Court denied that request. The jury instructions instead
informed the jury that

> \"A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a
> statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a
> reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be
> interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a
> serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take
> the life of an individual.\" ***\[ ... \]***

The Government\'s closing argument emphasized that it was irrelevant
whether Elonis intended the postings to be threats---\"it doesn\'t
matter what he thinks.\" ***\[ ... \]*** A jury convicted Elonis on four
of the five counts against him, acquitting only on the charge of
threatening park patrons and employees.**\[ ... \]** Elonis was
sentenced to three years, eight months\' imprisonment and three years\'
supervised release.

Elonis renewed his challenge to the jury instructions in the Court of
Appeals, contending that the jury should have been required to find that
he intended his posts to be threats. The Court of Appeals disagreed,
holding that the intent required by Section 875(c) is only the intent to
communicate words that the defendant understands, and that a reasonable
person would view as a threat. **\[ ... \]**

## II

## A

An individual who \"transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any
communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat
to injure the person of another\" is guilty of a felony and faces up to
five years\' imprisonment. 18 U. S. C. §875(c). This statute requires
that a communication be transmitted and that the communication contain a
threat. It does not specify that the defendant must have any mental
state with respect to these elements. In particular, it does not
indicate whether the defendant must intend that his communication
contain a threat.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

Congress meant to proscribe a broad class of threats in Section 875(c),
but did not identify what mental state, if any, a defendant must have to
be convicted.

**\[ ... \]**

## B

The fact that the statute does not specify any required mental state,
however, does not mean that none exists. We have repeatedly held that
\"mere omission from a criminal enactment of any mention of criminal
intent\" should not be read \"as dispensing with it.\" *Morissette* v.
*United States,* 342 U. S. 246, 250 (1952). This rule of construction
reflects the basic principle that \"wrongdoing must be conscious to be
criminal.\" *Id.,* at 252. As Justice Jackson explained, this principle
is \"as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in
freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the
normal individual to choose between good and evil.\" *Id.,* at 250. The
\"central thought\" is that a defendant must be \"blameworthy in mind\"
before he can be found guilty, a concept courts have expressed over time
through various terms such as *mens rea,* scienter, malice aforethought,
guilty knowledge, and the like. *Id.*, at 252**\[ ... \]**. We therefore
generally \"interpret\[ \] criminal statutes to include broadly
applicable scienter requirements, even where the statute by its terms
does not contain them.\" *United States* v. *X-Citement Video, Inc.,*
513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994).

This is not to say that a defendant must know that his conduct is
illegal before he may be found guilty. The familiar maxim \"ignorance of
the law is no excuse\" typically holds true. Instead, our cases have
explained that a defendant generally must \"know the facts that make his
conduct fit the definition of the offense,\" *Staples* v. *United
States,* 511 U. S. 600, 608, n. 3 (1994), even if he does not know that
those facts give rise to a crime.

***\[ ... \]***

When interpreting federal criminal statutes that are silent on the
required mental state, we read into the statute \"only that *mens rea*
which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from \`otherwise
innocent conduct.\'\" *Carter* v. *United States,* 530 U. S. 255, 269
(2000) (quoting *X-Citement Video,* 513 U. S., at 72). **\[ ... \]**

## C

Section 875(c), as noted, requires proof that a communication was
transmitted and that it contained a threat. The \"presumption in favor
of a scienter requirement should apply to *each* of the statutory
elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.\" *X-Citement
Video,* 513 U. S., at 72 (emphasis added). The parties agree that a
defendant under Section 875(c) must know that he is transmitting a
communication. But communicating *something* is not what makes the
conduct \"wrongful.\" Here \"the crucial element separating legal
innocence from wrongful conduct\" is the threatening nature of the
communication. *Id.,* at 73. The mental state requirement must therefore
apply to the fact that the communication contains a threat.

Elonis\'s conviction, however, was premised solely on how his posts
would be understood by a reasonable person. Such a \"reasonable person\"
standard is a familiar feature of civil liability in tort law, but is
inconsistent with \"the conventional requirement for criminal conduct---
*awareness* of some wrongdoing.\" *Staples,* 511 U. S., at 606-607
(quoting *United States* v. *Dotterweich,* 320 U. S. 277, 281 (1943);
emphasis added). Having liability turn on whether a \"reasonable
person\" regards the communication as a threat---regardless of what the
defendant thinks--- \"reduces culpability on the all-important element
of the crime to negligence,\" *Jeffries,* 692 F. 3d, at 484 (Sutton, J.,
*dubitante*), and we \"have long been reluctant to infer that a
negligence standard was intended in criminal statutes,\" *Rogers* v.
*United States,* 422 U. S. 35, 47 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring)**\[
... \]**. Under these principles, \"what \[Elonis\] thinks\" does
matter. **\[ ... \]**

The Government is at pains to characterize its position as something
other than a negligence standard**\[ ... \]**: Elonis can be convicted,
the Government contends, if he himself knew the contents and context of
his posts, and a reasonable person would have recognized that the posts
would be read as genuine threats. That is a negligence standard.

**\[ ... \]**

\* \* \*

In light of the foregoing, Elonis\'s conviction cannot stand. The jury
was instructed that the Government need prove only that a reasonable
person would regard Elonis\'s communications as threats, and that was
error. Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the
results of an act without considering the defendant\'s mental state.
That understanding \"took deep and early root in American soil\" and
Congress left it intact here: Under Section 875(c), \"wrongdoing must be
conscious to be criminal.\" *Morissette,* 342 U. S., at 252.

There is no dispute that the mental state requirement in Section 875(c)
is satisfied if the defendant transmits a communication for the purpose
of issuing a threat, or with knowledge that the communication will be
viewed as a threat. **\[ ... \]** In response to a question at oral
argument, Elonis stated that a finding of recklessness would not be
sufficient. See *id.,* at 8-9. Neither Elonis nor the Government has
briefed or argued that point, and we accordingly decline to address it.
**\[ ... \]**

Our holding makes clear that negligence is not sufficient to support a
conviction under Section 875(c), contrary to the view of nine Courts of
Appeals. Pet. for Cert. 17. There was and is no circuit conflict over
the question JUSTICE ALITO and JUSTICE THOMAS would have us
decide---whether recklessness suffices for liability under Section
875(c)**\[ ... \]**

.

We may be \"capable of deciding the recklessness issue,\" *post,* at 2
(opinion of ALITO, J.), but following our usual practice of awaiting a
decision below and hearing from the parties would help ensure that we
decide it correctly.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

*It is so ordered.*

## JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

**\[ ... \]**

The Court holds that the jury instructions in this case were defective
because they required only negligence in conveying a threat. But the
Court refuses to explain what type of intent was necessary. Did the jury
need to find that Elonis had the *purpose* of conveying a true threat?
Was it enough if he *knew* that his words conveyed such a threat? Would
*recklessness* suffice? The Court declines to say. Attorneys and judges
are left to guess.

This will have regrettable consequences. While this Court has the luxury
of choosing its docket, lower courts and juries **\[ ... \]** must
actually decide cases, and this means applying a standard. If purpose or
knowledge is needed and a district court instructs the jury that
recklessness suffices, a defendant may be wrongly convicted. On the
other hand, if recklessness is enough, and the jury is told that
conviction requires proof of more, a guilty defendant may go free. We
granted review in this case to resolve a disagreement among the
Circuits. But the Court has compounded---not clarified---the confusion.

**\[ ... \]**

In my view, the term \"threat\" in §875(c) can fairly be defined as a
statement that is reasonably interpreted as \"an expression of an
intention to inflict evil, injury, or damage on another.\" Webster\'s
Third New International Dictionary 2382 (1976). Conviction under §875(c)
demands proof that the defendant\'s transmission was in fact a threat,
*i.e.,* that it is reasonable to interpret the transmission as an
expression of an intent to harm another. In addition, it must be shown
that the defendant was at least reckless as to whether the transmission
met that requirement.

Why is recklessness enough? My analysis of the *mens rea* issue follows
the same track as the Court\'s, as far as it goes. I agree with the
Court that we should presume that criminal statutes require some sort of
*mens rea* for conviction. **\[ ... \]**

Whether negligence is morally culpable is an interesting philosophical
question, but the answer is at least sufficiently debatable to justify
the presumption that a serious offense against the person that lacks any
clear common-law counterpart should be presumed to require more.

Once we have passed negligence, however, no further presumptions are
defensible. In the hierarchy of mental states that may be required as a
condition for criminal liability, the *mens rea* just above negligence
is recklessness. Negligence requires only that the defendant \"should
\[have\] be\[en\] aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk,\" ALI,
Model Penal Code §2.02(2)(d), p. 226 (1985), while recklessness exists
\"when a person disregards a risk of harm of which he is aware,\"
*Farmer* v. *Brennan,* 511 U. S. 825, 837 (1994); Model Penal Code
§2.02(2)(c). And when Congress does not specify a *mens rea* in a
criminal statute, we have no justification for inferring that anything
more than recklessness is needed. **\[ ... \]**

There can be no real dispute that recklessness regarding a risk of
serious harm is wrongful conduct. **\[ ... \]** Someone who acts
recklessly with respect to conveying a threat necessarily grasps that he
is not engaged in innocent conduct. He is not merely careless. He is
aware that others could regard his statements as a threat, but he
delivers them anyway.

Accordingly, I would hold that a defendant may be convicted under
§875(c) if he or she consciously disregards the risk that the
communication transmitted will be interpreted as a true threat. **\[ ...

Our default rule in favor of general intent applies with full force to
criminal statutes addressing speech. Well over 100 years ago, this Court
considered a conviction under a federal obscenity statute that punished
anyone \"\`who shall knowingly deposit, or cause to be deposited, for
mailing or delivery,\'\" any \"\`obscene, lewd, or lascivious book,
pamphlet, picture, paper, writing, print, or other publication of an
indecent character.\'\" *Rosen* v. *United States,* 161 U. S. 29, 30
(1896) (quoting Rev. Stat. §3893). In that case, as here, the defendant
argued that, even if \"he may have had . . . actual knowledge or notice
of \[the paper\'s\] contents\" when he put it in the mail, he could not
\"be convicted of the offence . . . unless he knew or believed that such
paper could be properly or justly characterized as obscene, lewd, and
lascivious.\" 161 U. S., at 41. The Court rejected that theory,
concluding that if the material was actually obscene and \"deposited in
the mail by one who knew or had notice at the time of its contents, the
offence is complete, although the defendant himself did not regard the
paper as one that the statute forbade to be carried in the mails.\"
*Ibid.* As the Court explained, \"Congress did not intend that the
question as to the character of the paper should depend upon the opinion
or belief of the person who, with knowledge or notice of \[the
paper\'s\] contents, assumed the responsibility of putting it in the
mails of the United States,\" because \"\[e\]very one who uses the mails
of the United States for carrying papers or publications must take
notice of . . . what must be deemed obscene, lewd, and lascivious.\"
*Id.,* at 41-42.

**\[ ... \]**

## B

Applying ordinary rules of statutory construction, I would read §875(c)
to require proof of general intent. To \"know the facts that make his
conduct illegal\" under §875(c), see *Staples,* 511 U. S., at 605, a
defendant must know that he transmitted a communication in interstate or
foreign commerce that contained a threat. Knowing that the communication
contains a \"threat\"---a serious expression of an intention to engage
in unlawful physical violence---does not, however, require knowing that
a jury will conclude that the communication contains a threat as a
matter of law. Instead, like one who mails an \"obscene\" publication
and is prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute, a defendant
prosecuted under §875(c) must know only the words used in that
communication, along with their ordinary meaning in context.

General intent divides those who know the facts constituting the *actus
reus* of this crime from those who do not. **\[ ... \]** A defendant
like Elonis, however, who admits that he \"knew that what \[he\] was
saying was violent\" but supposedly \"just wanted to express
\[him\]self,\" App. 205, acted with the general intent required under
§875(c), even if he did not know that a jury would conclude that his
communication constituted a \"threat\" as a matter of law.

**\[ ... \]**

Requiring general intent in this context is not the same as requiring
mere negligence. **\[ ... \]** In other words, the defendant must
*know*---not merely be reckless or negligent with respect to the
fact---that he is committing the acts that constitute the *actus reus*
of the offense.

But general intent requires *no* mental state (not even a negligent one)
concerning the \"fact\" that certain words meet the *legal* definition
of a threat. That approach is particularly appropriate where, as here,
that legal status is determined by a jury\'s application of the legal
standard of a \"threat\" to the contents of a communication. And
convicting a defendant despite his ignorance of the legal--- or
objective---status of his conduct does not mean that he is being
punished for negligent conduct.**\[ ... \]**

Knowledge & Willful Blindness: United States v. Jewell

 

### *United States v. Jewell*

United States Court of Appeals

532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir. 1976)

 

It is undisputed that appellant entered the United States driving an
automobile in which 110 pounds of marihuana worth \$6,250 had been
concealed in a secret compartment between the trunk and rear seat.
Appellant testified that he did not know the marihuana was present.
There was circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer that
appellant had positive knowledge of the presence of the marihuana, and
that his contrary testimony was false. On the other hand there was
evidence from which the jury could conclude that appellant spoke the
truth --- that although appellant knew of the presence of the secret
compartment and had knowledge of facts indicating that it contained
marijuana, he deliberately avoided positive knowledge of the presence of
the contraband to avoid responsibility in the event of discovery. If the
jury concluded the latter was indeed the situation, and if positive
knowledge is required to convict, the jury would have no choice
consistent with its oath but to find appellant not guilty even though he
deliberately contrived his lack of positive knowledge. Appellant urges
this view. The trial court rejected the premise that only positive
knowledge would suffice, and properly so.

Appellant tendered an instruction that to return a guilty verdict the
jury must find that the defendant knew he was in possession of
marihuana. The trial judge rejected the instruction because it suggested
that \"absolutely, positively, he has to know that it\'s there.\" The
court said, \"I think, in this case, it\'s not too sound an instruction
because we have evidence that if the jury believes it, they\'d be
justified in finding he actually didn\'t know what it was --- he didn\'t
because he didn\'t want to find it.\"

The court instructed the jury that \"knowingly\" meant voluntarily and
intentionally and not by accident or mistake. The court told the jury
that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant \"knowingly\" brought the marihuana into the United States
(count 1: 21 U.S.C. § 952(a)), and that he \"knowingly\" possessed the
marihuana (Count 2: 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)). The court continued:

The Government can complete their burden of proof by proving, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that if the defendant was not actually aware that
there was marijuana in the vehicle he was driving when he entered the
United States his ignorance in that regard was solely and entirely a
result of his having made a conscious purpose to disregard the nature of
that which was in the vehicle, with a conscious purpose to avoid
learning the truth.

The legal premise of these instructions is firmly supported by leading
commentators here and in England. Professor Rollin M. Perkins writes,
\"One with a deliberate anti-social purpose in mind . . . may
deliberately \'shut his eyes\' to avoid knowing what would otherwise be
obvious to view. In such cases, so far as criminal law is concerned, the
person acts at his peril in this regard, and is treated as having
\'knowledge\' of the facts as they are ultimately discovered to be.\" J.
Ll. J. Edwards, writing in 1954, introduced a survey of English cases
with the statement, \"For well-nigh a hundred years, it has been clear
from the authorities that a person who deliberately shuts his eyes to an
obvious means of knowledge has sufficient *mens rea* for an offence
based on such words as . . . \'knowingly.\'\" Professor Glanville
Williams states, on the basis both English and American authorities,
\"To the requirement of actual knowledge there is one strictly limited
exception. . . . \[T\]he rule is that if a party has his suspicion
aroused but then deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because
he wishes to remain in ignorance, he is deemed to have knowledge."
Professor Williams concludes, \"The rule that wilful blindness is
equivalent to knowledge is essential, and is found throughout the
criminal law.\"

The substantive justification for the rule is that deliberate ignorance
and positive knowledge are equally culpable. The textual justification
is that in common understanding one \"knows\" facts of which he is less
than absolutely certain. To act \"knowingly,\" therefore, is not
necessarily to act only with positive knowledge, but also to act with an
awareness of the high probability of the existence of the fact in
question. When such awareness is present, \"positive\" knowledge is not
required.

This is the analysis adopted in the Model Penal Code. Section 2.02(7)
states: \"When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an
element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is
aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually
believes that it does not exist.\" As the Comment to this provision
explains, \"Paragraph (7) deals with the situation British commentators
have denominated \'wilful blindness\' or \`connivance,\' the case of the
actor who is aware of the probable existence of a material fact but does
not satisfy himself that it does not in fact exist.\"

\"Deliberate ignorance\" instructions have been approved in prosecutions
under criminal statutes prohibiting \"knowing\" conduct by the Courts of
Appeals of the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits. In many other
cases, Courts of Appeals reviewing the sufficiency of evidence have
approved the premise that \"knowingly\" in criminal statutes is not
limited to positive knowledge, but includes the state of mind of one who
does not possess positive knowledge only because he consciously avoided
it. These lines of authority appear unbroken. Neither the dissent nor
the briefs of either party has cited a case holding that such an
instruction is error or that such evidence is not sufficient to
establish \"knowledge.\"

There is no reason to reach a different result under the statute
involved in this case. Doing so would put this court in direct conflict
with Courts of Appeals in two other circuits that have approved
\"deliberate ignorance\" instructions in prosecutions under 21 U.S.C. §
841(a), or its predecessor, 21 U.S.C. § 174. Nothing is cited from the
legislative history of the Drug Control Act indicating that Congress
used the term \"knowingly\" in a sense at odds with prior authority.
Rather, Congress is presumed to have known and adopted the \"cluster of
ideas\" attached to such a familiar term of art. *Morissette v. United
States,* 342 U.S. 246, 263, (1952).

Appellant\'s narrow interpretation of \"knowingly\" is inconsistent with
the Drug Control Act\'s general purpose to deal more effectively \"with
the growing menace of drug abuse in the United States.\" Holding that
this term introduces a requirement of positive knowledge would make
deliberate ignorance a defense. It cannot be doubted that those who
traffic in drugs would make the most of it. This is evident from the
number of appellate decisions reflecting conscious avoidance of positive
knowledge of the presence of contraband --- in the car driven by the
defendant or in which he is a passenger, in the suitcase or package he
carries, in the parcel concealed in his clothing.

It is no answer to say that in such cases the fact finder may infer
positive knowledge. It is probable that many who performed the
transportation function, essential to the drug traffic, can truthfully
testify that they have no *positive* knowledge of the load they carry.
Under appellant\'s interpretation of the statute, such persons will be
convicted only if the fact finder errs in evaluating the credibility of
the witness or deliberately disregards the law.

It begs the question to assert that a \"deliberate ignorance\"
instruction permits the jury to convict without finding that the accused
possessed the knowledge required by the statute. Such an assertion
assumes that the statute requires positive knowledge. But the question
is the meaning of the term \"knowingly\" in the statute. If it means
positive knowledge, then, of course, nothing less will do. But if
\"knowingly\" includes a mental state in which the defendant is aware
that the fact in question is highly probable but consciously avoids
enlightenment, the statute is satisfied by such proof.

It is worth emphasizing that the required state of mind differs from
positive knowledge only so far as necessary to encompass a calculated
effort to avoid the sanctions of the statute while violating its
substance. \"A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it
can almost be said that the defendant actually knew.\" In the language
of the instruction in this case, the government must prove, \"beyond a
reasonable doubt, that if the defendant was not actually aware . . . his
ignorance in that regard was *solely* and *entirely* a result of . . . a
conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.\"

No legitimate interest of an accused is prejudiced by such a standard,
and society\'s interest in a system of criminal law that is enforceable
and that imposes sanctions upon all who are equally culpable requires
it.

The conviction is affirmed.

ANTHONY M. KENNEDY, Circuit Judge, with whom ELY, HUFSTEDLER and
WALLACE, Circuit Judges, join (dissenting).

The approach adopted in section 2.02(7) of the Model Penal Code
clarifies, and, in important ways restricts, the English doctrine:

When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high
probability of  its existence, unless he actually believes that it does
not exist.

This provision requires an awareness of a high probability that a fact
exists, not merely a reckless disregard, or a suspicion followed by a
failure to make further inquiry. It also establishes knowledge as a
matter of subjective belief, an important safeguard against diluting the
guilty state of mind required for conviction. It is important to note
that section 2.02(7) is a *definition* of knowledge, not a substitute
for it; as such, it has been cited with approval by the Supreme Court.

In light of the Model Penal Code\'s definition, the \"conscious
purpose\" jury instruction is defective in three respects. First, it
fails to mention the requirement that Jewell have been aware of a high
probability that a controlled substance was in the car. It is not
culpable to form \"a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth\"
unless one is aware of facts indicating a high probability of that
truth. To illustrate, a child given a gift-wrapped package by his mother
while on vacation in Mexico may form a conscious purpose to take it home
without learning what is inside; yet his state of mind is totally
innocent unless he is aware of a high probability that the package
contains a controlled substance. Thus, a conscious purpose instruction
is only proper when coupled with a requirement that one be aware of a
high probability of the truth.

The second defect in the instruction as given is that it did not alert
the jury that Jewell could not be convicted if he \"actually believed\"
there was no controlled substance in the car. The failure to emphasize,
as does the Model Penal Code, that subjective belief is the
determinative factor, may allow a jury to convict on an objective theory
of knowledge --- that a reasonable man should have inspected the car and
would have discovered what was hidden inside. 

Third, the jury instruction clearly states that Jewell could have been
convicted even if found ignorant or \"not actually aware\" that the car
contained a controlled substance. This is unacceptable because true
ignorance, no matter how unreasonable, cannot provide a basis for
criminal liability when the statute requires knowledge. A proper jury
instruction based on the Model Penal Code would be presented as a way of
defining knowledge, and not as an alternative to it.

Knowledge, Recklessness & Mistake - State v. Nations

 

Missouri Court of Appeals

**State v. Nations**

676 S.W.2d 282

No. 45349

1984-08-28

SATZ, Judge.

Defendant, Sandra Nations, owns and operates the Main Street Disco, in
which police officers found a scantily clad sixteen year old girl
"dancing" for "tips". Consequently, defendant was charged with
endangering the welfare of a child "less than seventeen years old," §
568.050 RSMo
1978.[^1^](../../../resources/11-state-v-nations/annotate/#footnote_1_1)
Defendant was convicted and fined \$1,000.00. Defendant appeals. We
reverse. . .

Specifically, defendant argues the state failed to show she knew the
child was under seventeen and, therefore, failed to show she had the
requisite intent to endanger the welfare of a child "less than seventeen
years old." We agree.

The pertinent part of § 568.050 provides:

"1. A person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a child if:

\(2\) He knowingly encourages, aids or causes a child less than
seventeen years old to engage in any conduct which causes or tends to
cause the child to come within the provisions of subdivision (l)(c) ..
of section 211.031, RSMo \...."

-   568.050 requires the state to prove the defendant "knowingly"
    encouraged a child "less than seventeen years old" to engage in
    conduct tending to injure the child's welfare, and "knowing" the
    child to be less than seventeen is a material element of the crime.
    *See* § 562.021.

"Knowingly" is a term of art, whose meaning is limited to the definition
given to it by our present Criminal Code. Literally read, the Code
defines "knowingly" as actual knowledge --- "A person *'acts
knowingly',* or with knowledge, (1) with respect \... to attendant
circumstances when he is aware \... that those circumstances exist \_"
(Emphasis original). §
562.016.3.[^4^](../../../resources/11-state-v-nations/annotate/#footnote_1_4)
So read, this definition of "knowingly" or "knowledge" excludes those
cases in which "the fact \[in issue\] would have been known had not the
person wilfully 'shut his eyes' in order to avoid knowing." Perkins,
*Criminal Law* 942 (2d ed. 1969). The Model Penal Code, the source of
our Criminal Code, does not ex-elude these cases from its definition of
"knowingly". Instead, the Model Penal Code proposes that "\[w\]hen
knowledge of the *existence of a particular fact* is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high
probability of its existence\_" (Emphasis added). Model Penal Code §
2.02(7) (Proposed Official Draft 1962). This definition sounds more like
a restatement of the definition of "recklessly" than
"knowingly".[^5^](../../../resources/11-state-v-nations/annotate/#footnote_1_5)
The similarity is intentional. The Model Penal Code simply proposes that
wilful blindness to a fact "be viewed as one of acting knowingly when
what is involved is a matter of existing fact, but not when what is
involved is the result of the defendant's conduct, necessarily a matter
of the future at the time of acting."
[^6^](../../../resources/11-state-v-nations/annotate/#footnote_1_6)
Thus, as noted, the Model Penal Code proposes that "\[w\]hen knowledge
of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such
knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of
its existence Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) (Proposed Official Draft 1962).

Our legislature, however, did not enact this proposed definition of
"knowingly". Although the definitions of "knowingly" and "recklessly" in
our Criminal Code are almost identical to the primary definitions of
these terms as proposed in the Model Penal Code, *see* Model Penal Code
§ 2.02(2)(b)-(c) (Proposed Official Draft 1962), the Model Penal Code's
proposed expanded definition of "knowingly", encompassing wilful
blindness of a fact, is absent from our Criminal Code. The sensible, if
not compelling, inference is that our legislature rejected the expansion
of the definition of "knowingly" to include wilful blindness of a fact
and chose to limit the definition of "knowingly" to actual knowledge of
the
fact.[^7^](../../../resources/11-state-v-nations/annotate/#footnote_1_7)
Thus, in the instant case, the state's burden was to show defendant
actually was aware the child was under seventeen, a heavier burden than
showing there was a "high probability" that defendant was aware the
child was under seventeen. In short, the state's burden was to prove
defendant acted "knowingly", not just "recklessly". The state proved,
however, that defendant acted "recklessly", not "knowingly". This we
conclude from our review of the record. . .

The record shows that, at the time of the incident, the child was
sixteen years old. When the police arrived, the child was "dancing" on
stage for "tips" with another female. The police watched her dance for
some five to seven minutes before approaching defendant in the service
area of the bar. Believing that one of the girls appeared to be "young,"
the police questioned defendant about the child's age. Defendant told
them that both girls were of legal age and that she had checked the
girls' identification when she hired them. When the police questioned
the child, she initially stated that she was eighteen but later admitted
that she was only sixteen. She had no identification. . .

These facts simply show defendant was untruthful. Defendant could not
have checked the child's identification, because the child had no
identification with her that day, the first day defendant "hired" the
child. This does not prove that defendant knew the child was less than
seventeen years old. At best, it proves defendant did not know or
refused to learn the✎ child's age. The latter is the best case for the
state. But defendant's refusal to learn the age of this "young" child
who was "dancing" "scantily clad" in her disco bar simply proves that
defendant was "aware of a high probability" that the child was under
seventeen, or, stated otherwise, in the definitional language of our
Criminal Code, proves that defendant was conscious of "a substantial and
unjustifiable risk" that the child was under seventeen and that
defendant's disregard of the risk was a "gross deviation" from the norm.
*See* § 562.016.-4. This, however, is not "knowledge" under our Criminal
Code. It is "recklessness", nothing more. Having failed to prove
defendant knew the child's age was less than seventeen, the state failed
to make a submissible
case.[^9^](../../../resources/11-state-v-nations/annotate/#footnote_1_9)

Judgment reversed.

Admittedly, a person in defendant's shoes can easily avoid conviction of
a crime under § 568.-050 by simply refusing to check the age of
"dancers\". This result is to be rectified, however, by the legislature,
not by judicial redefinition of already precisely defined statutory
language or by improper inferences from operative facts. . .

Other states protect their minor children by the simple device of
removing the requirement of \"knowledge" of the child's age as an
element of the offense. Thus, the New York Penal Code provides:

\"Notwithstanding the use of the term 'knowingly' in any provision of
this chapter defining an offense in which the age of a child is an
element thereof, knowledge by the defendant of the age of such child is
not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless expressly so
provided, a defense to a prosecution therefor that the defendant did not
know the age of the child or believed such age to be the same as or
greater than that specified in the statute." N.Y.Penal Law, § 15.20.3
(McKinney 1975).

Recklessness: People v. Hall

 

### *People v. Hall*

Colorado Supreme Court

999 P.2d 207 (Colo. 2000)

 

Justice BENDER delivered the Opinion of the Court.

**I. INTRODUCTION**

We hold that Nathan Hall must stand trial for the crime of reckless
manslaughter. While skiing on Vail mountain, Hall flew off of a knoll
and collided with Allen Cobb, who was traversing the slope below Hall.
Cobb sustained traumatic brain injuries and died as a result of the
collision. . .

\[Godsoe note: this is the procedural posture, as opposed to the more
usual post-conviction appeal\]:

At a preliminary hearing to determine whether there was probable cause
for the felony count, the county court found that Hall\'s conduct "did
not rise to the level of dangerousness" required under Colorado law to
uphold a conviction for manslaughter, and the court dismissed the
charges.

The charge of reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly
cause \[ \] the death of another person." § 18--3--104(1)(a), 6 C.R.S.
(1999). For his conduct to be reckless, the actor must have consciously
disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death could result
from his actions. See § 18--1--501(8). We hold that, for the purpose of
determining whether a person acted recklessly, a particular result does
not have to be more likely than not to occur for the risk to be
substantial and unjustifiable. A risk must be assessed by reviewing the
particular facts of the individual case and weighing the likelihood of
harm and the degree of harm that would result if it occurs. Whether an
actor consciously disregarded such a risk may be inferred from
circumstances such as the actor\'s knowledge and experience, or from
what a similarly situated reasonable person would have understood about
the risk under the particular circumstances.

**II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

On April 20, 1997, the last day of the ski season, Hall worked as a ski
lift operator on Vail mountain. When he finished his shift and after the
lifts closed, Hall skied down toward the base of the mountain. The
slopes were not crowded.

On the lower part of a run called "Riva Ridge," just below where the
trail intersects with another called "North Face Catwalk," Hall was
skiing very fast, ski tips in the air, his weight back on his skis, with
his arms out to his sides to maintain balance. He flew off of a knoll
and saw people below him, but he was unable to stop or gain control
because of the moguls.

Hall then collided with Cobb, who had been traversing the slope below
Hall. The collision caused major head and brain injuries to Cobb,
killing him. Cobb was taken to Vail Valley Medical Center, where efforts
to resuscitate him failed. Hall\'s blood alcohol level was .009, which
is less than the limit for driving while ability impaired. A test of
Hall\'s blood for illegal drugs was negative. . .

 

**III. DISCUSSION**

**B. Manslaughter and Recklessness**

As Colorado\'s criminal code defines recklessness, "A person acts
recklessly when he consciously disregards a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or that circumstance
exists." § 18--1--501(8). Thus, in the case of manslaughter, the
prosecution must show that the defendant\'s conduct caused the death of
another and that the defendant:

1\) consciously disregarded

2\) a substantial and

3\) unjustifiable risk that he would

4\) cause the death of another.

We examine these elements in detail.

Substantial and Unjustifiable Risk

To show that a person acted recklessly, the prosecution must establish
that the person\'s conduct created a "substantial and unjustifiable"
risk. The district court construed some of our earlier cases as
requiring that the risk of death be "at least more likely than not" to
constitute a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death. In
interpreting our cases, the court relied on an erroneous definition of a
"substantial and unjustifiable" risk. Whether a risk is substantial must
be determined by assessing both the likelihood that harm will occur and
the magnitude of the harm should it occur. We hold that whether a risk
is unjustifiable must be determined by assessing the nature and purpose
of the actor\'s conduct relative to how substantial the risk is. . . 

A risk does not have to be "more likely than not to occur" or "probable"
in order to be substantial. A risk may be substantial even if the chance
that the harm will occur is well below fifty percent. Some risks may be
substantial even if they carry a low degree of probability because the
magnitude of the harm is potentially great. For example, if a person
holds a revolver with a single bullet in one of the chambers, points the
gun at another\'s head and pulls the trigger, then the risk of death is
substantial even though the odds that death will result are no better
than one in six. ....

Whether a risk is substantial is a matter of fact that will depend on
the specific circumstances of each case. Some conduct almost always
carries a substantial risk of death, such as engaging another person in
a fight with a deadly weapon or firing a gun at another. In such
instances, the substantiality of the risk may be evident from the nature
of the defendant\'s conduct and the court will not have to examine the
specific facts in detail. . .

A court cannot generically characterize the actor\'s conduct (e.g.,
"driving a truck") in a manner that ignores the specific elements of the
conduct that create a risk (e.g., driving a truck with failing brakes on
a highway). For example, "installing a heater" carries little risk under
normal circumstances. However, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that
improperly wiring a 120--volt heater to a 240--volt circuit, failing to
use a lock nut to connect the heater to the circuit breaker, and using
other faulty installation techniques creates a substantial risk of
"catastrophic fire" and death. Thus, to determine whether the conduct
created a substantial risk of death, a court must inquire beyond the
general nature of the defendant\'s conduct and consider the specific
conduct in which the defendant engaged.

As well as being substantial, a risk must be unjustifiable in order for
a person\'s conduct to be reckless. Whether a risk is justifiable is
determined by weighing the nature and purpose of the actor\'s conduct
against the risk created by that conduct. If a person consciously
disregards a substantial risk of death but does so in order to advance
an interest that justifies such a risk, the conduct is not reckless. For
example, if a surgeon performs an operation on a patient that has a
seventy-five percent chance of killing the patient, but the patient will
certainly die without the operation, then the conduct is justified and
thus not reckless even though the risk is substantial. . .

Conscious Disregard

In addition to showing that a person created a substantial and
unjustifiable risk, the prosecution must demonstrate that the actor
"consciously disregarded" the risk in order to prove that she acted
recklessly. A person acts with a conscious disregard of the risk created
by her conduct when she is aware of the risk and chooses to act despite
that risk. The statutory definitions of culpable mental states make
these distinctions clear.

Although recklessness is a less culpable mental state than intentionally
or knowingly, it involves a higher level of culpability than criminal
negligence. Criminal negligence requires that, "through a gross
deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would
exercise," the actor fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that a result will occur or a circumstance exists. § 18--1--501(3).
An actor is criminally negligent when he should have been aware of the
risk but was not, while recklessness requires that the defendant
actually be aware of the risk but disregard it. Thus, even if she should
be, a person who is not actually aware that her conduct creates a
substantial and unjustifiable risk is not acting recklessly.

A court or trier of fact may infer a person\'s subjective awareness of a
risk from the particular facts of a case, including the person\'s
particular knowledge or expertise. For example, a court may infer a
person\'s subjective awareness of the risks created by firing a gun from
the facts that the person served an extended tour of duty in the
military as a rifleman and machine gunner and was instructed by both the
army and his father not to point a gun at another person. A court may
infer from a person\'s extensive training and safety instruction that
the person understood the risks of fire and other "catastrophic dangers"
created by the "slipshod" installation of a baseboard heater.

In addition to the actor\'s knowledge and experience, a court may infer
the actor\'s subjective awareness of a risk from what a reasonable
person would have understood under the circumstances. When a court
infers the defendant\'s subjective awareness of a risk from what a
reasonable person in the circumstances would have known, the court may
consider the perspective of a reasonable person in the situation and
with the knowledge and training of the actor. Although a court can infer
what the defendant actually knew based on what a reasonable person would
have known in the circumstances, a court must not confuse what a
reasonable person would have known in the circumstances with what the
defendant actually knew. Thus, if a defendant engaged in conduct that a
reasonable person would have understood as creating a substantial and
unjustifiable risk of death, the court may infer that the defendant was
subjectively aware of that risk, but the court cannot hold the defendant
responsible if she were actually unaware of a risk that a reasonable
person would have perceived.

Hence, in a reckless manslaughter case, the prosecution must prove that
the defendant acted despite his subjective awareness of a substantial
and unjustifiable risk of death from his conduct. Because absent an
admission by the defendant such awareness cannot be proven directly, the
court or trier of fact may infer the defendant\'s awareness of the risk
from circumstances such as the defendant\'s training, knowledge, and
prior experiences, or from what a reasonable person would have
understood under the circumstances.

Risk of Death

The final element of recklessness requires that the actor consciously
disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk of a particular result,
and in the case of manslaughter the actor must risk causing death to
another person. The risk can be a risk of death to another generally;
the actor does not have to risk death to a specific individual. . .

**IV. APPLICATION OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO HALL\'S CONDUCT**

We first ask whether the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to
show that Hall\'s conduct created a substantial and unjustifiable risk
of death. Like other activities that generally do not involve a
substantial risk of death, such as driving a car or installing a heater,
"skiing too fast for the conditions" is not widely considered behavior
that constitutes a high degree of risk. However, we hold that the
specific facts in this case support a reasonable inference that Hall
created a substantial and unjustifiable risk that he would cause
another\'s death.

Several witnesses stated that Hall was skiing very fast. Allen and the
other eyewitnesses all said that Hall was travelling too fast for the
conditions, at an excessive rate of speed, and that he was out of
control. Allen said that Hall passed him on the slope travelling three
times faster than Allen, himself an expert skier. Sandberg presented
testimony that Hall was a ski racer, indicating that Hall was trained to
attain and ski at much faster speeds than even skilled and experienced
recreational skiers. The witnesses said that Hall was travelling
straight down the slope at such high speeds that, because of his lack of
control, he would not have been able to stop or avoid another person.

In addition to statements of witnesses, the nature of Cobb\'s injuries
and other facts of the collision support the inference that Hall was
skiing at an inordinately high speed when he struck Cobb. As Dr.
Galloway testified, the severe injuries Cobb sustained were consistent
with a person being thrown from a moving automobile during a crash. The
coroner said that although he could not estimate Hall\'s speed from
Cobb\'s injuries, Hall must have been travelling with "a significant
amount of speed" to generate sufficient force to cause a basal skull
fracture and brain injuries like Cobb\'s. Additionally, Hall crashed
through Lemaner\'s skis and poles after he struck Cobb---breaking one of
the poles in half---indicating a very high speed and great deal of
force. Hall came to rest over eighty feet past Cobb\'s body, further
suggesting that Hall was skiing at exceptionally high speeds. Thus,
based on the testimony of the witnesses and the coroner\'s examination
of Cobb\'s body, a reasonable person could conclude that Hall was skiing
at very high speeds, thereby creating a risk of serious injury or death
in the event of a skier-to-skier collision.

In addition to Hall\'s excessive speed, Hall was out of control and
unable to avoid a collision with another person. All the witnesses said
Hall was not traversing the slope and that he was skiing straight down
the fall line. Hall was back on his skis, with his ski tips in the air
and his arms out to his sides to maintain balance. Allen said that Hall
was bounced around by the moguls on the slope rather than skiing in
control and managing the bumps. Hall admitted to Deputy Mossness that he
first saw Cobb when he was airborne and that he was unable to stop when
he saw people below him just before the collision. . .

While skiing ordinarily carries a very low risk of death to other
skiers, a reasonable person could have concluded that Hall\'s excessive
speed, lack of control, and improper technique for skiing bumps
significantly increased both the likelihood that a collision would occur
and the extent of the injuries that might result from such a collision,
including the possibility of death, in the event that a person like Cobb
unwittingly crossed Hall\'s downhill path. McWilliam testified that he
was aware of only two other deaths from skier collisions on Vail
mountain in the past eleven years, but a reasonable person could have
determined that Hall\'s conduct was precisely the type of skiing that
risked this rare result.

We next ask whether a reasonable person could have concluded that
Hall\'s creation of a substantial risk of death was unjustified. To the
extent that Hall\'s extremely fast and unsafe skiing created a risk of
death, Hall was serving no direct interest other than his own enjoyment.
Although the sport often involves high speeds and even moments where a
skier is temporarily out of control, a reasonable person could determine
that the enjoyment of skiing does not justify skiing at the speeds and
with the lack of control Hall exhibited. Thus, a reasonable person could
have found that Hall\'s creation of a substantial risk was
unjustifiable. . .

Hall admitted to Deputy Mossness that as he flew off a knoll, he saw
people below him but was unable to stop; Hall was travelling so fast and
with so little control that he could not possibly have respected his
obligation to avoid skiers below him on the slope. Additionally, Hall
skied in this manner for some time over a considerable distance,
demonstrating that his high speeds and lack of control were not the type
of momentary lapse of control or inherent danger associated with
skiing.  . .

We next ask whether a reasonably prudent person could have entertained
the belief that Hall consciously disregarded that risk. Hall is a
trained ski racer who had been coached about skiing in control and
skiing safely. Further, he was an employee of a ski area and had a great
deal of skiing experience. Hall\'s knowledge and training could give
rise to the reasonable inference that he was aware of the possibility
that by skiing so fast and out of control he might collide with and kill
another skier unless he regained control and slowed down. . . Thus, both
Hall\'s subjective knowledge and the awareness that a reasonable person
with Hall\'s background would have had support the inference that Hall
consciously disregarded the risk he created by acting despite his
awareness of the risk. . .

Notes and Questions \-- Hall & Nations; Mens Rea Review Problems

 

**Hall**

1.  What is the difference in a defendant's mind between the criminal
    negligence standard and a reckless standard? Which one is subjective
    and which one is objective?

2.  What evidence does the court look to as to Hall's awareness, or
    "conscious disregard," of the risk?

 

**Nations** 

1.  How reasonable was Nations\' ignorance regarding the dancers\' age?
    Do you think the statute reduces the harm that prompted the
    statute\'s enactment if only \"actual knowledge\" is criminalized? 

2.  On the other hand, rates of conviction and subsequent incarceration
    would certainly rise if a lesser mens rea would suffice for
    conviction. Is overcarceration a price we are willing to pay
    considering the harm to minors in this context? Are there other
    crimes for which we would (or not) be willing to take such risks?
    How might we balance these divergent policy goals? 

3.  What if Nations asked for the dancer's ID and she showed her one
    saying she was 18. It turns out the ID is fake. Would Nations'
    mistake erase her mens rea for the crime? What if the statute had a
    negligent mens rea, rather than a knowledge one?

**PROBLEM 2**: D is a nurse in a nursing home in an MPC state. After
months of sheltering in place, he decides he can't stand the isolation,
and he attends a wild indoor dance party. Unlike most of the guests, who
didn't wear masks, D wore his mask except when he is kissing someone. D
returns to work the following week, and later tests positive for
Covid-19. Then, a week later, one of D's patients tests positive for the
virus. 

D is charged with **Felony Transmission of a Communicable Disease:**  

A person commits a class "D" felony when the person is reckless as to
whether they have a contagious or infectious disease and exposes an
uninfected person to the contagious or infectious disease acting with a
reckless disregard as to whether the uninfected person contracts the
contagious or infectious disease, and the conduct results in the
uninfected person becoming infected with the contagious or infectious
disease. 

**Which of the following is false, and why?**

1\) D will be found guilty if the failure to recognize the risk he posed
was a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person
would have exercised. 

2\) D will be found guilty if the evidence shows D consciously
disregarded the risk that he had been infected. 

3\) D will be found not guilty if it turns out the patient caught the
virus from someone else.

4\) D will be found not guilty if D had no idea that one could transmit
Covid-19 while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) 

 

**PROBLEM 3:** D robs a bank, and a security guard chases him out,
grabbing the car, and holding onto it as D drives away. D guns the
engine and swerves, trying to frighten the guard into letting go. The
guard falls off and is run over by another car, which kills him
instantly.

In MPC-land, is D guilty of Murder 210.2 or Manslaughter 210.3?

**\[ ... \]**

Mr. Justice Frankfurter

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This was a prosecution **\[ ... \]**charging Buffalo Pharmacal Company,
Inc., and Dotterweich, its president and general,manager, with
violations of **\[ ... \]**the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The
Company, a jobber in drugs, purchased them from their manufacturers and
shipped them, repacked under its own label, in interstate commerce. **\[
... \]**The informations were based on § 301 of that Act (21 U. S. C.
§331), paragraph (a) of which prohibits "The introduction or delivery
for introduction into interstate commerce of any . . . drug . . . that
is adulterated or misbranded." "Any person" violating this provision
is**\[ ... \]** made "guilty of a misdemeanor." Three counts went to the
jury --- two, for shipping misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, and
a third, for so shipping an adulterated drug. The jury disagreed as to
the corporation and found Dotterweich guilty on all three counts. **\[
... \]**

The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the
conviction on the ground that only the corporation was the "person"
subject to prosecution **\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]**

The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was an exertion by Congress of its power
to keep impure and adulterated food and drugs out of the channels of
commerce. By the Act of 1938, Congress extended the range of its control
over illicit and noxious articles and stiffened the penalties for
disobedience. The purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the
lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern
industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these
purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be
treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a
collection of English words. **\[ ... \]** The prosecution to which
Dot-terweich was subjected is based on a now familiar type of
legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means of regulation.
Such legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement for
criminal conduct --- awareness of some wrongdoing. In the interest of
the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person
otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public
danger. *United States* v. *Balint,* 258 U. S. 250. And so it is clear
that shipments like those now in issue are \"punished by the statute if
the article is misbranded \[or adulterated\], and that the article may
be misbranded \[or adulterated\] without any conscious fraud at all. It
was natural enough to throw this risk on shippers with regard to the
identity of their wares . . *United States* v. *Johnson,* 221 U. S. 488,
497-98.

**\[ ... \]**

Hardship there doubtless may be under a statute which thus penalizes the
transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting.
Balancing relative hardships, Congress has preferred to place it upon
those who have at least the opportunity of informing themselves of the
existence of conditions imposed for the protection of consumers before
sharing in illicit commerce, rather than to throw the hazard on the
innocent public who are wholly helpless.

**\[ ... \]**

*Reversed.***\[ ... \]**

Mr. Justice Murphy,

dissenting:

**\[ ... \]** There is no evidence in this case of any personal guilt on
the part of the respondent. There is no proof or claim that he ever knew
of the introduction into commerce of the adulterated drugs in question,
much less that he actively participated in their introduction. Guilt is
imputed to the respondent solely on the basis of his authority and
responsibility as president and general manager of the corporation.

It is a fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence that guilt is
personal and that it ought not lightly to be imputed to a citizen who,
like the respondent, has no evil intention or consciousness of
wrongdoing. **\[ ... \]***\[I\]n* the absence of clear statutory
authorization it is inconsistent with established canons of criminal law
to rest liability on an act in which the accused did not participate and
of which he had no personal knowledge. **\[ ... \]**

Supreme Court of the United States

Argued November 30, 1993

Justice Thomas

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The National Firearms Act makes it unlawful for any person to possess a
machinegun that is not properly registered with the Federal Government.
Petitioner contends that, to convict him under the Act, the Government
should have been required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he
knew the weapon he possessed had the characteristics that brought it
within the statutory definition of a machinegun. We agree and
accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I

The National Firearms Act (Act), 26 U. S. C. §§5801-5872, imposes strict
registration requirements on statutorily defined "firearms." The Act
includes within the term "firearm" a machinegun, § 5845(a)(6), and
further defines a machinegun as "any weapon which shoots,\... or can be
readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without
manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger," § 5845(b). Thus,
any fully automatic weapon is a "firearm" within the meaning of the
Act.[**\[ ... \]**](#X410e5f788a52db87e4a06c2ce01e6e5cdb03bb4)Under the
Act, all firearms must be registered in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record maintained by the Secretary of the
Treasury. § 5841. Section 5861(d) makes it a crime, *punishable* by up
to 10 years in prison, see § 5871, for any person to possess a firearm
that is not properly registered.

Upon executing a search warrant at petitioner's home, local police and
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) recovered,
among other things, an AR-15 rifle. The AR-15 is the civilian version of
the military's M-16 rifle, and is, unless modified, a semiautomatic
weapon. The M-16, in contrast, is a selective fire rifle that allows the
operator, by rotating a selector switch, to choose semiautomatic or
automatic fire. Many M-16 parts are interchangeable with those in the
AR-15 and can be used to convert the AR-15 into an automatic weapon. No
doubt to inhibit such conversions, the AR-15 is manufactured with a
metal stop on its receiver that will prevent an M-16 selector switch, if
installed, from rotating to the fully automatic position. The metal stop
on petitioner's rifle, however, had been filed away, and the rifle had
been assembled with an M-16 selector switch and several other M-16
internal parts, including a hammer, disconnector, and trigger.
Suspecting that the AR-15 had been modified to be capable of fully
automatic fire, BATF agents seized the weapon. Petitioner subsequently
was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered machinegun in
violation of § 5861(d).

At trial, BATF agents testified that when the AR-15 was tested, it fired
more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger. It was undisputed
that the weapon was not registered as required by § 5861(d). Petitioner
testified that the rifle had never fired automatically when it was in
his possession. He insisted that the AR-15 had operated only
semiautomatically, and even then imperfectly, often requiring manual
ejection of the spent casing and chambering of the next round. •
According to petitioner, his alleged ignorance of any automatic firing
capability should have shielded him from criminal liability for his
failure to register the weapon. He requested the District Court to
instruct the jury that, to establish a violation of § 5861(d), the
Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant "knew
that the gun would fire fully automatically." 1 App. to Brief for
Appellant in No. 91-5033 (CA10), p. 42.

The District Court rejected petitioner's proposed instruction and
instead charged the jury as follows:

> "The Government need not prove the defendant knows he's dealing with a
> weapon possessing every last characteristic \[which subjects it\][**\[
> ... \]**](#X8bbce2a19ad36f096fcd010f1c606eb7fd388e7) to the
> regulation. It would be enough to prove he knows that he is dealing
> with a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the likelihood
> of regulation." Tr. 465.

Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to five years' probation and a
\$5,000 fine.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. **\[ ... \]**

II

A

Whether or not § 5861(d) requires proof that a defendant knew of the
characteristics of his weapon that made it a "firearm" under the Act is
a question of statutory construction. **\[ ... \]**

Section 5861(d) is silent concerning the *mens rea* required for a
violation. It states simply that "\[i\]t shall be unlawful for any
person \... to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to
him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U. S.
C. § 5861(d). Nevertheless, silence on this point by itself does not
necessarily suggest that Congress intended to dispense with a
conventional *mens rea* element, which would require that the defendant
know the facts that make his conduct illegal. **\[ ... \]**On the
contrary, we must construe the statute in light of the background rules
of the common law, **\[ ... \]**in which the requirement of some *mens
rea* for a crime is firmly embedded. **\[ ... \]**

Relying on the strength of the traditional rule, we have stated that
offenses that require no *mens rea* generally are disfavored, *Liparota,
supra,* at 426, and have suggested that some indication of congressional
intent, express or implied, is required to dispense with *mens rea* as
an element of a crime. **\[ ... \]**

The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate and
restrict the circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in the
Government's view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning what
we have termed "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses, in which we
have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal liability
through statutes that do not require the defendant to know the facts
that make his conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we have
inferred from silence that Congress did not intend to require proof of
*mens rea* to establish an offense.

**\[ ... \]**

Typically, our cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that
regulate potentially harmful or injurious items. **\[ ... \]**In such
situations, we have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he
is dealing with a dangerous device of a character that places him "in
responsible relation to a public danger," *Dotterweich, supra,* at 281,
he should be alerted to the probability of strict regulation, and we
have assumed that in such cases Congress intended to place the burden on
the defendant to "ascertain at his peril whether \[his conduct\] comes
within the inhibition of the statute." *Balint, supra,* at 254. Thus, we
essentially have relied on the nature of the statute and the particular
character of the items regulated to determine whether congressional
silence concerning the mental element of the offense should be
interpreted as dispensing with conventional *mens rea* requirements. See
generally *Morissette, supra,* at 252-260.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xf19a9276fe046e299d5573c780095e3326b93b9)

B

The Government argues that § 5861(d) defines precisely the sort of
regulatory offense described in *Balint.* In this view, all guns,
whether or not they are statutory "firearms," are dangerous devices that
put gun owners on notice that they must determine at their hazard
whether their weapons come within the scope of the Act. **\[ ... \]**

The Government seeks support for its position from our decision in
*United States* v. *Freed,* 401 U. S. 601 (1971), which involved a
prosecution for possession of unregistered grenades under §
5861(d).[**\[ ... \]**](#X0c80dceb81f727853c43c0d78ce11b145321143) The
defendant knew that the items in his possession were grenades, and we
concluded that § 5861(d) did not require the Government to prove the
defendant also knew that the grenades were unregistered. *Id.,* at 609.
To be sure, in deciding that *mens rea* was not required with respect to
that element of the offense, we *suggested* that the Act "is a
regulatory measure in the interest of the public safety, which may well
be premised on the theory that one would hardly be surprised to learn
that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act." *Ibid.*
Grenades, we explained, "are highly dangerous offensive weapons, no less
dangerous than the narcotics involved in *United States* v. *Balint."
Ibid.* But that reasoning provides little support for dispensing with
*mens rea* in this case.

**\[ ... \]***\[O\]ur* analysis in *Freed* likening the Act to the
public welfare statute in *Balint* rested entirely on the assumption
that the defendant *knew* that he was dealing with hand grenades ---
that is, that he knew he possessed a particularly dangerous type of
weapon (one within the statutory definition of a "firearm"), possession
of which was not entirely "innocent" in and of itself. **\[ ... \]**

In glossing over the distinction between grenades and guns, *the*
Government ignores the particular care we have taken to avoid construing
a statute to dispense with *mens rea* where doing so would "criminalize
a broad range of apparently innocent conduct." *Liparota,* 471 U. S., at
426. In *Liparota,* we considered a statute that made unlawful the
unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps. We determined
that the statute required proof that the defendant knew his possession
of food stamps was unauthorized, largely because dispensing with such a
*mens rea* requirement would have resulted in reading the statute to
outlaw a number of apparently innocent acts. *Ibid.* Our conclusion that
the statute should not be treated as defining a public welfare offense
rested on the commonsense distinction that a "food stamp can hardly be
compared to a hand grenade." *Id.,* at 433.

Neither, in our view, can all guns be compared to hand grenades.
Although the contrast is certainly not as stark as that presented in
*Liparota,* the fact remains that there is a long tradition of
widespread lawful gun ownership by private individuals in this country.
Such a tradition did not apply to the possession of hand grenades in
*Freed* or to the selling of dangerous drugs that we considered in
*Balint.* **\[ ... \]**Guns in general are not "deleterious devices or
products or obnoxious waste materials," *International Minerals,*
*supra,* at 565, that put their owners on notice that they stand "in
responsible relation to a public danger," *Dotterweich,* 320 U. S., at
281.

**\[ ... \]**Even dangerous items can, in some cases, be so commonplace
and generally available that we would not consider them to alert
individuals to the likelihood of strict regulation. As suggested above,
despite their potential for harm, guns generally can be owned in perfect
innocence. Of course, we might surely classify certain categories of
guns --- no doubt including the machineguns, sawed-off shotguns, and
artillery pieces that Congress has subjected to regulation --- as items
the ownership of which would have the same quasi-suspect character we
attributed to owning hand grenades in *Freed.* But precisely because
guns falling outside those categories traditionally have been widely
accepted as lawful possessions, their destructive potential, while
perhaps even greater than that of some items we would classify along
with narcotics and hand grenades, cannot be said to put gun owners
sufficiently on notice of the likelihood of regulation to justify
interpreting § 5861(d) as not requiring proof of knowledge of a weapon's
characteristics.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X2a275b93ada2a126ed63d41c5aa636550132f68)

Roughly 50 percent of American homes contain at least one firearm of
some sort,[**\[ ... \]**](#Xab7dbc9cb51dd2c005a00c5f91526cf8cf02094) and
in the vast majority of States, buying a shotgun or rifle is a simple
transaction that would not alert a person to regulation any more than
would buying a car.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X501c601017743fc57146063248eabf2226b8eef)

**\[ ... \]**

We concur in the Fifth Circuit's conclusion on this point: "It is
unthinkable to us that Congress intended to subject such law-abiding,
well-intentioned citizens to a possible ten-year term of imprisonment if
. . . what they genuinely and reasonably believed was a conventional
semi-automatic \[weapon\] turns out to have worn down into or been
secretly modified to be a fully automatic weapon." *Anderson, supra,* at
1254. As we noted in *Morissette,* the "purpose and obvious effect of
doing away with the requirement of a guilty intent is to ease the
prosecution's path to conviction." 342 U. S., at 263.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X4eb2815b0dcf39070eba4217af211edf8e79413) We are reluctant to
impute that purpose to Congress where, as here, it would mean easing the
path to convicting persons whose conduct would not even alert them to
the probability of strict regulation in the form of a statute such as §
5861(d).

C

The potentially harsh penalty attached to violation of § 5861(d) --- up
to 10 years' imprisonment --- confirms our reading of the Act.
Historically, the penalty imposed under a statute has been a significant
consideration in determining whether the statute should be construed as
dispensing with *mens rea.* Certainly, the cases that first defined the
concept of the public welfare offense almost uniformly involved statutes
that provided for only light penalties such as fines or short jail
sentences, not imprisonment in the state penitentiary. **\[ ... \]**

*\[P\]unishing* a violation as a felony is simply incompatible with the
theory of the public welfare offense. In this view, absent a clear
statement from Congress that *mens rea* is not required, we should not
apply the public welfare offense rationale to interpret any statute
defining a felony offense as dispensing with *mens rea.* But see *United
States* v. *Balint,* 258 U. S. 250 (1922).

We need not adopt such a definitive rule of construction to decide this
case, however. Instead, we note only that where, as here, dispensing
with *mens rea* would require the defendant to have knowledge only of
traditionally lawful conduct, a severe penalty is a further factor
tending to suggest that Congress did not intend to eliminate a *mens
rea* *requirement*. In such a case, the usual presumption that a
defendant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal should
apply.

Ill

In short, we conclude that the background rule of the common law
favoring *mens rea* should govern interpretation of § 5861(d) in this
case. Silence does not suggest that Congress dispensed with *mens rea*
for the element of § 5861(d) at issue here. Thus, to obtain a
conviction, the Government should have been required to prove that
petitioner knew of the features of his AR-15 that brought it within the
scope of the Act.[**\[ ...

**\[ ... \]**

The question before us is not *whether* knowledge of possession is
required, but what level of knowledge suffices: (1) knowledge simply of
possession of the object; (2) knowledge, in addition, that the object is
a dangerous weapon; (3) knowledge, beyond dangerousness, of the
characteristics that render the object subject to regulation, for
example, awareness that the weapon is a machinegun.[**\[ ...

**\[ ... \]**

The Nation's legislators chose to place under a registration requirement
only a very limited class of firearms, those they considered especially
dangerous. The generally "dangerous" character of all guns, the Court
therefore observes, *ante,* at 611-612, did not suffice to give
individuals in Staples' situation cause to inquire about the need for
registration. Cf. *United States* v. *Balint,* 258 U. S. 250 (1922)
(requiring reporting of sale of strictly regulated narcotics, opium and
cocaine). Only the third reading, then, suits the purpose of the *mens
rea* requirement --- to shield people against punishment for apparently
innocent activity.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X94f054023c8af7dc46ca4c6d52f8114309691c0)

**\[ ... \]**

For these reasons, I conclude that conviction under § 5861(d) requires
proof that the defendant knew he possessed not simply a gun, but a
machinegun. **\[ ... \]**

Justice Stevens,

with whom Justice Blackmun joins,

dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

The Court is preoccupied with guns that "generally can be owned in
perfect innocence." *Ante,* at 611. This case, however, involves a
semiautomatic weapon that was readily convertible into a machinegun ---
a weapon that the jury found to be " 'a dangerous device of a type as
would alert one to the likelihood of regulation.'" *Ante,* at 604. These
are not guns "of some sort" that can be found in almost "50 percent of
American homes." *Ante,* at 613-614.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xc3097ecef0455ed52146dfc67975c1cc92cfb22) They are particularly
dangerous --- indeed, a substantial percentage of the unregistered
machineguns now in circulation are converted semiautomatic weapons.[**\[
... \]**](#Xdb92c350e9eb76dde5cdd6cbaae41c68ed85a17)

The question presented is whether the National Firearms Act imposed on
the Government the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only
that the defendant knew he possessed a dangerous device sufficient to
alert him to**\[ ... \]**regulation, but also that he knew it had all
the characteristics of a "firearm" as defined in the statute. **\[ ...
\]**

I

Contrary to the assertion by the Court, the text of the statute does
provide "explicit guidance in this case." Cf. *ante,* at 605. The
relevant section of the Act makes it "unlawful for any person \... to
receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the
National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U. S. C. §
5861(d). Significantly, the section contains no knowledge requirement,
nor does it describe a common-law crime.

**\[ ... \]**Because the offense involved in this case is entirely a
creature of statute, however, "the background rules of the common law,"
cf. *ante,* at 605, do not require a particular construction, and
critically different rules of construction apply. See *Morissette* v.
*United States,* 342 U. S., at 252-260.

In *Morissette,* Justice Jackson outlined one such interpretive rule:

> "Congressional silence as to mental elements in an Act merely adopting
> into federal statutory law a concept of crime already \... well
> defined in common law and statutory interpretation by the states may
> warrant quite contrary inferences than the same silence in creating an
> *offense* new to general law, for whose definition the courts have no
> guidance except the Act." *Id.,* at 262.

Although the lack of an express knowledge requirement in § 5861(d) is
not dispositive, see *United States* v. *United States Gypsum Co.,* 438
U. S. 422, 438 (1978), its absence suggests that Congress did not intend
to require proof that the defendant knew all of the facts that made his
conduct illegal.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe5eb99e95495cce8bf1cbded482bc964cae94a3)

**\[ ... \]**

II

**\[ ... \]**

The National Firearms Act unquestionably is a public welfare statute.
*United States* v. *Freed,* 401 U. S. 601, 609 (1971) (holding that this
statute "is *a regulatory* measure in the interest of the public
safety"). Congress fashioned a legislative scheme to regulate the
commerce and possession of certain types of dangerous devices, including
specific kinds of weapons, to protect the health and welfare of the
citizenry. To enforce this scheme, Congress created criminal penalties
for certain acts and omissions. The text of some of these offenses ---
including the one at issue here--- contains no knowledge requirement.

**\[ ... \]**

Both the Court and Justice Ginsburg erroneously rely upon the
"traditional\]" innocence of gun ownership to find that Congress must
have intended the Government to prove knowledge of all the
characteristics that make a weapon a statutory "firear\[m\]." *Ante,* at
610-612; *ante,* at 621-622 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment). **\[
... \]**As such, the Court instead reaches the rather surprising
conclusion that guns are more analogous to food stamps than to hand
grenades.[^19] Even if one accepts that dubious proposition, the Court
founds it upon a faulty premise: its mischaracterization of the
Government's submission as one contending that *"all guns . . .* are
dangerous devices that put gun owners on notice . . . *Ante,* at 608
(emphasis added).[**\[ ...
\]**](#X00398ce2ebcf5a958001691bd3bf573ef210e85) Accurately identified,
the Government's position presents the question whether guns such as the
one possessed by petitioner " 'are highly dangerous offensive weapons,
no less dangerous than the narcotics' " in *Balint* or the hand grenades
in *Freed,* see *ante,* at 609 (quoting *Freed,* 401 U. S., at
609).[**\[ ... \]**](#Xb9eea2f08c78a86dd108adf411b216c660ff3dc)

Thus, even assuming that the Court is correct that the mere possession
of an ordinary rifle or pistol does not entail sufficient danger to
alert one to the possibility of regulation, that conclusion does not
resolve this case. **\[ ... \]**

The enforcement of public welfare offenses always entails some
possibility of injustice. Congress nevertheless has repeatedly decided
that an overriding public interest in health or safety may outweigh that
risk when a person is dealing with products that are sufficiently
dangerous or deleterious to make it reasonable to presume that he either
knows, or should know, whether those products conform to special
regulatory requirements. The dangerous character of the product is
reasonably presumed to provide sufficient notice of the probability of
regulation to justify strict enforcement against those who are merely
guilty of negligent, rather than willful, misconduct.

V

This case presents no dispute about the dangerous character of
machineguns and sawed-off shotguns. Anyone in possession of such a
weapon is "standing in responsible relation to a public danger." See
*Dotterweich,* 320 U. S., at 281 (citation omitted). In the National
Firearms Act, Congress determined that the serious threat to health and
safety posed by the private ownership of such firearms warranted the
imposition of a duty on the owners of dangerous weapons to determine
whether their possession is lawful. Semiautomatic weapons that are
readily convertible into machineguns are sufficiently dangerous to alert
persons who knowingly possess them to the probability of stringent
public regulation. The jury's finding that petitioner knowingly
possessed "a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the
likelihood of regulation" adequately supports the conviction.

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

MURPHY, Chief Judge.

Maryland's "statutory rape" law prohibiting sexual intercourse with an
underage person is codified in Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Art.
27, § 463, which reads in full:

> "Second degree rape.
>
> \(a\) *What constitutes.* --- A person is guilty of rape in the second
> degree if the person engages in vaginal intercourse with another
> person:
>
> \(1\) By force or threat of force against the will and without the
> consent of the other person; or
>
> \(2\) Who is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically
> helpless, and the person performing the act knows or should reasonably
> know the other person is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated,
> or physically helpless; or
>
> \(3\) Who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the act
> is at least four years older than the victim.
>
> \(b\) *Penalty.* --- Any person violating the provisions of this
> section is guilty of a felony and upon conviction is subject to
> imprisonment for a period of not more than 20 years."

Subsection (a)(3) represents the current version of a statutory
provision dating back to the first comprehensive codification of the
criminal law by the Legislature in 1809.[^20] Now we consider whether
under the present statute, the State must prove that a defendant knew
the complaining witness was younger than 14 and, in a related question,
whether it was error at trial to exclude evidence that he had been told,
and believed, that she was 16 years old.

I

Raymond Lennard Garnett is a young retarded man. At the time of the
incident in question he was 20 years old. He has an I.Q. of 52. His
guidance counselor from the Montgomery County public school system,
Cynthia Parker, described him as a mildly retarded person who read on
the third-grade level, did arithmetic on the 5th-grade level, and
interacted with others socially at school at the level of someone 11 or
12 years of age. Ms. Parker added that Raymond attended special
education classes and for at least one period of time was educated at
home when he was afraid to return to school due to his classmates'
taunting. **\[ ... \]**

In November or December 1990, a friend introduced Raymond to Erica
Frazier, then aged 13; the two subsequently talked occasionally by
telephone. On February 28, 1991, Raymond, apparently wishing to call for
a ride home, approached the girl's house at about nine o'clock in the
evening. Erica opened her bedroom window, through which Raymond entered;
he testified that "she just told me to get a ladder and climb up her
window." The two talked, and later engaged in sexual intercourse.
Raymond left at about 4:30 a.m. the following morning. On November 19,
1991, Erica gave birth to a baby, of which Raymond is the biological
father.

Raymond was tried before the Circuit Court for Montgomery County
(Miller, J.) on one count of second degree rape under § 463(a)(3)
proscribing sexual intercourse between a person under 14 and another at
least four years older than the complainant. At trial, the defense twice
proffered evidence to the effect that Erica herself and her friends had
previously told Raymond that she was 16 years old, and that he had acted
with that belief. The trial court excluded such evidence as immaterial,
explaining:

> "Under 463, the only two requirements as relate to this case are that
> there was vaginal intercourse, \[and\] that \... Ms. Frazier was under
> 14 years of age and that \... Mr. Garnett was at least four years
> older than she.
>
> "In the Court's opinion, consent is no defense to this charge. The
> victim's representation as to her age and the defendant's belief, if
> it existed, that she was not under age, what amounts to what otherwise
> might be termed a good faith defense, is in fact no defense to what
> amount\[s\] to statutory rape.
>
> "It is in the Court's opinion a strict liability offense."

The court found Raymond guilty. It sentenced him to a term of five years
in prison, suspended the sentence and imposed five years of probation,
and ordered that he pay restitution to Erica and the Frazier family.

**\[ ... \]**

The new legislation reformulated the former statutory rape law by
introducing the element of a four-year age difference between the
accused and the underage complainant. Report of the Senate Judicial
Proceedings Committee, at 2. As originally enacted by ch. 573 of the
Acts of 1976, sexual intercourse with a person under 14 by an actor more
than four years older was classified as rape in the first degree, and
carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Legislature, by ch.
292 of the Acts of 1977, reduced the crime to rape in the second degree
carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. **\[ ... \]**

Section 463(a)(3) does not expressly set forth a requirement that the
accused have acted with a criminal state of mind, or *mens rea.* The
State insists that the statute, by design, defines a strict liability
offense, and that its essential elements were met in the instant case
when Raymond, age 20, engaged in vaginal intercourse with Erica, a girl
under 14 and more than 4 years his junior. Raymond replies that the
criminal law exists to assess and punish morally culpable behavior. He
says such culpability was absent here. He asks us either to engraft onto
subsection (a)(3) an implicit *mens rea* requirement, or to recognize an
affirmative defense of reasonable mistake as to the complainant's age.
Raymond argues that it is unjust, under the circumstances of this case
which led him to think his conduct lawful, to brand him a felon and
rapist.

Ill

Raymond asserts that the events of this case were inconsistent with the
criminal sexual exploitation of a minor by an adult. As earlier
observed, Raymond entered Erica's bedroom at the girl's invitation; she
directed him to use a ladder to reach her window. They engaged
voluntarily in sexual intercourse.. They remained together in the room
for more than seven hours before Raymond departed at dawn. With an I.Q.
of 52, Raymond functioned at approximately the same level as the
13-year-old Erica; he was mentally an adolescent in an adult's body.
Arguably, had Raymond's chronological age, 20, matched his
socio-intellectual age, about 12, he and Erica would have fallen well
within the four-year age difference obviating a violation of the
statute, and Raymond would not have been charged with any crime at all.

To be sure, legislative bodies since the mid-19th century have created
strict liability criminal offenses requiring no *mens rea.* Almost all
such statutes responded to the demands of public health and welfare
arising from the complexities of society after the Industrial
Revolution. Typically misdemeanors involving only fines or other light
penalties, these strict liability laws regulated food, milk, liquor,
medicines and drugs, securities, motor vehicles and traffic, the
labeling of goods for sale, and the like. **\[ ... \]**Statutory rape,
carrying the stigma of felony as well as a potential sentence of 20
years in prison, contrasts markedly with the other strict liability
regulatory offenses and their light penalties.

Modern scholars generally reject the concept of strict criminal
liability. **\[ ... \]**

Dean Singer has articulated other weaknesses of strict criminal
liability theory: 1) extensive government civil regulations and strict
liability in tort achieve the same deterrent effect; 2) the judicial
efficiency of dispatching minor offenses without an inquiry into *mens
rea* is attained equally by decriminalizing them, and hearing such cases
in a regulatory or administrative forum; 3) the small penalties imposed
for most strict liability offenses oblige the public to engage in a
pernicious game of distinguishing "real" crime from some lesser form of
crime; 4) some strict liability laws may result from careless drafting;
and 5) strict liability dilutes the moral force that the criminal law
has historically carried. *Singer, supra,* at 389-397, 403-404. The
author concludes that "the predicate for all criminal liability is
blameworthiness; it is the social stigma which a finding of guilt
carries that distinguishes the criminal \[penalty\] from all other
sanctions. If the predicate is removed, the criminal law is set adrift."
*Id.* at 404-405.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

The commentators similarly disapprove of statutory rape as a strict
liability crime. In addition to the arguments discussed above, they
observe that statutory rape prosecutions often proceed even when the
defendant's judgment as to the age of the complainant is warranted by
her appearance, her sexual sophistication, her verbal
misrepresentations, and the defendant's careful attempts to ascertain
her true age. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** Moreover, the criminalization of an act, performed without
a guilty mind, deemed immoral by some members of the community rests
uneasily on subjective and shifting norms. **\[ ... \]**The drafters of
the Model Penal Code remarked:

> "\[T\]he actor who reasonably believes that his partner is above that
> age \[of consent\] lacks culpability with respect to the factor deemed
> critical to liability. Punishing him anyway simply because his
> intended conduct would have been immoral under the facts as he
> supposed them to be postulates a relation between criminality and
> immorality that is inaccurate on both descriptive and normative
> grounds. The penal law does not try to enforce all aspects of
> community morality, and any thoroughgoing attempt to do so would
> extend the prospect of criminal sanctions far into the sphere of
> individual liberty and create a regime too demanding for all save the
> best among us."

**\[ ... \]**

The legislatures of 17 states have enacted laws permitting a mistake of
age defense in some form in cases of sexual offenses with underage
persons. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

V

We think it sufficiently clear, however, that Maryland's second degree
rape statute defines a strict liability offense that does not require
the State to prove *mens rea;* it makes no allowance for a
mistake-of-age defense. The plain language of § 463, viewed in its
entirety, and the legislative history of its creation lead to this
conclusion.

It is well settled that in interpreting a statute to ascertain and
effectuate its goal, our first recourse is to the words of the statute,
giving them their ordinary and natural import.**\[ ... \]**To that end,
the Court may appropriately look at the larger context, including
external manifestations of the legislative purpose, within which
statutory language appears. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

Second, an examination of the drafting history of § 463 during the 1976
revision of Maryland's sexual offense laws reveals that the statute was
viewed as one of strict liability from its inception and throughout the
amendment process. **\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

In the light of such legislative action, we must inevitably conclude
that the current law imposes strict liability on its violators.

This interpretation is consistent with the traditional view of statutory
rape as a strict liability crime designed to protect young persons from
the dangers of sexual exploitation by adults, loss of chastity, physical
injury, and, in the case of girls, pregnancy. **\[ ... \]**The majority
of states retain statutes which impose strict liability for sexual acts
with underage complainants. We observe again, as earlier, that even
among those states providing for a mistake-of-age defense in some
instances, the defense often is not available where the sex partner is
14 years old or less; the complaining witness in the instant case was
only 13. **\[ ... \]**

Maryland's second degree rape statute is by nature a creature of
legislátion. Any new provision introducing an element of *mens rea,* or
permitting a defense of reasonable mistake of age, with respect to the
offense of sexual intercourse with a person less than 14, should
properly result from an act of the Legislature itself, rather than
judicial fiat. Until then, defendants in extraordinary cases, like
Raymond, will rely upon the tempering discretion of the trial court at
sentencing.

*JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.*

**\[ ... \]**

ROBERT M. BELL, Judge,

dissenting.

> **\[ ... \]**

I do not dispute that the legislative history of Maryland Code (1957,
1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, section 463 may be read to support the
majority's interpretation that subsection (a)(3)[^21] was intended to be
a strict liability statute. *See* majority opinion at 585. Nor do I
disagree that it is in the public interest to protect the sexually naive
child from the adverse physical, emotional, or psychological effects of
sexual relations. I do not believe, however, that the General Assembly,
in every case, whatever the nature of the crime and no matter how harsh
the potential penalty, can subject a defendant to strict criminal
liability. To hold, *as a matter of law,* that section 463(a)(3)[^22]
does not require the State to prove that a defendant possessed the
necessary mental state to commit the crime, *ie.* knowingly engaged in
sexual relations with a female under 14, or that the defendant may not
litigate that issue in defense, "offends a principle of justice so
rooted in the traditions of conscience of our people as to be ranked as
fundamental" and is, therefore, inconsistent with due process. **\[ ...
\]\[ ... \]**

In the case *sub judice,* according to the defendant, he intended to
have sex with a 16, not a 13, year old girl. This mistake of fact was
prompted, he said, by the prosecutrix herself; she and her friends told
him that she was 16 years old. Because he was mistaken as to the
prosecutrix's age, he submits, he is certainly less culpable than the
person who knows that the minor is 13 years old, but nonetheless engages
in sexual relations with her. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Obviously, and the majority concurs, *see* majority opinion at 579,
"statutory rape" is not merely a public welfare offense; it simply does
not "fit" the characteristics of such an offense: it is a felony, not a
misdemeanor. In striking contrast to "other strict liability regulatory
offenses and their light penalties," majority opinion at 579, the
potential penalty of 20 years imprisonment is not a light penalty;
unlike the "garden variety" strict liability penalty, the penalty under
section 463(a)(3), is neither so insignificant that it can be ignored as
a criminal sanction, **\[ ... \]**

B.

The second class of strict liability offenses, having a different
justification than public welfare offenses, consists of narcotic,[^23]
bigamy,[^24] adultery, and statutory rape crimes. **\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In utilizing the moral wrong theory, State legislatures seek to justify
strict criminal liability for statutory rape when non-marital sexual
intercourse is not a crime on the basis of society's characterization of
it as immoral or wrong, *i.e., malum in se.*[^25] **\[ ... \]**

There are significant problems with the moral wrong theory. First, it is
questionable whether morality should be the basis for legislation or
interpretation of the law. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

III\. Mistake of Fact

Generally, a mistake of fact negates the mental state required to
establish a material element of the crime. **\[ ... \]**. A person who
engages in proscribed conduct is relieved of criminal liability if,
because of ignorance or mistake of fact, he or she did not entertain the
culpable mental state required for the commission of the offense. **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

IV\. Constitutional Limitations on Strict Criminal Liability

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Under our system of justice, a person charged with a crime is presumed
innocent until he or she is found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That
means that he or she may not be found guilty until the State has
produced evidence sufficient to convince the trier of fact, to the
required extent, of that person's guilt. Moreover, although not required
to do so, the defendant may present a defense, in which event the
evidence the defendant produces must be assessed along with that of the
State in determining whether the State has met its burden. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

When the Legislature enacts a strict liability crime, *ie.,* promulgates
a statute which excludes as an element, the defendant's mental state, it
essentially creates an irrebuttable presumption that the defendant's
mental state, *ie.,* knowledge or intent, is irrelevant. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In *Lambert,* a Los Angeles ordinance required convicted felons who
remained in the city for more than five days to register with the
police. It did not contain any "knowledge" or *mens rea* requirement.
The Supreme Court held:

> actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability
> of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary
> before a conviction under the ordinance can stand\.... Where a person
> did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of
> the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted
> consistently with due process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as
> great as it is when the law is written in print too fine or in a
> language foreign to the community.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The failure of section 463(a)(3) to require proof of a culpable mental
state conflicts both with the substantive due process ideal requiring
that defendants possess some level of fault for a criminal conviction of
statutory rape and the procedural due process ideal requiring that the
prosecution overcome the presumption of innocence by proof of the
defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding the maxim
that criminal statutes dispensing with the intent requirement and
criminal offenses requiring no *mens rea* have a "generally disfavored
status," the rationale of parts V and VI of the majority opinion is that
the legislature has absolute authority to create strict liability
crimes. For the reasons reviewed, I do not agree. On the contrary, I
believe that due process both under the Fourteenth Amendment and under
the Declaration of Rights, precludes strict criminal liability for
statutory rape. **\[ ... \]** By making the defendant's intent, and,
hence, blameworthiness, irrelevant, the Legislature has made inevitable,
the petitioner's conviction. Moreover, upon conviction of the felony
offense of statutory rape under section 463(a)(3), in addition to a
substantial penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, a defendant's
reputation will be gravely besmirched. **\[ ... \]**

I respectfully dissent.

### *People v. Marrero*

New York Court of Appeals

69 N.Y.2d 382 (1987)

 

BELLACOSA, J.

The defense of mistake of law (Penal Law § 15.20) is not available to a
Federal corrections officer arrested in a Manhattan social club for
possession of a loaded .38 caliber automatic pistol who claimed he
mistakenly believed he was entitled, pursuant to the interplay of CPL
2.10, 1.20 and Penal Law § 265.20, to carry a handgun without a permit
as a peace officer.

On the trial of the case, the court rejected the defendant\'s argument
that his personal misunderstanding of the statutory definition of a
peace officer is enough to excuse him from criminal liability under New
York\'s mistake of law statute. The court refused to charge the jury on
this issue and defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a
weapon in the third degree. We affirm the Appellate Division order
upholding the conviction.

\[CPL 1.20 provided an exception to the certain firearm possession laws
for peace officers and section 2.10 defined peace officer to include
\"correction officers of any state correction facility or of any penal
correctional institution.\"\]

Defendant was a Federal corrections officer in Danbury, Connecticut, and
asserted that status at the time of his arrest in 1977. He claimed at
trial that there were various interpretations of fellow officers and
teachers, as well as the peace officer statute itself, upon which he
relied for his mistaken belief that he could carry a weapon with legal
impunity.

The starting point for our analysis is the New York mistake statute as
an outgrowth of the dogmatic common-law maxim that ignorance of the law
is no excuse. The central issue is whether defendant\'s personal
misreading or misunderstanding of a statute may excuse criminal conduct
in the circumstances of this case.

The common-law rule on mistake of law was clearly articulated
in *Gardner v People.* In *Gardner,* the defendants misread a statute
and mistakenly believed that their conduct was legal. The court
insisted, however, that the \"mistake of law\" did not relieve the
defendants of criminal liability.

The desirability of the *Gardner*-type outcome, which was to encourage
the societal benefit of individuals\' knowledge of and respect for the
law, is underscored by Justice Holmes\' statement: \"It is no doubt true
that there are many cases in which the criminal could not have known
that he was breaking the law, but to admit the excuse at all would be to
encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make men know
and obey, and justice to the individual is rightly outweighed by the
larger interests on the other side of the scales\" (Holmes, The Common
Law, at 48 \[1881\]).

The revisors of New York\'s Penal Law intended no fundamental departure
from this common-law rule in Penal Law § 15.20, which provides in
pertinent part:

§ 15.20. *Effect of ignorance or mistake upon liability.*

\(2\) \"A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct
because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does
not, as a matter of law, constitute an offense, unless such mistaken
belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in

\(a\) a statute or other enactment \* \* \*

\(d\) an interpretation of the statute or law relating to the offense,
officially made or issued by a public servant, agency, or body legally
charged or empowered with the responsibility  or privilege of
administering, enforcing or interpreting such statute or law.\"

This section was added to the Penal Law as part of the wholesale
revision of the Penal Law in 1965. When this provision was first
proposed, commentators viewed the new language as codifying \"the
established common law maxim on mistake of law, while at the same time
recognizing a defense when the erroneous belief is founded upon an
\'official statement of the law\'\"

The defendant claims as a first prong of his defense that he is entitled
to raise the defense of mistake of law under section 15.20(2)(a) because
his mistaken belief that his conduct was legal was founded upon an
official statement of the law contained in the statute itself. Defendant
argues that his mistaken interpretation of the statute was reasonable in
view of the alleged ambiguous wording of the peace officer exemption
statute, and that his \"reasonable\" interpretation of an \"official
statement\" is enough to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (2)(a).
However, the whole thrust of this exceptional exculpatory concept, in
derogation of the traditional and common-law principle, was intended to
be a very narrow escape valve. Application in this case would invert
that thrust and make mistake of law a generally applied or available
defense instead of an unusual exception which the very opening words of
the mistake statute make so clear \"\[a\] person is not relieved of
criminal liability for conduct \* \* \* unless...\" The momentarily
enticing argument by defendant that his view of the statute would only
allow a defendant to get the issue generally before a jury further
supports the contrary view because that consequence is precisely what
would give the defense the unintended broad practical application.

The prosecution further counters defendant\'s argument by asserting that
one cannot claim the protection of mistake of law under section
15.20(2)(a) simply by misconstruing the meaning of a statute but must
instead establish that the statute relied on actually permitted the
conduct in question and was only later found to be erroneous. To
buttress that argument, the People analogize New York\'s official
statement defense to the approach taken by the Model Penal Code (MPC).
Section 2.04 of the MPC provides: 

Section 2.04. *Ignorance or Mistake.*

\"(3) A belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a
defense to a prosecution for that offense based upon such conduct when
\* \* \*

\(b\) he acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the
law, *afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous,* contained in

\(i\) a statute or other enactment\" (emphasis added).

Although the drafters of the New York statute did not adopt the precise
language of the Model Penal Code provision with the emphasized clause,
it is evident and has long been believed that the Legislature intended
the New York statute to be similarly construed. In fact, the legislative
history of section 15.20 is replete with references to the influence of
the Model Penal Code provision.

In the case before us, the underlying statute never, *in
fact*,* authorized* the defendant\'s conduct; the defendant only thought
that the statutory exemptions permitted his conduct when, in fact, the
primary statute clearly forbade his conduct. Moreover, by adjudication
of the final court to speak on the subject in this very case, it turned
out that even the exemption statute did not permit this defendant to
possess the weapon. It would be ironic at best and an odd perversion at
worst for this court now to declare that the same defendant is
nevertheless free of criminal responsibility.

It must also be emphasized that, while our construction of Penal Law §
15.20 provides for narrow application of the mistake of law defense, it
does not, as the dissenters contend, \"rule out *any* defense based on
mistake of law.\" To the contrary, mistake of law is a viable exemption
in those instances where an individual demonstrates an effort to learn
what the law is, relies on the validity of that law and, later, it is
determined that there was a *mistake in the law itself.*

The modern availability of this defense is based on the theory that
where the government has affirmatively, albeit unintentionally, misled
an individual as to what may or may not be legally permissible conduct,
the individual should not be punished as a result. This is salutary and
enlightened and should be firmly supported in appropriate cases.
However, it also follows that where, as here, the government is not
responsible for the error (for there is none except in the defendant\'s
own mind), mistake of law should not be available as an excuse. 

We conclude that the better and correctly construed view is that the
defense should not be recognized, except where specific intent is an
element of the offense or where the misrelied-upon law has later been
properly adjudicated as wrong. Any broader view fosters lawlessness. It
has been said in support of our preferred view in relation to other
available procedural protections:

\"A statute\...which is so indefinite that it \'either forbids or
requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common
intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application, violates the first essential of due process of law\' and is
unconstitutional. If the court feels that a statute is sufficiently
definite to meet this test, it is hard to see why a defense of mistake
of law is needed. Such a statute could hardly mislead the defendant into
believing that his acts were not criminal, if they do in fact come under
its ban \... \[I\]f the defense of mistake of law based on
indefiniteness is raised, the court is\...going to require proof\...that
the act was sufficiently definite to guide the conduct of reasonable
men. Thus, the need for such a defense is largely supplied by the
constitutional guarantee\"

Strong public policy reasons underlie the legislative mandate and intent
which we perceive in rejecting the defendant\'s construction of New
York\'s mistake of law defense statute. If defendant\'s argument were
accepted, the exception would swallow the rule. Mistakes about the law
would be encouraged, rather than respect for and adherence to law. There
would be an infinite number of mistake of law defenses which could be
devised from a good-faith, perhaps reasonable but mistaken,
interpretation of criminal statutes, many of which are concededly
complex. Even more troublesome are the opportunities for wrongminded
individuals to contrive in bad faith solely to get an exculpatory notion
before the jury. These are not *in terrorem* arguments disrespectful of
appropriate adjudicative procedures; rather, they are the realistic and
practical consequences were the dissenters\' views to prevail. Our
holding comports with a statutory scheme which was not designed to allow
false and diversionary stratagems to be provided for many more cases
than the statutes contemplated. This would not serve the ends of justice
but rather would serve game playing and evasion from properly imposed
criminal responsibility.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

 

HANCOCK, JR., J. (dissenting).

The basic difference which divides the court may be simply put. Suppose
the case of a man who has committed an act which is criminal not because
it is inherently wrong or immoral but solely because it violates a
criminal statute. He has committed the act in complete good faith under
the mistaken but entirely reasonable assumption that the act does not
constitute an offense because it is permitted by the wording of the
statute. Does the law require that this man be punished? The majority
says that it does and holds that (1) Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) must be
construed so that the man is precluded from offering a defense based on
his mistake of law and (2) such construction is compelled by prevailing
considerations of public policy and criminal jurisprudence. We take
issue with the majority on both propositions.

 It is difficult to imagine a case more squarely within the wording of
Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) or one more fitted to what appears clearly to be
the intended purpose of the statute than the one before us. For this
reason it is helpful to discuss the statute and its apparent intended
effect in the light of what defendant contends was his mistaken belief
founded on an official statement of the law contained in a statute.

The majority... has accepted the People\'s argument that to have a
defense under Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) \"a defendant must show that the
statute *permitted his conduct,* not merely that he believed it did.\"
Here, of course, the defendant cannot show that the statute permitted
his conduct. To the contrary, the question has now been decided by the
Appellate Division and it is settled that defendant was not exempt under
Penal Law § 265.20(a)(1)(a). Therefore, the argument goes, defendant can
have no mistake of law defense. While conceding that reliance on a
statutory provision which is later found to be invalid would constitute
a mistake of law defense the People\'s flat position is that \"one\'s
mistaken reading of a statute, no matter how reasonable or well
intentioned, is not a defense.\"

\[T\]he majority bases its decision on an analogous provision in the
Model Penal Code and concludes that despite its totally different
wording and meaning Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) should be read as if it were
Model Penal Code § 2.04(3)(b)(i). But New York, in revising the Penal
Law, did not adopt the Model Penal Code. As in New Jersey, which
generally adopted the Model Penal Code but added one section which is
substantially more liberal, New York followed parts of the Model Penal
Code provisions and rejected others. In *People v. Goetz,* we said that
the Legislature\'s rejection of the verbatim provisions of the Model
Penal Code was crucial in determining its intent in drafting the
statute. The significance of the alterations here can be no different.

Any fair reading of the majority opinion, we submit, demonstrates that
the decision to reject a mistake of law defense is based on
considerations of public policy and on the conviction that such a
defense would be bad, rather than on an analysis of CPL 15.20(2)(a)
under the usual principles of statutory construction The majority warns,
for example, that if the defense were permitted \"the exception would
swallow the rule\"; that \"\[m\]istakes about the law would be
encouraged\"; that an \"infinite number of mistake of law defenses\...
could be devised\"; and that \"wrongminded individuals \[could\]
contrive in bad faith solely to get an exculpatory notion before the
jury.\"

These considerations, like the People\'s argument that the mistake of
law defense \"would encourage ignorance where knowledge is socially
desired\" (Respondent\'s Brief, at 28.), are the very considerations
which have been consistently offered as justifications for the maxim
*\"ignorantia legis\".* That these justifications are unabashedly
utilitarian cannot be questioned. It could not be put more candidly than
by Justice Holmes in defending the common-law maxim more than 100 years
ago: *\"Public policy sacrifices the individual to the general good
\...* It is no doubt true that there are many cases in which the
criminal could not have known that he was breaking the law, but to admit
the excuse at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker
has determined to make men know and obey, and *justice to the individual
is rightly outweighed by the larger interests on the other side of the
scales\"* (Holmes, The Common Law, at 48 \[1881\]; emphasis added).
Regardless of one\'s attitude toward the acceptability of these views in
the 1980s, the fact remains that the Legislature in abandoning the
strict *\"ignorantia legis\"* maxim must be deemed to have rejected
them.

We believe that the concerns expressed by the majority are matters which
properly should be and have been addressed by the Legislature. We note
only our conviction that a statute which recognizes a defense based on a
man\'s good-faith mistaken belief founded on a well-grounded
interpretation of an official statement of the law contained in a
statute is a just law. The law embodies the ideal of contemporary
criminal jurisprudence \"that punishment should be conditioned on a
showing of subjective moral blameworthiness."

Lambert v. California

 

### *Lambert v. California*

United States Supreme Court

355 U.S. 225 (1957)

 

Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Section 52.38(a) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code defines "convicted
person" as follows:

"Any person who, subsequent to January 1, 1921, has been or hereafter is
convicted of an offense punishable as a felony in the State of
California, or who has been or who is hereafter convicted of any offense
in any place other than the State of California, which offense, if
committed in the State of California, would have been punishable as a
felony."

Section 52.39 provides that it shall be unlawful for "any convicted
person" to be or remain in Los Angeles for a period of more than five
days without registering; it requires any person having a place of abode
outside the city to register if he comes into the city on five occasions
or more during a 30-day period; and it prescribes the information to be
furnished the Chief of Police on registering.

Section 52.43(b) makes the failure to register a continuing offense,
each day's failure constituting a separate offense.

Appellant, arrested on suspicion of another offense, was charged with a
violation of this registration law. The evidence showed that she had
been at the time of her arrest a resident of Los Angeles for over seven
years. Within that period she had been convicted in Los Angeles of the
crime of forgery, an offense which California punishes as a felony.
Though convicted of a crime punishable as a felony, she had not at the
time of her arrest registered under the Municipal Code. At the trial,
appellant asserted that § 52.39 of the Code denies her due process of
law and other rights under the Federal Constitution, unnecessary to
enumerate. The trial court denied this objection. The case was tried to
a jury which found appellant guilty. The court fined her \$250 and
placed her on probation for three years. The registration provision,
carrying criminal penalties, applies if a person has been convicted "of
an offense punishable as a felony in the State of California" or, in
case he has been convicted in another State, if the offense "would have
been punishable as a felony" had it been committed in California. No
element of willfulness is by terms included in the ordinance nor read
into it by the California court as a condition necessary for a
conviction.

We must assume that appellant had no actual knowledge of the requirement
that she register under this ordinance, as she offered proof of this
defense which was refused. The question is whether a registration act of
this character violates due process where it is applied to a person who
has no actual knowledge of his duty to register, and where no showing is
made of the probability of such knowledge.

We do not go with Blackstone in saying that "a vicious will" is
necessary to constitute a crime, for conduct alone without regard to the
intent of the doer is often sufficient. There is wide latitude in the
lawmakers to declare an offense and to exclude elements of knowledge and
diligence from its definition. But we deal here with conduct that is
wholly passive --- mere failure to register. It is unlike the commission
of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the
doer to the consequences of his deed The rule that "ignorance of the law
will not excuse is deep in our law, as is the principle that of all the
powers of local government, the police power is "one of the least
limitable." On the other hand, due process places some limits on its
exercise. Engrained in our concept of due process is the requirement of
notice. Notice is sometimes essential so that the citizen has the chance
to defend charges. Notice is required before property interests are
disturbed, before assessments are made, before penalties are assessed.
Notice is required in a myriad of situations where a penalty or
forfeiture might be suffered for mere failure to act.

Registration laws are common and their range is wide. Many such laws are
akin to licensing statutes in that they pertain to the regulation of
business activities. But the present ordinance is entirely different.
Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever,
mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which
might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are
completely lacking. At most the ordinance is but a law enforcement
technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies
through which a list of the names and addresses of felons then residing
in a given community is compiled. The disclosure is merely a compilation
of former convictions already publicly recorded in the jurisdiction
where obtained. Nevertheless, this appellant on first becoming aware of
her duty to register was given no opportunity to comply with the law and
avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. She
could but suffer the consequences of the ordinance, namely, conviction
with the imposition of heavy criminal penalties thereunder. We believe
that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the
probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are
necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand. As Holmes
wrote in The Common Law, "A law which punished conduct which would not
be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too
severe for that community to bear." Its severity lies in the absence of
an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend
any prosecution brought under it. Where a person did not know of the
duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such
knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process. Were
it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is
written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the
community.

Reversed.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter, whom Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice
Whittaker join, dissenting.

The present laws of the United States and of the forty-eight States are
thick with provisions that command that some things not be done and
others be done, although persons convicted under such provisions may
have had no awareness of what the law required or that what they did was
wrongdoing. The body of decisions sustaining such legislation, including
innumerable registration laws, is almost as voluminous as the
legislation itself. The matter is summarized in *United States v.
Balint*, 258 U. S. 250, 252: "Many instances of this are to be found in
regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power
where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some
social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases
of mala in se."

Surely there can hardly be a difference as a matter of fairness, of
hardship, or of justice, if one may invoke it, between the case of a
person wholly innocent of wrongdoing, in the sense that he was not
remotely conscious of violating any law, who is imprisoned for five
years for conduct relating to narcotics, and the case of another person
who is placed on probation for three years on condition that she pay
\$250, for failure, as a local resident, convicted under local law of a
felony, to register under a law passed as an exercise of the State's
"police power." Considerations of hardship often lead courts, naturally
enough, to attribute to a statute the requirement of a certain mental
element --- some consciousness of wrongdoing and knowledge of the law's
command --- as a matter of statutory construction. Then, too, a cruelly
disproportionate relation between what the law requires and the sanction
for its disobedience may constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment
as a cruel and unusual punishment, and, in respect to the States, even
offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

But what the Court here does is to draw a constitutional line between a
State's requirement of doing and not doing. What is this but a return to
Year Book distinctions between feasance and nonfeasance --- a
distinction that may have significance in the evolution of common-law
notions of liability, but is inadmissible as a line between
constitutionality and unconstitutionality. One can be confident that Mr.
Justice Holmes would have been the last to draw such a line. What he
wrote about "blameworthiness" is worth quoting in its context:

"It is not intended to deny that criminal liability, as well as civil,
is founded on blameworthiness. Such a denial would shock the moral sense
of any civilized community; or, to put it another way, a law which
punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of
the community would be too severe for that community to bear." (This
passage must be read in the setting of the broader discussion of which
it is an essential part. Holmes, The Common Law, at 49-50.)

If the generalization that underlies, and alone can justify, this
decision were to be given its relevant scope, a whole volume of the
United States Reports would be required to document in detail the
legislation in this country that would fall or be impaired. I abstain
from entering upon a consideration of such legislation, and
adjudications upon it, because I feel confident that the present
decision will turn out to be an isolated deviation from the strong
current of precedents --- a derelict on the waters of the law.
Accordingly, I content myself with dissenting.

Questions re Strict Liability

 

1\. Can you reconcile the majority opinions in Staples with that in
Garnett?

2\. How does strict liability particularly impact those who have
disabilities, like the defendant in Garnett?

3\. What statutory intepretation tools are courts in these cases using
to determine the mens rea the legislation intended?

4\. What,  if any, limitations should exist on a legislature\'s ability
to create strict liability crimes? (see Garnett disssent, Lambert)

 

 

 

9.8

Mistake of Fact v Mistake of (Criminal) Law

 

**Mistake of Fact**

A mistake of fact is a mistake that can negate the mens rea for a crime.
For instance, if a theft statute specifies a knowing mens rea, a person
can successfully argue that they don\'t have the mens rea if they took a
computer that belonged to Jane, but they thought it was their computer.
Accordingly, they don\'t have a knowing mens rea and are factually
innocent.

 

**Mistake of Law**

A mistake of CRIMINAL law is almost never a mistake (except for a very
narrow reliance exception\--see Lambert) because to argue that you
can\'t be convicted because you didn\'t know that, eg, possessing a
machine gun without a licence was illegal in your state, would open the
door to too much harmful or risky behavior. 

 

 

 

9.9

Mistake of Other Law

 

is treated like a mistake of fact.

 

A few illustrations:

David Smith rented an apartment flat and installed electric wiring,
roofing material, asbestos wall panels, and floor boards in part of the
flat. Those modifications were completed with the landlord's
permissions. A few years later, Smith gave notice that he was moving
out. Smith then removed the electrical wiring and damaged the roofing,
wall panels, and floorboards in the process. Smith was indicted for
knowing destruction of property.. During the trial, Smith presented
evidence that he believed he was damaging his own property because he
had installed the materials. The trial judge instructed the jury that
the only defense under the statute charged was that the defendant had a
lawful excuse to damage the property. 

The appellate court reversed because the defendant did not make a
mistake about criminal law, but rather about property law, so he lacked
the requisite mens rea for destruction of property.

 

Another case:

In the 1930s, the defendant married a man in Reno, Nevada immediately
after an alleged divorce from his wife in Vermont was granted by the
very judge who granted the divorce decree. Vermont did not recognize the
Nevada divorce. The trial court convicted respondent of engaging in
adultery (knowledge mens rea).  Defendant argued that she had an honest
belief in the validity of the Nevada divorce and that her subsequent
marriage was a defense to criminal prosecution. 

Correct outcome: Her mistake was not about the criminal law\--i.e. she
knew that adultery was then illegal\--but rather about family law. So
her mistake erases the necessary knowledge mens rea.

Question: Would the outcome change if the adultery statute had only a
reckless mens rea?

Before BAZELON, Chief Judge, LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge, and ADAMS,[^26]
Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge:

Seven of the so-called "D.C. Nine" bring this joint appeal from
convictions arising out of their unconsented entry into the Washington
offices of the Dow Chemical Company, and their destruction of certain
property therein. Appellants,[^27] along with two other defendants who
subsequently entered pleas of nolo contendere,[^28] were tried before
District Judge John H. Pratt and a jury on a three count indictment
alleging, as to each defendant, one count of second degree burglary, 22
D.C.Code § 1801(b), and two counts of malicious destruction of property
valued in excess of \$100, 22 D.C.Code § 403. On February 11, 1970,
after a six-day trial, the seven were each convicted of two counts of
malicious destruction. The jury acquitted on the burglary charges but
convicted on the lesser-included offense of unlawful entry. The
sentences imposed are set forth in the margin.[^29]

Appellants urge three grounds for reversal as follows: (1) The trial
judge erred in denying defendants' timely motions to dispense with
counsel and represent themselves. (2) The judge erroneously refused to
instruct the jury of its right to acquit appellants without regard to
the law and the evidence, and refused to permit appellants to argue that
issue to the jury. (3) The instructions actually given by the court
coerced the jury into delivering a verdict of guilty. On the basis of
defendants' first contention we reverse and remand for new trial. To
provide an appropriate mandate governing the new trial, we consider the
second and third contentions, and conclude that these cannot be
accepted.

I. *The Record in District Court*

The undisputed evidence showed that on Saturday, March 22, 1969,
appellants broke into the locked fourth floor Dow offices at 1030 - 15th
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., threw papers and documents about the
office and into the street below, vandalized office furniture and
equipment, and defaced the premises by spilling about a bloodlike
substance. The prosecution proved its case through Dow employees who
testified as to the lack of permission and extent of damage, members of
the news media who had been summoned to the scene by the appellants and
who witnessed the destruction while recording it photographically, and
police officers who arrested appellants on the scene.

Initially, the court appointed separate counsel for each defendant.
Following their arraignment on June 20, 1969, all save appellant Robert
Begin elected interim joint representation by Philip Hirschkop, Addison
Bowman and Caroline Nickerson. Mr. Begin was represented by Edward
Bennett Williams. All attorneys were court-appointed.

At the pre-trial conference held on January 29, 1970, in his chambers,
Judge Pratt indicated he had received a letter from Mr. Hirschkop to the
effect that appellants JoAnn Malone, Arthur Melville, and Joseph
O'Rourke no longer wished to be represented by counsel. On his own
behalf, appellant Begin had written the Court requesting that the
appointment of Mr. Williams be terminated, and that he be permitted a
*pro se* defense. Judge Pratt deferred a ruling on the *pro se* motions
in order to give the matter further consideration, observing that to
waive counsel

> is not quite as easy as merely getting up and saying that you want to
> represent yourself. You've got the matter of the waiver being knowing
> and intelligent, and we are going to take testimony on that; and
> furthermore, the possibility of prejudice, not only to themselves but
> also to their co-defendants. (Tr. 3)

Later in the conference he indicated how important he felt the lawyer's
role was likely to be in achieving tranquility at trial:

> \[L\]et me emphasize as strongly as I can that the way this ease is
> handled is presumably my responsibility, but the decorum in the
> courtroom --- I'm talking particularly about the defendants themselves
> --- will be affected to a great degree by the advice and example that
> they get from their own lawyers. (Tr. 14).

The day before, it seems, Judge Pratt had attended a seminar on the
problems of disruption encountered in multi-de-fendant trials, and he
was concerned that "there have been rumors that maybe some disruptive
tactics are going to be employed." (Tr. 15, 17[^30]). Defense counsel
assured him that they knew of no such rumors and that they anticipated
no disruptive behavior. In any event, Judge Pratt scheduled a hearing
for February 3, 1970, on the four defendants' requests as a matter
preliminary to the trial.

At a "supplementary" conference the next day, January 30, the Judge
acceded to Mr. Williams's request that his associate, William McDaniels,
be substituted as Begin's counsel of record. Mr. Williams's request
stemmed from statements of emphatic, indeed vitriolic, dissatisfaction
with Mr. Williams's representation contained in Begin's motion for a
*pro se* defense.

At the February 3, 1970, hearing on the *pro se* motions, the four
original movants were joined by appellant Dougherty. For approximately
three-quarters of an hour the court heard from the five defendants and
from their lawyers. The judge showed particular interest in the
defendants' education, and specifically whether any of the five had had
formal legal training. None had, although appellant Begin asserted he
had "taken pains to familiarize (himself) with courtroom procedure." In
general, the testimony showed that the five mov-ants were quite
articulate and highly educated. It also appeared that all five movants
--- indeed all defendants save appellant Slaski --- were associated with
a religious order, either at that time or in the recent past and, in
varying degrees, had been active in work among the poor and
underprivileged, in this country and in Latin America.

After a brief recess, the court denied defendants' motions in an oral
opinion, set forth in the margin.[^31] The judge indicated that he was
not troubled by defendants' general educational background, nor,
importantly, by their motivation. However, he emphasized their lack of
formal legal training, the multi-defendant context of the trial, and the
seriousness of the charges. The interplay of those factors he felt
created too great a risk of disruption of the trial, and risk of jury
prejudice against mov-ants and their co-defendants. After the judge
delivered his ruling, there was some confused interchange between the
court, counsel and several defendants. At Mr. Hirschkop's request, court
was recessed in order that counsel and defendants could determine how to
proceed in light of the judge's ruling.

When court reconvened after lunch, all defendants were present and a
panel of prospective jurors sat in the rear of the courtroom. At that
time the remaining four defendants, Catherine Melville, Dennis Moloney,
Michael Slaski and Bernard Meyer, made oral motions to represent
themselves. These new motions were prompted in large part by the judge's
earlier emphasis on prejudice to co-defendants with counsel as a ground
for denying the original motions. After some discussion between the
court and the defendants, out of the presence of the veniremen, the
judge, treating the four new motions as timely made, formally denied
them for the reasons given in his oral opinion.

Some collateral matters were then disposed of, including a request ---
denied--- by Mr. Hirschkop that Judge Pratt disqualify himself. When the
court began its voir dire examination of prospective jurors, there was
some dispute about the judge's decision to question the jurors himself
rather than to follow the procedure of examination by counsel, but
appellants do not bring that issue into this appeal. Similarly,
appellants do not complain of the presence or absence of certain
questions for the prospective jurors, about which there was controversy
at the time.

Selection of the jury was reasonably rapid, requiring only a part of the
afternoon of Feb. 3 and part of the next morning. As noted, the court
conducted the voir dire. Defendants were, however, permitted to exercise
their peremptory challenges *in propria persona.*

The trial formally began on the afternoon of February 4. Judge Pratt
required that motions, objections, and examination of witnesses be made
through counsel. He did, however, agree to permit each defendant to make
a five minute opening statement and to testify, in narrative form, at
reasonable length without a specific time limit. After the prosecution's
opening statement, Mr. Hirschkop made a brief statement on behalf of all
defendants. Then five of the defendants --- including appellants
Dougherty, Begin and Arthur Melville--- made opening statements.

The prosecution's case was completed by the end of the next day,
February 5. Prior to the opening of the defense case, defendants
Catherine Melville and Bernard Meyer entered pleas of *nolo con-tendere*
to one count of malicious destruction of property; the remaining charges
were dismissed; and they are not before us on this appeal.

On Friday, February 6, after an opening statement by Mr. Bowman,
appellants O'Rourke and Malone made opening statements on their own
behalf, as the other defendants had done prior to the Government's case.
They directed their remarks, as had the others, to an attack on the role
of Dow Chemical Company and other unspecified corporations in supporting
American military efforts in the Vietnam War. When Sister Malone
referred to Vietnam, Judge Pratt interjected : "the war in Vietnam is
not an issue in this case." A disruption ensued. Events happened too
quickly for the court reporter to provide a complete record. The court
later inserted this description of what happened, Supplement to
Transcript, p. 595:

> The record being unclear as to what transpired in the courtroom
> shortly before the Court adjourned Friday, February 6, 1970, the
> following is a recital of those events.

> been cleared and the press, counsel and the defendants had been
> readmitted. The jury was recalled, admonished to disregard what it had
> seen, and sent home. The Court then adjourned until Monday, February
> 9, 1970.

When the trial resumed on Monday, February 9, defendant Slaski was cited
for contempt for his role in the disturbances and the judge sternly
admonished the spectators and remaining defendants against further
outbreaks. Appellants Slaski and Moloney did not make opening
statements. After appellant Malone finished her statement, the case for
the defense began. It consisted entirely of defendants' testimony.
Appellants Arthur. Melville, O'Rourke, Malone and Begin testified.
During the testimony there were several further disruptions requiring a
brief recess at one point and ejection of a spectator from the courtroom
at another.[^32] The judge confined closing argument to counsel. He
instructed the jury on the three counts of each indictment as well as on
the lesser-included offense of unlawful entry under the burglary count.
He refused to instruct the jury that it could disregard the law as he
gave it to them, and refused to instruct the jury that "moral
compulsion" or "choice of the lesser evil" constituted a legal defense.

II\. *The Right of Pro Se Representation*

In defendants' view, Judge Pratt violated their constitutional and
statutory rights when he refused to permit them to represent themselves.
They say the right to dispense with counsel is correlative to the
guarantee of the right to counsel and is therefore "implicit" in the
Sixth Amendment. They rely as well on 28 U.S.C. § 1654 which provides:

> In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct
> their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such
> courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes
> therein.

The Government responds that a defendant's right to represent himself is
not protected by the Sixth Amendment but only exists by virtue of §
1654, and that this is significant (a) because statutory rights are
generally subject to the "harmless error" principle, and (b) § 1654
rights can be limited when, in the judge's view, they would be likely to
lead to disruption of the trial or threaten to interfere with effective
presentation of the defendant's case.

A. *Absence of Controlling Precedent on Source of* Pro Se *Right*

The Supreme Court has never directly determined whether the Constitution
guarantees the *pro se* right. Appellants rely on Adams v. United States
ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 242, 87 L.Ed. 268
(1942) where the Court observed:

> \[t\]he right to assistance of counsel and the correlative right to
> dispense with a lawyer's help are not legal formalisms. They rest on
> considerations that go to the substance of an accused's position
> before the law. . . \[T\]he Constitution does not force a lawyer upon
> a defendant. He may waive his Constitutional right to assistance of
> counsel if he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes
> open.

However, *Adams's* "correlative right" language was not an essential
ingredient of its holding, which was simply that a defendant who has
intelligently waived his right to counsel may also waive his right to a
jury trial. Moreover, in Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 85 S.Ct.
783, 13 L.Ed.2d 630 (1965), holding a defendant's waiver of right to a
jury trial subject to the assent of the prosecution and the trial judge,
the Court said that "the ability to waive a constitutional right does
not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist on the opposite of that
right." 380 U.S. at 34-35, 85 S.Ct. at 789. It pointed out that

> \[t\]he Constitution recognizes an adversary system as the proper
> method of determining guilt, and the Government, as a litigant, has a
> legitimate interest in seeing that cases in which it believes a
> conviction is warranted are tried before the tribunal which the
> Constitution regards as most likely to produce a fair result. *Id.* at
> 36, 85 S.Ct. at 790.[^33]

There are conflicting indications from the circuits. The Second Circuit
in United States v. Plattner, 330 F.2d 271 (2d Cir. 1964), recognized
constitutional status for the *pro se* right. In accord with *Plattner,*
see Lowe v. United States, 418 F.2d 100 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. denied
397 U.S. 1048, 90 S.Ct. 1378, 25 L.Ed.2d 660 (1970); United States v.
Warner, 428 F.2d 730 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 400 U.S. 930, 91
S.Ct. 194, 27 L.Ed.2d 191 (1971); United States v. Pike, 439 F.2d 695
(9th Cir. 1971); Hodge v. United States, 414 F.2d 1040 (9th Cir. 1969).
*But compare* Juelich v. United States, 342 F.2d 29 (5th Cir. 1965); Van
Nattan v. United States, 357 F.2d 161 (10th Cir. 1966).

In our court, Brown v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 264 F.2d 363
(en banc 1959), left the issue unresolved. Reversal was sought because
the trial judge failed to instruct a defendant of his right to represent
himself when his court-appointed attorney informed the court that
defendant was dissatisfied with the attorney's pessimism about the
outcome of the case. There was no opinion for a majority of the court.
Judge Miller, joined by Judges Prettyman, Danaher and Bastían, stated
that the *pro se* right is statutory only, and therefore (a) defendant
must assert the right in order to be entitled to it and (b) in any event
no reversal was required since no prejudice could be discerned.

The opinions of the other five judges are consistent with a view that
the Constitution is the basis for the right, although only one expressly
discussed its source. Judge Burger, concurring in part, differed with
the others voting to affirm because he treated defendant's expression of
"dissatisfaction" as the equivalent of a request for removal of counsel,
but held it within the court's discretion to deny the request so long as
it was sufficiently apprised of the cause of the "dissatisfaction."

The four dissenters joined in an opinion stating that the reasons for
the "dissatisfaction" were not made sufficiently clear to the court to
permit the exercise of its informed discretion on the matter, and hence
the judge should have inquired further into the basis for defendant's
attitude and should have specifically informed defendant of his right to
proceed alone. The *pro se* alternative, they felt, is one of
fundamental importance, and a defendant can make an informed decision on
how best to conduct his defense only if he is made aware that he is free
to dispense with counsel. The principal dissent, however, made no
mention of the Constitution. Only Judge Bazelon, in a separate dissent,
said the *pro se* right was grounded in the Constitution.

B. *Need for Recognition of Statutory Right* --- If *Timely Asserted,
Not Waived, And Accompanied by Waiver of Right to Counsel*

The Government says the *pro se* right is statutory and subject to
"extensive qualifications," discerning in the decisions seven "factors"
on the basis of which the *pro se* right may be partially or entirely
denied.[^34]

This case does not require final resolution of the constitutional
question. That would be unavoidable had Congress attempted to narrow or
qualify the *pro se* right along the lines advocated by the Government
on this appeal. But that is not the case. The right of *pro se*
representation was enacted by our very first Congress. The language
declaring the *pro* se right is not qualified, see 28 U.S.C. § 1654. The
statute was passed in a context of colonial tribunals largely manned by
laymen, and of pioneer modes of thought emphasizing the virtues of
common sense and self-reli-anee.[^35] Its constitutional aura is
underscored by the proposal the very next day of the Sixth
Amendment.[^36]

In sum, whether or not the right of *pro se* representation has a
constitutional foundation it is patently a statutory right, see § 1654;
this right was not only conferred by Congress in 1789 but. has wide
reverberation in organic state law[^37] and was recognized by Congress
as a fundamental right. We conclude that this right must be recognized
if it is timely asserted, and accompanied by a valid waiver of counsel,
and if it is not itself waived, either expressly, or constructively, as
by disruptive behavior during trial.[^38]

The precedents relied on by the Government as subjecting the *pro se*
right to "extensive qualifications" do no more than establish these
basic elements : timely assertion; need for intelligent waiver of
counsel; and possibility of waiver of the *pro se* right. A number of
cases involved the special circumstance of defendants whose mental
capacity was impaired.[^39] The bulk of the cases cited to us involved
requests made after commencement of trial,[^40] and do no more than
apply the recognized principle that the fundamental right to conduct the
case *pro se* is one that must be claimed timely, before the trial
begins. Just as a defendant who has unrestricted right to retain counsel
of his own choosing must seek permission of the court once his choice
has been made, to select a different retained counsel, and is subject to
the sound discretion of the court when he seeks to make a change after
his trial has commenced, so a defendant must obtain the court's
permission when he seeks to make a change in order to select himself as
counsel.

When the *pro se* right is claimed after trial has begun, the court
exercises its discretion. It may weigh the inconvenience threatened by
defendant's belated request against the possible prejudice from denial
of defendant's request. In exercising discretion the judge may take into
account the circumstances at the time, whether there has been prior
disruptive behavior by defendant, whether the trial is in an advanced
stage, etc. *E. g.,* Seale v. Hoffman, *supra,* note 14; United States
v. Foster, 9 F.R.D. 367 (S.D.N.Y.1949). The right to
self-representation, though asserted before trial, can be lost by
disruptive behavior during trial, constituting constructive waiver. But
that is a far different situation from that presented by the instant
case, where appellants unequivocally claimed the right to represent
themselves, see Brown v. United States, *supra,* 105 U.S. App.D.C. at
81, 264 F.2d at 367 (Burger, J.), United States ex rel. Higgins v. Fay,
364 F.2d 219 (2d Cir. 1966), well in advance of the beginning of trial
and selection of the jury, see United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno,
348 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1965); *cf.* United States v. Thomas, 146
U.S.App.D.C. 308, 450 F.2d 1355 (1971).

C. *"Possible" Disruption as a Basis for Denying Pro Se Defense*

The Government seeks to sustain the denial of appellants' *pro se*
motions on a theory of "possible disruption." A list of five factors is
offered which, it is said, "taken together" support the judge's finding
of risk of disruption.

Given the general likelihood that *pro se* defendants have only
rudimentary acquaintanceship with the rules of evidence and courtroom
protocol, a measure of unorthodoxy, confusion and delay is likely,
perhaps inevitable, in *pro se* cases.[^41] The energy and time toll on
the trial judge, as fairness calls him to articulate ground rules and
reasons that need not be explained to an experienced trial counsel, can
be relieved, at least in part, by appointment of an amicus curiae to
assist the defendant.[^42] If defendant refrains from intentionally
obstructive tactics, amicus would be available to provide advice on
procedure and strategy. The utility of an amicus appointment is
dependent on explanation to and cooperation by defendant, and on
understanding, too, that he may claim with some merit that his *pro se*
rights include his right to appear before the jury in the status of one
defending himself, and that this is defeated if a too conspicuous role
is played by an attorney, unless it clearly appears to the jury that he
does not have the status of defense counsel.[^43]

On the other hand, a potentially unruly defendant may and should
be\'clearly forewarned that deliberate dilatory or obstructive behavior
may operate in effect as a waiver of his *pro se* rights and, in that
event, amicus will be ready to assume exclusive control of the
defense.[^44] The Supreme Court has recently emphasized that even
constitutional litigation prerogatives of a defendant are available to
give choice in the conduct of a trial, and do not extend so far as to
permit subversion of the core concept of a trial. Illinois v. Allen, 397
U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed. 2d 353 (1970). The same principle
means that obstreperous behavior may constitute waiver of the *pro se*
right.[^45]

Appointment of amicus counsel would not have resolved all the problems
presented by *pro se* defenses in the multi-defendant context involved
in this case. Thus, the prospect of repetitious interrogation of
witnesses would persist. But the joint trial that the prosecution seeks
in the interest of efficiency cannot set aside the fundamental right of
*pro se* representation. The trial judge must proceed by skill and
suasion, by obtaining defendants' cooperation, not by denying their *pro
se* rights.

We need not !here consider whether or in what circumstances withholding
of reasonable cooperation may be held equivalent to unruly action as a
waiver of the right of self-representation. In the case before us,
defendants and counsel assured the court, on several occasions, of their
lack of disruptive intent, *e. g.,* Tr. 23, 24. The judge in his oral
opinion noted that his fears of disruption did not stem from concern
over defendants' "motivations." Furthermore, the record shows how
reasonable cooperation was obtained from defendants, by a reasonable
accommodation of interests. When defendants expressed concern over their
exclusion from bench conferences, Judge Pratt made, and defendants
accepted (Tr. 333-335), a suggestion permitting a "representative"
defendant to participate in bench conferences as an observer. A similar
approach might have obviated any serious problems of repetitious
interrogation.[^46] In the last analysis, however, if the assertion of a
*pro se* right makes a multidefendant trial unmanageable, or unfair to
the other defendants, the remedy lies in severance. Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P.

In effect the unqualified right of self representation rests on an
implied presumption that the court will be able to achieve reasonable
cooperation. The possibility that reasonable cooperation may be
withheld, and the right later waived, is not a reason for denying the
right of self representation at the start.

D. *Lack of Foundation for Government Claims of Prior Disruptive
Behavior*

The Government argues that in this case there was disruptive behavior on
the part of defendants which sustains the judge's denial of *pro se*
representation. We assume, without deciding, that where there has been
experience with the particular defendants that is plainly identifiable
as disruptive in character, such as to overturn the premise of
reasonable cooperation, and permit a finding of anticipatory breach and
waiver, that would be a predicate for denying the *pro se* right. We do
not think any such predicate appears in this case.

We begin by rejecting the Government's approach of using "disruptive"
incidents following the denial of the *pro se* motions as reasons to
support that denial.[^47] This is like using the fruit of an
unreasonable search to provide a cause making the search reasonable.
Nearly all of the incidents cited by the Government concerned
assertions\' of the right to self-representation. It would be anomalous
to hold that the denial of one's rights can be justified by reference to
the nature of subsequent complaints protesting that denial.

As to defendants' actions prior to the denial of their *pro se*
requests, these were not the kind of "disruptive" actions that warranted
denial on that basis alone. We are aware of the occasions prior to the
*pro se* ruling when defendants interrupted the pre-trial hearing
without obtaining the court's prior leave. However, most of the
interruptions stemmed from defendants' confusion over the exclusion of
the public from the pre-trial hearing, a matter that had been arranged
at the pre-trial conference in which defendants had not participated,
and which was subject to reasonably prompt clarification without
repetition.

Thus, during Sister Malone's testimony, in which she inquired of the
court the reasons for the exclusion of the public, appellant Dougherty
interrupted to observe that he thought the courtroom was large enough to
accommodate the people who could be expected to attend. This followed by
moments an "interruption" by Mr. O'Rourke to make a request, joined in
by Sister Malone, that two of their relatives be permitted to observe
the progress of the hearing--- a request that the court granted.

None of the incidents can be characterized as "disruptive" in the sense
of evincing defendants' intent to upset or unreasonably delay the
hearing. Indeed to some extent the defendants, not trained in courtroom
decorum, had reason to suppose their behavior was within proper bounds.
At the hearing and during the early trial, Judge Pratt not only took
considerable care to explain his ruling on the *pro se* motions, but
also permitted the defendants to participate personally in jury
selection. The record also shows that Judge Pratt engaged defendants in
colloquies on various matters directly rather than through counsel. We
do not disapprove, we rather commend, Judge Pratt's willingness to
handle this case with some flexibility. The Supreme Court has emphasized
that one of the most important functions of criminal trials is, within
reason, to make plain to defendants and society at large that justice is
done in our courts,[^48] and Judge Pratt's approach likely had that
effect in this case. But the latitude previously granted to appellants
must be taken into account in appraising whether their later requests
manifest disruptive conduct.[^49] We cannot agree their pre-ruling
behavior can be considered as so "disruptive" as to constitute a
constructive, anticipatory waiver of a fundamental right.

E. *Application of the Doctrine of Harmless Error*

The Government finally contends that, assuming *arguendo* error in the
denial of *pro se* defense, reversal as inappropriate because no
prejudice resulted. We may assume, without deciding, that the harmless
error doctrine --- either in its ordinary formulation, or the more
refined "harmless constitutional error" version[^50] --- applies even in
cases involving denial of a fundamental statutory right approximating or
equalling the rights expressly stated in the Constitution. But we do not
think it applicable to this case.

The principal characteristic of "harmless error" doctrine is its
"result-orientation." Its normal operation is in cases where the
challenged error concerns a right given the defendant in order to permit
his defense to operate at maximum competence[^51] or to insulate him
from the effects of suspect evidence.[^52] In such cases there is reason
to consider whether claimed error is harmless because it plainly did not
affect the result adversely to defendant, for then the reason for the
right lapses.

Courts have recognized a measure of result-orientation in the right of
*pro se* representation. The Second Circuit, for example, perceives a
basis for the *pro se* right in the need not to force a defendant to
accept a lawyer in whom he has little confidence. Without such
confidence, lawyer-client communication is likely to be unsatisfactory
and "defendant may be better off representing himself," United States ex
rel. Maldonado v. Denno, *supra,* 348 F.2d at 15.

However, a salient aspect of the *pro se* right, in our view, is
directed to considerations distinct from the objective of achieving what
would be the best result in the litigation from a lawyer's point of
view. As the Supreme Court said in Adams v. United States ex rel.
McCann, *supra,* 317 U.S. at 279, 63 S.Ct. at 241, the "right to
dispense with a lawyer's help \.... rest\[s\] on considerations that go
to the substance of an accused's position before the law." It is
designed to safeguard the dignity and autonomy of those whose
circumstances or activities have thrust them involuntarily into the
criminal process. An accused has a fundamental right to confront his
accusers and his "country," to present himself and his position to the
jury not merely as a witness or through a "mouthpiece," but as a man on
trial who elects to plead his own cause. He is not obliged to seek what
counsel would record as a victory but what he sees as tantamount to
condemnation or doubt rather than vindication. A defendant has the moral
right to stand alone in his hour of trial. The denial of that right is
not to be redeemed through the prior estimate of someone else that the
practical position of the defendant will be enhanced through
representation by another, or the subsequent conclusion that defendant's
practical position has not been disadvantaged.

In guaranteeing counsel for the accused, the Sixth Amendment conferred a
right for the benefit of the accused. As implemented by Congress, this
right is not an imperative requirement that may be thrust upon him when
in his judgment, as a person without impaired mental capacity, it is
against his interest. Even if the defendant will likely lose the case
anyway, he has the right --- -as he suffers whatever consequences there
may be --- to the knowledge that it was the claim that he put forward
that was considered and rejected, and to the knowledge that in our free
society, devoted to the ideal of individual worth, he was not deprived
of his free will to make his own choice, in his hour of trial, to handle
his own case.[^53]

In the case at bar defendants believed they would be vindicated by their
peers by presenting their positions without law-trained counsel as
intermediary. They may or may not be right about the relative
effectiveness of a lawyer's presentation of their case. Ordinarily
repr.e-sentation by an attorney has structure and clarity that enables a
jury to better understand defendants' positions. Presentation of a case
*pro se* will often be artless and confusing. Yet the normal
disadvantage of confusion may be offset by the enhanced intensity and
appearance of greater sincerity of a defendant's presentation.[^54]

While we cannot apply the doctrine of "harmless error" in case of denial
of right of *pro se* representation on the ground that this would likely
have resulted in the same verdict as counseled representation, a
different question arises as to whether the overall format of the trial
was such, in terms of the latitude given to the defendants, that they in
effect had the substance though not the form of *pro se* representation.

This is a closer question, for as we have noted the judge made a
painstaking effort to take some account of defendants' positions in the
courtroom, and indeed gave permission to defendants to make brief
opening statements and to testify informally in narrative fashion.

In the last analysis, the judge's efforts did not suffice to dissipate
the erroneous denial of *pro se* representation. The court's indulgence
of defendants undoubtedly appeared as exactly that, a matter of grace
--- as something "extra" given to them beyond their due rights --- which
undercuts the objective of preserving defendants' personal autonomy and
responsibility in the courtroom. The format provided by the judge
allowed for brief opening statements by defendants not as representing
themselves, as they had a right to appear, but as a supplement to the
counsel appointed to represent them. The denial of the defendants' right
to make closing statements removed them from the place of responsibility
at the climax of the trial--- when they would be summing up their
positions in a context of a summing up by prosecution counsel.
Presentation of closing statements by the defendants was originally
promised and then taken away because of their disruptions. But the vast
bulk of the incidents cited in the Government's brief as such
disruptions --- 81 out of 89 --- were essentially colloquies in which
the defendants were asserting their *pro se* rights. And except for the
eruption as to the Vietnam war "issue," the other incidents were
relatively minor in character. But the abiding difficulty remains ---
that one cannot fairly reason backward, from the conduct of a defendant
at a trial where he was denied the right to represent himself, to what
his conduct would have been if at the outset the trial judge recognized
that right and at the same time clarified the responsibilities of
representation.

In finding error because of the denial of the *pro se* right we are not
unmindful of the fact that this trial presented Judge Pratt with
difficult problems, and that in many respects his conduct of the trial
reflected a commendable approach, a humane and flexible spirit that
would have served, if the right of self-representation had been granted,
to curb unwelcome consequences of that right.[^55] If it had not been
for that threshold error, the trial would have had a different
character. In view, however, of both the quality of, and limitations on,
the permissions granted to defendants, we cannot say that the procedure
followed was the equivalent of according the right of
self-representation that was erroneously denied at the outset.

III\. *The Issue of Jury Nullification*

Our reference to the "intensity" factor underlying the pro *se* right
should not be understood as embracing the principle of "nullification"
proffered by appellants. They say that the jury has a well-recognized
prerogative to disregard the instructions of the court even as to
matters of law, and that they accordingly have the legal right that the
jury be informed of its power. We turn to this matter in order to define
the nature of the new trial permitted by our mandate.

There has evolved in the Anglo-American system an undoubted jury
prerogative-in-fact, derived from • its power to bring in a general
verdict of not guilty in a criminal case, that is not reversible by the
court. The power of the courts to punish jurors for corrupt or incorrect
verdicts, which persisted after the medieval system of attaint by
another jury became obsolete, was repudiated in 1670 when Bushell's
Case, 124 Eng.Rep. 1006 (C.P. 1670) discharged the jurors who had
acquitted William Penn of unlawful assembly. Juries in civil cases
became subject to the control of ordering a new trial; no comparable
control evolved for acquittals in criminal cases.

The pages of history shine on instances of the jury's exercise of its
prerogative to disregard uncontradicted evidence and instructions of the
judge. Most often commended are the 18th century acquittal of Peter
Zenger of seditious libel, on the plea of Andrew Hamilton, and the 19th
century acquittals in prosecutions under the fugitive slave law. The
values involved drop a notch when the liberty vindicated by the verdict
relates to the defendant's shooting of his wife's paramour, or purchase
during Prohibition of alcoholic beverages.[^56]

Even the notable Dean Pound commented in 1910 on positive aspects of
"such jury lawlessness."[^57] These observations of history and
philosophy are underscored and illuminated, in terms of the current
place of the jury in the American system of justice, by the empirical
information and critical insights and analyses blended so felicitously
in H. Kalven and H. Zeisel, The American Jury.[^58]

Reflective opinions upholding the necessity for the jury as a protection
against arbitrary action, such as prose-cutorial abuse of power, stress
fundamental features like the jury *"common* sense judgment" and
assurance of "community participation in the determination of guilt or
innocence." [^59] Human fraility being what it is, a prosecutor disposed
by unworthy motives could likely establish some basis in fact for
bringing charges against anyone he wants to book, but the jury system
operates in fact, (see note 33) so that the jury will not convict when
they empathize with the defendant, as when the offense is one they see
themselves as likely to commit, or consider generally acceptable or
condonable under the mores of the community.

The existence of an unreviewable and unreversible power in the jury, to
acquit in disregard of the instructions on the law given by the trial
judge, has for many years co-existed with legal practice and precedent
upholding instructions to the jury that they are required to follow the
instructions of the court on all matters of law. There were different
soundings in colonial days and the early days of our Republic. We are
aware of the number and variety of expressions at that time from
respected sources --- John Adams; Alexander Hamilton; prominent judges
--- that jurors had a duty to find a verdict according to their own
conscience, though in opposition to the direction of the court; that
their power signified a right; that, they were judges both of law and of
fact in a criminal case, and not bound by the opinion of the court.[^60]

The rulings did not run all one way, but rather precipitated "a number
of classic exchanges on the freedom and obligations of the criminal
jury."[^61] This was, indeed, one of the points of clash between the
contending forces staking out the direction of the government of the
newly established Republic, a direction resolved in political terms by
reforming but sustaining the status of the courts, without radical
change.[^62] As the distrust of judges appointed and removable by the
king receded, there came increasing acceptance that under a republic the
protection of citizens lay not in recognizing the right of each jury to
make its own law, but in following democratic processes for changing the
law.

The crucial legal ruling came in United States v. Battiste, 2 Sum. 240,
Fed.Cas. No. 14,545 (C.C.D.Mass. 1835). Justice Story's strong opinion
supported the conception that the jury's function lay in accepting the
law given to it by the court and applying that law to the facts. This
considered ruling of an influential jurist won increasing acceptance in
the nation. The youthful passion for independence accommodated itself to
the reality that the former rebels were now in control of their own
destiny, that the practical needs of stability and sound growth
outweighed the abstraction of centrifugal philosophy, and that the
judges in the courts, were not the colonial appointees projecting
royalist patronage and influence but were themselves part and parcel of
the nation's intellectual mainstream, subject to the checks of the
common law tradition and professional opinion, and capable, in Roscoe
Pound's words, of providing "true judicial justice" standing in contrast
with the colonial experience.[^63]

The tide was turned by *Battiste,* but there were cross-currents. At
mid-century the country was still influenced by the precepts of
Jacksonian democracy, which spurred demands for direct selection of
judges by the people through elections, and distrust of the judge-made
common law which enhanced the movement for codification reform. But by
the end of the century, even the most prominent state landmarks had been
toppled ;[^64] and the Supreme Court settled the matter for the Federal
courts in Sparf v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 102, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39
L.Ed. 343 (1895) after exhaustive review in both majority and dissenting
opinions. The jury's role was respected as significant and wholesome,
but it was not to be given instructions that articulated a right to do
whatever it willed. The old rule survives today only as a singular
relic.[^65]

The breadth of the continuing prerogative of the jury, however,
perseveres, as appears from the rulings permitting inconsistent
verdicts. These reflect, in the words of Justice Holmes, an
acknowledgment that "the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the
teeth of both law and facts,"[^66] or as Judge Learned Hand said: "We
interpret the acquittal as no more than their assumption of a power
which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed
through lenity." [^67]

Since the jury's prerogative of lenity, again in Learned Hand's words
*(supra,* note 34) introduces a "slack into the enforcement of law,
tempering its rigor by the mollifying influence of current ethical
conventions," it is only just, say appellants, that the jurors be so
told. It is unjust to withhold information on the jury power of
"nullification," since conscientious jurors may come, ironically, to
abide by their oath as jurors to render verdicts offensive to their
individual conscience, to defer to an assumption of necessity that is
contrary to reality.

This so-called right of jury nullification is put forward in the name of
liberty and democracy, but its. explicit avowal risks the ultimate logic
of anarchy. This is the concern voiced by Judge Sobeloff in United
States v. Moylan, 417 F.2d 1002, 1009 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397
U.S. 910, 90 S.Ct. 908, 25 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970):

> To encourage individuals to make their own determinations as to which
> laws they will obey and which they will permit themselves as a matter
> of conscience to disobey is to invite chaos. No legal system could
> long survive if it gave every individual the option of disregarding

> as appellants claim, but inevitably anarchic.

• The statement that avowal of the jury's prerogative runs the risk of
anarchy, represents, in all likelihood, the habit of thought of
philosophy and logic, rather than the prediction of the social
scientist. But if the statement contains an element of hyperbole, the
existence of risk and danger, of significant magnitude, cannot be
gainsaid. In contrast, the advocates of jury "nullification" apparently
assume that the articulation of the jury's power will not extend its use
or extent, or will not do so significantly or obnoxiously. Can this
assumption fairly be made ? We know that a posted limit of 60 m.p.h.
produces factual speeds 10 or even 15 miles greater, with an
understanding all around that some "tolerance" is acceptable to the
authorities, assuming conditions warrant. But can it be supposed that
the speeds would stay substantially the same if the speed limit were
put: Drive as fast as you think appropriate, without the posted limit as
an anchor, a point of departure ?

Our jury system is a resultant of many vectors, some explicit, and some
rooted in tradition, continuity and general understanding without
express formulation. A constitution may be meaningful though it is
unwritten, as the British have proved for 900 years.

The jury system has worked out reasonably well overall, providing "play
in the joints" that imparts flexibility and avoid undue rigidity. An
equilibrium has evolved --- an often marvelous balance --- with the jury
acting as a "safety valve" for exceptional cases, without being a
wildcat or runaway institution. There is reason to believe that the
simultaneous achievement of modest jury equity and avoidance of
intolerable caprice depends on formal instructions that do not expressly
delineate a jury charter to carve out its own rules of law.[^68] We have
taken due and wry note that those whose writings[^69] acclaim and invoke
Roscoe Pound's 1910 recognition of the value of the jury as safety
valve, omit mention of the fact that in the same article he referred to
"the extreme decentralization that allows a local jury or even a. local
prosecutor to hold up instead of uphold the law of the state" as one of
the conditions that "too often result in a legal paralysis of legal
administration," [^70] that his writings of that period are expressly
concerned with the evils of the "extravagant powers" of juries,[^71] and
that in 1931 he joined the other distinguished members of the Wickersham
Commission in this comment :[^72]

> In a number of jurisdictions juries are made judges of the law in

The way the jury operates may be radically altered if there is
alteration in the way it is told to operate. The jury knows well enough
that its prerogative is not limited to the choices articulated in the
formal instructions of the court.[^73] The jury gets its understanding
as to the arrangements in the legal system from more than one voice.
There is the formal communication from the judge. There is the informal
communication from the total culture--- literature (novel, drama, film,
and television); current comment (newspapers, magazines and television);
conversation; and, of course, history and tradition. The totality of
input generally convey adequately enough the idea of prerogative, of
freedom in an occasional case to depart from what the judge says. Even
indicators that would on their face seem too weak to notice --- like the
fact that the judge tells the jury it must acquit (in case of reasonable
doubt) but never tells the jury in so many words that it must convict
--- are a meaningful part of the jury's total input. Law is a system,
and it is also a language, with secondary meanings that may be
unrecorded yet are part of its life.

When the legal system relegates the information of the jury's
prerogative to an essentially informal input, it is not being
duplicitous, chargeable with chicane and intent to deceive. The
limitation to informal input is, rather a governor to avoid excess: the
prerogative is reserved for the exceptional case, and the judge's
instruction is retained as a generally effective constraint. We
"recognize a constraint as obligatory upon us when we require not merely
reason to defend our rule departures, but damn good reason."[^74] The
practicalities of men, machinery and rules point up the danger of
articulating discretion to depart from a rule, that the breach will be
more often and casually invoked. We cannot gainsay that occasionally
jurors uninstructed as to the prerogative may feel themselves compelled
to the point of rigidity.[^75] The danger of the excess rigidity that
may now. occasionally exist is not as great as the danger of removing
the boundaries of constraint provided by the announced rules.

We should also note the inter-relation of the unanimity requirement for
petit juries, which was applicable to this trial, and is still the
general rule though no longer constitutionally required for state
courts.[^76] This is an additional reason--- a material consideration,
though neither a necessary nor sufficient condition--- to brake the
wheels of those who would tell the petit jurors they are to determine
the rules of law, either directly or by telling them they are free to
disregard the judge's statement of the rules. . The democratic principle
would not be furthered, as proponents of jury nullification claim, it
would be dis-served by investing in a jury that must be unanimous the
function not merely of determining facts, hard enough for like-minded
resolution, but of determining the rules of law.

Rules of law or justice involve choice of values and ordering of
objectives for which unanimity is unlikely in any society, or group
representing the society, especially a society as diverse in cultures
and interests as ours. To seek unity out of diversity, under the
national motto, there must be a procedure for decision by vote of a
majority or prescribed plurality --- in accordance with democratic
philosophy. To assign the role of mini-legislature to the various petit
juries, who must hang if not unanimous, exposes criminal law and
administration to paralysis, and to a deadlock that betrays rather than
furthers the assumptions of viable democracy.

Moreover, to compel a juror involuntarily assigned to jury duty to
assume the burdens of mini-legislator or judge, as is implicit in the
doctrine of nullification, is to put untoward strains on the jury
system. It is one thing for a juror to know that the law condemns, but
he has a factual power of lenity. To tell him expressly of a
nullification prerogative, however, is to inform him, in effect, that it
is he who fashions the rule that condemns. That is an overwhelming
responsibility, an extreme burden for the jurors' psyche. And it is not
inappropriate to add that a juror called upon for an involuntary public
service is entitled to the protection, when he takes action that he
knows is right, but also knows is unpopular, either in the community at
large or in his own particular grouping, that he can fairly put it to
friends and neighbors that he was merely following the instructions of
the court.

In the last analysis, our rejection of the request for jury
nullification doctrine is a recognition that there are times when logic
is not the only or even best guide to sound conduct of government. For
machines, one can indulge the person who likes to tinker in pursuit of
fine tuning. When men and judicial machinery are involved, one must
attend to the many and complex mechanisms and reasons that lead men to
change their conduct --- when they know they are being studied; when
they are told of the consequences of their conduct; and when conduct
exercised with restraint as an unwritten exception is expressly
presented as a legitimate option.

What makes for health as an occasional medicine would be disastrous as a
daily diet. The fact that there is widespread existence of the jury's
prerogative, and approval of its existence as a "necessary counter to
casehardened judges and arbitrary prosecutors," [^77] does not establish
as an imperative that the jury must be informed by the judge of that
power. On the contrary, it is pragmatically useful to structure ,
instructions in such wise that the jury must feel strongly about the
values involved in the case, so strongly that it must itself identify
the case as establishing a call of high conscience,[^78] and must
independently initiate and undertake an act in contravention of the
established instructions. This requirement of independent jury
conception confines the happening of the lawless jury to the occasional
instance that does not violate, and viewed as an exception may even
enhance, the over-all normative effect of the rule of law. An explicit
instruction to a jury conveys an implied approval that runs the risk of
degrading the legal structure requisite for true freedom, for an ordered
liberty that protects against anarchy as well as tyranny.

Finally, we are aware that the denial of defendants' request for a
nullification instruction will be considered by them to negative some,
or perhaps most, of the value of the right of *pro se* representation
which we have recognized. This point could be answered in terms of
logic: The right of self-representation is given for reasons recognized
by the law, and cannot be a springboard to establish the validity of
other advantages or conditions that lie in its tactical wake. Thus, a
defendant's ability to present his demeanor and often even a kind of
testimony, without exposure to impeachment or cross-examination, may be
a tactical consequence of *pro se* representation, and even a moving
cause of its invocation, but this is not to say it is an objective of
the law. But defendants' position merits a more spacious answer, that
lies outside the domain of formal logic. It is this. The jury system
provides flexibility for the consideration of interests of justice
outside the\' formal rules of law. This embraces whatever extra the
defendant conveys by personal representation, whether through demeanor
or sincerity of justification. But it is subject to the overriding
consideration that what is tolerable or even desirable as an informal,
self-initiated exception, harbors grave dangers to the system if it is
opened to expansion and intensification through incorporation in the
judge's instruction.

IV\. *The Jury Instructions*

Finally, defendants assert that one segment of the charge to the jury,
set forth in the margin,[^79] was coercive, tantamount to a directed
verdict of guilty, and outside the proper scope of a judicial
instruction.

For the most part, defendants' real complaint seems to be that the court
stated the law applicable to the case. There is no contention --- apart
from the jury nullification claim, which we have rejected --- that the
charge was inaccurate as a statement of the applicable law. If a judge
is to instruct the jury on the ultimate facts that are material under
the law, he may properly advise the jury of what matters brought forward
by defendants are not material under the applicable rule of law --- as
surely as he may charge that voluntary intoxication is no defense to a
charge of second degree murder. Since it is the essence of the judicial
function to declare the applicable law, it follows that the mere
declaration of the law cannot be held outside the judicial function.
This is tautological, but it is often the part of wisdom to be able to
recognize which propositions are true tautologies. The jury were not
told they must bring in a guilty verdict nor was there the kind of
language or conduct, going beyond a declaration of the applicable law,
that has in other cases [^80] been held coercive, and an imroper
departure from the role of the judge.

\* \* \*

The judgment must be reversed, for the reasons stated in part II of this
opinion, and the case remanded for new trial, if the Government be so
advised, in accordance with parts III and IV.

So ordered.

BAZELON, Chief Judge,

concurring in part and dissenting in part:

I concur in the Court's discussion of the statutory right of
self-representation in criminal cases. In view of our holding that the
statutory right is "unqualified," our decision need not rest on the
asserted constitutional right to proceed *pro se.* I emphasize, however,
that my concurrence reflects no retreat from the position I expressed
thirteen years ago in Brown v. United States, 105 U.S. App.D.C. 77, 84,
264 F.2d 363, 370 (1959) (en banc) (dissenting opinion). I believed
then, and I believe today, that the sixth amendment guarantees a
defendant the right to act on his own behalf in resisting a criminal
prosecution.

My disagreement with the Court concerns the issue of jury nullification.
As the Court's opinion clearly acknowledges, there can be no doubt that
the jury has "an unreviewable and unreversible power \* \* \* to acquit
in disregard of the instructions on the law given by the trial judge \*
\* \*." Majority opinion at 1132. More important, the Court apparently
concedes --- although in somewhat grudging terms --- that the power of
nullification is a "necessary counter to case-hardened judges and
arbitrary prosecutors," [^81] 2and that exercise of the power may, in at
least some instances, "enhance, the over-all normative effect of the
rule of law." *Id.* at 1137. We could not withhold that concession
without scoffing at the rationale that underlies the right to jury trial
in criminal cases,[^82] and belittling some of the most legendary
episodes in our political and jurisprudential history.[^83]

The sticking point, however, is whether or not the jury should be told
of its power to nullify the law in a particular case. Here, the trial
judge not only denied a requested instruction on nullification, but also
barred defense counsel from raising the issue in argument before the
jury. The majority affirms that ruling. I see no justification for, and
considerable harm in, this deliberate lack of candor.

At trial, the defendants made no effort to deny that they had committed
the acts charged. Their defense was designed to persuade the jury that
it would be unconscionable to convict them of violating a statute whose
general validity and applicability they did not challenge. An
instruction on nullification --- or at least some argument to the jury
on that issue --- was, therefore, the linchpin of the defense.

At the outset it is important to recognize that the trial judge was not
simply neutral on the question of nullification. His instruction, set
out in part in the margin,[^84] emphatically denied the existence of a
"legal defense" based on "sincere religious motives" or a belief that
action was justified by "some higher law." That charge was not directly
inconsistent with the theory of jury nullification. Nullification is not
a "defense" recognized by law, but rather a mechanism that permits a
jury, as community conscience, to disregard the strict requirements of
law where it finds that those requirements cannot justly be applied in a
particular case. Yet the impact of the judge's instruction, whatever his
intention, was almost surely to discourage the jury from measuring the
de-

fendants' action against community concepts of blameworthiness.

Thus, we are left with a doctrine that may "enhance the over-all
normative effect of the rule of law," but, at the same time, one that
must not only be concealed from the jury, but also effectively condemned
in the jury's presence. Plainly, the justification for this
sleight-of-hand lies in a fear that an occasionally noble doctrine will,
if acknowledged, often be put to ignoble and abusive purposes --- or, to
borrow the Court's phrase, will "run the risk of anarchy." Majority
opinion at 1134. A breakdown of the legal order is not a result I would
knowingly encourage or enjoy. But the question cannot be resolved, at
least at this stage of the argument, by asking if we are for or against
anarchy, or if we are willing to tolerate a little less law and order so
that we can permit a little more jury nullification. No matter how
horrible the effect feared by the Court, the validity of its reasoning
depends on the existence of a demonstrable connection between the
alleged cause (a jury nullification instruction or argument to the jury
on that issue) and that effect. I am unable to see a connection.

To be sure, there are abusive purposes, discussed below, to which the
doctrine might be put. The Court assumes that these abuses are most
likely to occur if the doctrine is formally described to the jury by
argument or instruction. That assumption, it should be clear, does not
rest on any proposition of logic. It is nothing more or less than a
prediction of how jurors will react to the judge's instruction or
argument by counsel. And since we have no empirical data to measure the
validity of the prediction, we must rely on our own rough judgments of
its plausibility.

The Court reasons that a jury uninformed of its power to nullify will
invoke that power only where it "feel\[s\] strongly about the values
involved in the case, so strongly that it \[will\] itself identify the
case as establishing a call of high conscience \* \* Majority opinion at
1136. In other words, the spontaneous and unsolicited act of
nullification is thought less likely, on the whole, to reflect bias and
a perverse sense of values than the act of nullification carried out by
a jury carefully instructed on its power and responsibility.

It seems substantially more plausible to me to assume that the very
opposite is true. The juror motivated by prejudice seems to me more
likely to make spontaneous use of the power to nullify, and more likely
to disregard the judge's exposition of the normally controlling legal
standards. The conscientious juror, who could make a careful effort to
consider the blameworthiness of the defendant's action in light of
prevailing community values, is the one most likely to obey the judge's
admonition that the jury enforce strict principles of law.

Moreover, if it were true that nullification which arises out of
ignorance is in some sense more worthy than nullification which arises
out of knowledge, the Court would have to go much further. For under the
Court's assumption, the harm does not arise because a jury is *told* of
its power to disregard the law, but because it *knows* of its power.
Logically construed, the Court's opinion would seem to require the
disqualification at voir dire of any prospective juror who admitted to
knowledge of the doctrine. By excluding jurors with knowledge of the
doctrine the Court could insure that its invocation would be
spontaneous. And yet, far from requiring the exclusion of jurors who are
aware of the power, the Court takes comfort in the fact that informal
communication to the jury "generally convey \[s\] adequately enough the
idea of prerogative, of freedom in an occasional case to depart from
what the judge says." Majority opinion at 1135. One cannot, it seems to
me, have the argument both ways. If, as the Court appears to concede,
awareness is preferable to ignorance, then I simply do not understand
the justification for relying on a haphazard process of informal
communication whose effectiveness is likely to depend, to a large
extent, on whether or not any of the jurors are so well-educated and
astute that they are able to receive the message. If the jury should
know of its power to disregard the law, then the power should be
explicitly described by instruction of the court or argument of counsel.

My own view rests on the premise that nullification can and should serve
an important function in the criminal process. I do not see it as a
doctrine that exists only because we lack the power to punish jurors who
refuse to enforce the law or to re-prosecute a defendant whose acquittal
cannot be justified in the strict terms of law. The doctrine permits the
jury to bring to bear on the criminal process a sense of fairness and
particularized justice. The drafters of legal rules cannot anticipate
and take account of every case where a defendant's conduct is "unlawful"
but not blameworthy, any more than they can draw a bold line to mark the
boundary between an accident and negligence. It is the jury --- as
spokesman for the community's sense of values --- that must explore that
subtle and elusive boundary.

Admittedly, the concept of blameworthiness does not often receive
explicit recognition in the criminal process. But it comes very close to
breaking through the surface in cases where the responsibility defense
is raised, *see* United States v. Brawner, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 1, at 62,
471 F.2d 969, at 1030 (1972) (en banc)„ (separate opinion); United
States v. Bennett, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 364, 368-370, 460 F.2d 872, 876-878
(1972); United States v. Eichberg, 142 U.S.App. D.C. 110, 113, 439 F.2d
620, 623 (1971) (concurring opinion), and it is implicit in every case
where criminal sanctions are imposed. More than twenty-five years ago
this Court recognized that "\[o\]ur collective conscience does not allow
punishment where it cannot impose blame." [^85] And the Supreme Court,
in a well-known opinion by Justice Jackson, has pointed out that

> courts of various jurisdictions, and for the purposes of different
> offenses, have devised working formulae, if not scientific ones, for
> the instruction of juries around such terms as "felonious intent,"
> "criminal intent," "malice aforethought," "guilty knowledge,"
> "fraudulent intent," "wilfulness," "scienter," to denote guilty
> knowledge, or *"mens rea,"* to signify an evil purpose or mental
> culpability. By use or combination of these various tokens, they have
> sought to *protect those who were not blameworthy in mind from
> conviction of infamous common-law* crimes.

The very essence of the jury's function is its role as spokesman for the
community conscience in determining whether or not blame can be
imposed.[^86]

I do not see any reason to assume that jurors will make rampantly
abusive use of their power. Trust in the jury is, after all, one of the
cornerstones of our entire criminal jurisprudence, and if that trust is
without foundation we must re-examine a great deal more than just the
nullification doctrine. Nevertheless, some abuse can be anticipated. If
a jury refuses to apply strictly the controlling principles of law, it
may --- in conflict with values shared by the larger community ---
convict a defendant because of prejudice against him, or acquit a
defendant because of sympathy for him and prejudice against his victim.
Our fear of unjust conviction is plainly understandable. But it is hard
for me to see how a nullification instruction could enhance the
likelihood of that result. The instruction would speak in terms of
acquittal, not conviction, and it would provide no comfort to a juror
determined to convict a defendant in defiance of the law or the facts of
the case. Indeed, unless the, jurors *ignored* the nullification
instruction they could not convict on the grounds of prejudice alone.
Does the judge's recitation of the instruction increase the likelihood
that the jury will ignore the limitation that lies at its heart ? I
hardly think so.

As for the problem of unjust acquittal, it is important to recognize the
strong internal check that constrains the jury's willingness to acquit.
Where defendants seem dangerous, juries are unlikely to exercise their
nullification power, whether or not an explicit instruction is offered.
Of course, that check will not prevent the acquittal of a defendant who
may be blameworthy and dangerous except in the jaundiced eyes of a jury
motivated by a perverse and sectarian sense of values. But whether a
nullification instruction would make such acquittals more common is
problematical, if not entirely inconceivable. In any case, the real
problem in this situation is not the nullification doctrine, but the
values and prejudice that prompt the acquittal.[^87] And the solution is
not to condemn the nullification power, but to spotlight the prejudice
and parochial values that underlie the verdict in the hope that public
outcry will force a re-examination of those values, and deter their
implementation in subsequent cases. Surely nothing is gained by the
pretense that the jurors lack the power to nullify, since that pretense
deprives them of the opportunity to hear the very instruction that might
compel them to confront their responsibility.

One often-cited abuse of the nullification power is the acquittal by
bigoted juries of whites who commit crimes (lynching, for example)
against blacks. That repellent practice cannot be directly arrested
without jeopardizing important constitutional protections --- the double
jeopardy bar and the jury's power of nullification. But the revulsion
and sense of shame fostered by that practice fueled the civil rights
movement, which in turn made possible the enactment of major civil
rights legislation. That same movement spurred on the revitalization of
the equal protection clause and, in particular, the recognition of the
right to be tried before a jury selected without bias.[^88] The lessons
we learned from these abuses helped to create a climate in which such
abuses could not so easily thrive.

Moreover, it is not only the abuses of nullification that can inform our
understanding of the community's values and standards of
blameworthiness. The noble uses of the power --- the uses that "enhance
the over-all normative effect of the rule of law"- --- also provide an
important input to our evaluation of the substantive standards of the
criminal law. The reluctance of juries to hold defendants responsible
for unmistakable violations of the prohibition laws told us much about
the morality of those laws and about the "criminality" of the conduct
they proscribed. And the same can be said of the acquittals returned
under the fugitive slave law as well as contemporary gaming and liquor
laws.[^89] A doctrine that can provide us with such critical insights
should not be driven underground.

On remand the trial judge should grant defendants' request for a
nullification instruction. At the very least,[^90] I would require the
trial court to permit defendants to argue the question before the jury.
But it is not at all clear that defendants would prevail even with the
aid of an instruction or argument. After all, this case is significantly
different from the classic, exalted cases where juries historically
invoked the power to nullify. Here, the defendants have no quarrel with
the general validity of the law under which they have been charged. They
did not simply refuse to obey a government edict that they considered
illegal, and whose illegality they expected to demonstrate in a judicial
proceeding. Rather, they attempted to protest government action by
interfering with others --- specifically, the Dow Chemical Company. This
is a distinction which could and should be explored in argument before
the jury. If revulsion against the war in Southeast Asia has reached a
point where a jury would be unwilling to convict a defendant for
commission of the acts alleged here, we would be far better advised to
ponder the implications of that result than to spend our time devising
stratagems which let us pretend that the power of nullification does not
even exist.

ADAMS, Circuit Judge:

This case presents several difficult and subtle issues. Their resolution
requires a sensitive understanding of human dignity, American legal and
political history, and the interrelationship of those factors with the
present criminal justice system, for it is this system that ensures that
all persons may peacefully pursue their interests without undue
interference from others.

Here, the defendants, by interrupting the business of a large chemical
company, attempted to publicize their dissenting views regarding the
morality of the American involvement in the Vietnam War. It is apparent
that the defendants attempted to exploit their criminal trial by using
it as a platform for further exposition of their beliefs, and to rely on
their moral position as a defense of criminal charges lodged against
them. In furtherance of their efforts to transform what would otherwise
be an ordinary criminal trial into a "political" fray, defendants wished
to represent themselves, to deviate from the usual mode of conducting a
criminal trial, and to argue to the jury that although they were in
violation of the applicable statutes, they should be acquitted because
their actions were morally justified.

The rulings of the district court regarding (a) the defendants' motions
to proceed pro se, (b) the defendants' right to have the court charge
the jury as to the nullification issue, and (c) the content of the
charge as actually given provide the foundation of this appeal.

In addressing these questions, some of which are to a large extent as
philosophical as they are legal, the Court of Appeals is at some
disadvantage --- especially with regard to self representation --- in
evaluating the district court's action from the cold record, divorced
from the climate of the time when the trial took place. We must be
mindful that the events in question here --- defendants' criminal acts
as well as the trial itself--- occurred during a period of passionate
and at times bitter political dissent. Several so-called "political"
trials, including those of Dr. Benjamin Spock, the Catonsville Nine, and
the Chicago Seven, occurred prior to this proceeding. In particular, it
is significant that this trial closely followed that of the Chicago
Seven, a trial wracked with violent disruptions when the defendants
there challenged the underlying structure of the criminal justice system
as we know it today.

In the context of what was transpiring in the judicial process in 1968
and 1969, the trial judge here was faced with a formidable task. On one
hand, he had to preserve the judicial atmosphere vital in criminal
proceedings to assure that both the Government and the defendants
received a fair trial on the merits. The judge could not help but be
aware that as a society we believe that an orderly, adversary trial by
jury is a most efficacious means of arriving at the truth of the matters
into which the court is inquiring. On the other hand, he had to take
account of the asserted rights of the defendants to present themselves
as moral persons --- possessed with dignity and freedom of spirit,
attributes upon which our system of Government was founded and built ---
as they sought to be acquittéd of their crimes. In evaluating whether
the trial judge erred, we must be cognizant of the delicate balance he
had to strike between ordered tranquility and America's irrepressible
desire for liberty.. Only if the court unduly weighted the scales
against the defendants, either by his application of the facts of this
case to the rules governing his actions or by his interpretation of the
controlling law, may we reverse the convictions.

The apposite law, in my judgment, is accurately set forth in Judge
Leventhal's opinion. Specifically, I concur in his holding that
defendants have a statutory right to proceed pro se in a federal
criminal trial, and that, in this case, it is not necessary to decide
the question in Constitutional terms.[^91] I also concur in the
conclusion that the right to proceed pro se is waivable, either
expressly or constructively, for example, by untimely assertion or by
disruptive behavior. However, I disagree with Judge Leventhal's factual
conclusion that the defendant's behavior here did not amount to a
constructive waiver of the pro se right. Because I do not consider that
the trial judge violated this right of the defendants, it is not
necessary to decide whether such a violation may nevertheless be
considered harmless error.

Since I would not reverse these convictions based on violation of
defendants' right to self-representation, I need not express an opinion
on the issues of jury nullification and the charge to the jury. With
regard to these latter questions, Judge Leventhal's statement of the law
is wholly acceptable.

A careful review of the transcript of the proceedings with respect to
defendants' motions to dispense with counsel indicates that the
defendants on many occasions interrupted the proceeding for various
reasons, despite the fact they were represented by counsel at that time.
The printed record cannot inform us whether such interruptions were
violent, impolite, contemptuous, or made with an impertinent or
sarcastic tone of voice. However more than once the judge had to
threaten intervention by the marshals to impress upon defendants that
they had to obey orders of the court to be seated. At other times, the
language used by the defendants appeared to be disrespectful or even
rude. That the trial judge appeared to tolerate many instances of this
type of behavior, and even engaged in discourse with defendants, does
not prove that he acquiesced in such extraordinary tactics, but rather
indicates that he was at-témpting to preserve some sort of order.

Although it may be argued that there are some things in the judicial
process more important than decorum in a courtroom, we are not faced
with such perplexing alternatives here. Dissent is a healthy
manifestation of the freedoms we as a nation profess and cherish. And a
criminal trial might serve as the seed around which a point of view may
crystallize. But a courtroom is not an arena in which dissention,
particularly of a disruptive nature, may supplant, or even take
precedence over, the task of administering justice.

As mentioned earlier, it is not without significance that this trial
occurred at a time when the judicial system was being subjected to great
stress because of the actions of some defendants and attorneys. The
trial judge was surely aware of the publicity that attended the
commission of the charged crimes, and the notoriety the trial itself
would achieve. To paraphrase a slogan of the "new left", he did not have
to be a weatherman to téll which way the wind was blowing.

Although a gale may have been raging in the courts at that time,
challenging the very assumptions upon which our system of justice is
based, a counter-current was also evident. Only a month after the trial
here in question, the Supreme Court delivered its opinion in Illinois v.
Allen, *supra.* There, the various justices gave notice that they were
aware of the storm and the damage it could wreak, and that they were
determined that the judiciary have the ability to steer clear of the
danger.[^92]

Certainly, what transpired here, coupled with the real threat of further
disruption, was sufficient to alert the trial judge to what could be
expected if the motions to dispense with counsel were granted. Thus, his
determination that to grant the motions would turn the trial into a
shambles does not appear to be unreasonable.

Accordingly, I would conclude that defendants had, by their conduct,
waived their right to proceed pro se, and would affirm the rulings by
the district court that the defendants in these circumstances had to be
represented by counsel. Based on this and on Judge Leventhal's opinion
with regard to nullification and the charge, I would affirm the
judgments of convictions.

On Appellee's Petition for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En
Banc

LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge:

The Government's petition for rehearing leads us to amplify our opinion.

1\. The Government argues that defendant's right to defend himself at
trial is not absolute, and cites the Standards Relating to the Function
of the Trial Judge (ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, §
6.6, Tentative Draft, June 1972, at 85), which states in pertinent
commentary:

> Moreover, the interest of the public in an orderly, rational trial is
> entitled to consideration in determining the defendant's right to
> appear *pro se. See* United States v. Bentvena, 319 F.2d 916, 937 (2d
> Cir. 1963); Butler v. United States, 317 F.2d 249, 258 (8th Cir.
> 1963).

We agree with this statement to the extent set forth in our opinion,
including *e. g.,* that a defendant's disruption may waive his right to
pro se representation. We note that both *Butler,* cited in our opinion
(at fn. 14), and *Bentvena,* are cases involving requests for pro se
representation made after the commencement of trial --- a situation
that, as our opinion points out, is entirely different from that of a
pro se claim made timely before trial begins. Indeed in *Bentvena* the
court stated, 319 F.2d at 938:

> One charged with crime has an absolute right to do without an attorney
> and conduct his own defense (28 U.S. C. § 1654), but that is quite
> different from the right to discharge counsel after trial has begun.
> This latter right is a qualified one.

2\. The petition for rehearing submits:

> With particular regard to the value of an orderly trial, we believe
> that a trial judge should have authority to engraft reasonable
> conditions on the exercise of a defendant's right of
> self-representation.

It suffices to say that this case did not present a situation where the
trial judge sought to prescribe reasonable conditions to accompany pro
se representation. We do not have before us whether, or in what manner,
a trial judge could prescribe conditions for the purpose of assuring a
trial without disruption --- to carry out the implied premise that there
will be reasonable cooperation from the defendants, as opposed to any
manipulation of the trial process so as to interfere with fair
administration of justice.

3\. The Government stresses a contention that the court's opinion
improperly bypasses the doctrine of harmless error. Apart from the
matters set forth in the opinion already filed, we observe that if the
conventional doctrine of harmless error is applied, it will in effect
undercut the right of pro. se representation, since rarely if ever can
there be a showing of prejudice in terms of result from the conduct of a
trial by counsel. There is no requirement of a showing of prejudice when
counsel has been denied. A like rule is applicable, although for
different reasons, when pro se representation is denied.

4\. The Government objects that our opinion means that any denial of pro
se representation will per se require reversal. It does not require
reversal in a case where the trial judgé makes findings of defendants'
prior disruption, or refusal to assure reasonable cooperation, or
inability to waive counsel, etc. The effort to cope with the problem of
disruptions necessarily puts an obligation on the trial judge [^93] to
stake out the considerations explicitly and with care. In the absence of
some exposition of an appropriate basis for denying his right, the
defendant is entitled to a trial at which he is accorded his right to
represent himself.

Petition for rehearing denied.

Bordenkircher v. Hayes

 

**\[ ... \]**

**Don BORDENKIRCHER, Superintendent, Kentucky State Penitentiary,
Petitioner,**

**v.**

**Paul Lewis HAYES.**

**\[ ... \]**

Argued Nov. 9, 1977.

Decided Jan. 18, 1978.

**\[ ... \]**

           Mr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.

          The question in this case is whether the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a state prosecutor carries out
a threat made during plea negotiations to reindict the accused on more
serious charges if he does not plead guilty to the offense with which he
was originally charged.

I

          The respondent, Paul Lewis Hayes, was indicted by a **\[ ...
\]** grand jury on a charge of uttering a forged instrument in the
amount of \$88.30, an offense then punishable by a term of 2 to 10 years
in prison. **\[ ... \]** After arraignment, Hayes, his retained counsel,
and the Commonwealth\'s Attorney met in the presence of the Clerk of the
Court to discuss a possible plea agreement. During these conferences the
prosecutor offered to recommend a sentence of five years in prison if
Hayes would plead guilty to the indictment. He also said that if Hayes
did not plead guilty and \"save\[d\] the court the inconvenience and
necessity of a trial,\" he would return to the grand jury to seek an
indictment under the Kentucky Habitual Criminal Act,^1^ **\[ ...
\]**repealed 1975), which would subject Hayes to a mandatory sentence of

**\[ ... \]**

life imprisonment by reason of his two prior felony convictions.^2^
Hayes chose not to plead guilty, and the prosecutor did obtain an
indictment charging him under the Habitual Criminal Act. It is not
disputed that the recidivist charge was fully justified by the evidence,
that the pros cutor was in possession of this evidence at the time of
the original indictment, and that Hayes\' refusal to plead guilty to the
original charge was what led to his indictment under the habitual
criminal statute.

          A jury found Hayes guilty on the principal charge of uttering
a forged instrument and, in a separate proceeding, further found that he
had twice before been convicted of felonies. As required by the habitual
offender statute, he was sentenced to a life term in the penitentiary.
**\[ ... \]**

IV

          This Court held in *North Carolina v. Pearce***\[ ... \]**,
that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \"requires that
vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his
first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a
new trial.\" **\[ ... \]**

            To punish a person because he has done what the law plainly
allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort**\[
... \]** and for an agent of the State to pursue a course of action
whose objective is to penalize a person\'s reliance on his legal rights
is \"patently unconstitutional.\" ***\[ ... \]*** But in the
\"give-and-take\" of plea bargaining, there is no such element of
punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or
reject the prosecution\'s offer.

          Plea bargaining flows from \"the mutuality of advantage\" to
defendants and prosecutors, each with his own reasons for wanting to
avoid trial. ***\[ ... \]***Defendants advised by competent counsel and
protected by other procedural safeguards are presumptively capable of
intelligent choice in response to prosecutorial persuasion**\[ ... \]**.
By hypothesis, the plea may have been induced by promises of a
recommendation of a lenient sentence or a reduction of charges, and thus
by fear of the possibility of a greater penalty upon conviction after a
trial. See ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of
Guilty § 3.1 (App. Draft 1968);

**\[ ... \]**

            While confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe
punishment clearly may have a \"discouraging effect on the defendant\'s
assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices
\[is\] an inevitable\"---and permissible---\"attribute of any legitimate
system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\" ***\[
... \]*** It follows that, by tolerating and encouraging the negotiation
of pleas, this Court has necessarily accepted as constitutionally
legitimate the simple reality that the prosecutor\'s interest at the
bargaining table is to persuade the defendant to forgo his right to
plead not guilty.

**\[ ... \]** In our system, so long as the prosecutor has probable
cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by
statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to
file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely in his
discretion.^8^ Within the limits set by the legislature\'s
constitutionally valid definition of chargeable offenses, \"the
conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a
federal constitutional violation\" so long as \"the selection was
\[not\] deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race,
religion, or other arbitrary classification.\" ***\[ ... \]***To hold
that the prosecutor\'s desire to induce a guilty plea is an
\"unjustifiable standard,\" which, like race or religion,

Page 365

may play no part in his charging decision, would contradict the very
premises that underlie the concept of plea bargaining itself. Moreover,
a rigid constitutional rule that would prohibit a prosecutor from acting
forthrightly in his dealings with the defense could only invite
unhealthy subterfuge that would drive the practice of plea bargaining
back into the shadows from which it has so recently emerged. **\[ ...
\]**

          There is no doubt that the breadth of discretion that our
country\'s legal system vests in prosecuting attorneys carries with it
the potential for both individual and institutional abuse.^9^ And broad
though that discretion may be, there are undoubtedly constitutional
limits upon its exercise. We hold only that the course of conduct
engaged in by the prosecutor in this case, which no more than openly
presented the defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing
trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution,
did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

**\[ ... \]**

           Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr.
Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

          It might be argued that it really makes little difference how
this case, now that it is here, is decided. The Court\'s holding gives
plea bargaining full sway despite vindictiveness. A contrary result,
however, merely would prompt the aggressive prosecutor to bring the
greater charge initially in every case, and only thereafter to bargain.
The consequences to the accused would still be adverse, for then he
would bargain against a greater charge, face the likelihood of increased
bail, and run the risk that the court would be less inclined to accept a
bargained plea. Nonetheless, it is far preferable to hold the
prosecution to the charge it was originally content to bring and to
justify in the eyes of its public.^2^

           Mr. Justice POWELL, dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

          It seems to me that the question to be asked under the
circumstances is whether the prosecutor reasonably might have charged
respondent under the Habitual Criminal Act in the first place. The
deference that courts properly accord the

**\[ ... \]**

exercise of a prosecutor\'s discretion perhaps would foreclose judicial
criticism if the prosecutor originally had sought an indictment under
that Act, as unreasonable as it would have seemed.^2^ But here the
prosecutor evidently made a reasonable, responsible judgment not to
subject an individual to a mandatory life sentence when his only new
offense had societal implications as limited as those accompanying the
uttering of a single \$88 forged check and when the circumstances of his
prior convictions confirmed the inappropriateness of applying the
habitual criminal statute.^3^ I think it may be inferred that the
prosecutor himself deemed it unreasonable and not in the public interest
to put this defendant in jeopardy of a sentence of life imprisonment.

   **\[ ... \]**

          The plea-bargaining process, as recognized by this Court, is
essential to the functioning of the criminal-justice system. It normally
affords genuine benefits to defendants as well as to society. And if the
system is to work effectively, prosecutors must be accorded the widest
discretion, within constitutional limits, in conducting bargaining. **\[
... \]** In this case, the prosecutor\'s actions denied respondent due

**\[ ... \]**

process because their admitted purpose was to discourage and then to
penalize with unique severity his exercise of constitutional rights.
Implementation of a strategy calculated solely to deter the exercise of
constitutional rights is not a constitutionally permissible exercise of
discretion. **\[ ... \]**

^1.\ While\ cross-examining\ Hayes\ during\ the\ subsequent\ trial\ proceedings\ the\ prosecutor\ described\ the\ plea\ offer\ in\ the\ following\ language:^

\"Isn\'t it a fact that I told you at that time \[the initial bargaining
session\] if you did not intend to plead guilty to five years for this
charge and . . . save the court the inconvenience and necessity of a
trial and taking up this time that I intended to return to the grand
jury and ask them to indict you based upon these prior felony
convictions?\" Tr. 194.

^2.^ At the time of Hayes\' trial the statute provided that \"\[a\]ny
person convicted a . . . third time of felony . . . shall be confined in
the penitentiary during his life.\" Ky.Rev.Stat. § 431.190 (1973)
(repealed 1975). That statute has been replaced by Ky.Rev.Stat. §
532.080 (Supp. 1977) under which Hayes would have been sentenced to, at
most, an indeterminate term of 10 to 20 years. § 532.080(6)(b). In
addition, under the new statute a previous conviction is a basis for
enhanced sentencing only if a prison term of one year or more was
imposed, the sentence or probation was completed within five years of
the present offense, and the offender was over the age of 18 when the
offense was committed. At least one of Hayes\' prior convictions did not
meet these conditions. See n. 3, *infra*.

**^\[\ ...\ \]^**

^8.^ This case does not involve the constitutional implications of a
prosecutor\'s offer during plea bargaining of adverse or lenient
treatment for some person *other* than the accused, see ALI Model Code
of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Commentary to § 350.3, pp. 614-615 (1975),
which might pose a greater danger of inducing a false guilty plea by
skewing the assessment of the risks a defendant must consider. Cf.
*Brady v. United States*, 397 U.S. 742, 758, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1474, 25
L.Ed.2d 747.

^9.^ This potential has led to many recommendations that the
prosecutor\'s discretion should be controlled by means of either
internal or external guidelines. See ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment
Procedure for Criminal Justice §§ 350.3(2)-(3) (1975); ABA Project on
Standards for Criminal Justice, The Prosecution Function §§ 2.5, 3.9
(App. Draft 1971); Abrahms, Internal Policy: Guiding the Exercise of
Prosecutorial Discretion, 19 UCLA L.Rev. 1 (1971).

**^\[\ ...\ \]^**

^2.^ That prosecutors, without saying so, may sometimes bring charges
more serious than they think appropriate for the ultimate disposition of
a case, in order to gain bargaining leverage with a defendant, does not
add support to today\'s decision, for this Court, in its approval of the
advantages to be gained from plea negotiations, has never openly
sanctioned such deliberate overcharging or taken such a cynical view of
the bargaining process. See *North Carolina v. Alford*, 400 U.S. 25, 91
S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); *Santobello v. New York*, 404 U.S.
257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Normally, of course, it is
impossible to show that this is what the prosecutor is doing, and the
courts necessarily have deferred to the prosecutor\'s exercise of
discretion in initial charging decisions.

Even if overcharging is to be sanctioned, there are strong reasons of
fairness why the charges should be presented at the beginning of the
bargaining process, rather than as a filliped threat at the end. First,
it means that a prosecutor is required to reach a charging decision
without

any knowledge of the particular defendant\'s willingness to plead
guilty; hence the defendant who truly believes himself to be innocent,
and wishes for that reason to go to trial, is not likely to be subject
to quite such a devastating gamble since the prosecutor has fixed the
incentives for the average case.

Second, it is healthful to keep charging practices visible to the
general public, so that political bodies can judge whether the policy
being followed is a fair one. Visibility is enhanced if the prosecutor
is required to lay his cards on the table with an indictment of public
record at the beginning of the bargaining process, rather than making
use of unrecorded verbal warnings of more serious indictments yet to
come.

Finally, I would question whether it is fair to pressure defendants to
plead guilty by threat of reindictment on an enhanced charge for the
same conduct when the defendant has no way of knowing whether the
prosecutor would indeed be entitled to bring him to trial on the
enhanced charge. Here, though there is no dispute that respondent met
the then-current definition of a habitual offender under Kentucky law,
it is conceivable that a properly instructed Kentucky grand jury, in
response to the same considerations that ultimately moved the Kentucky
Legislature to amend the habitual offender statute, would have refused
to subject respondent to such an onerous penalty for his forgery charge.
There is no indication in the record that, once the new indictment was
obtained, respondent was gi en another chance to plead guilty to the
forged check charge in exchange for a five-year sentence.

Note the case of Brady v. U.S., cited in footnote 9, which basically
says that even prosecutorial threats of upcharging, capital case
charging, etc. do not render a plea \"involuntary.\" This is still good

Some Review First: Example Based on US v. X-Citement Video

 

Title 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (1988 ed. and Supp. V) provides, in relevant
part:

\(a\) Any person who---

\(1\) knowingly transports or ships in interstate or foreign commerce by
any means including by computer or mails, any visual depiction, if---

\(A\) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and

\(B\) such visual depiction is of such conduct;

\(2\) knowingly receives, or distributes, any visual depiction that has
been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign
commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so
shipped or transported, by any means including by computer, or knowingly
reproduces any visual depiction for distribution in interstate or
foreign commerce or through the mails, if---

\(A\) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and

\(B\) such visual depiction is of such conduct;

\....

shall be punished \[by up to 10 years in prison\].

Must the government prove that the defendant knew that the images he
sent through the mails were of minors engaging in sexual activity? Or is
it sufficient to show that she knew that she was shipping visual
depictions and that those depictions were in fact of minors engaged in
sexual activity?

*See*, *United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.*, 513 U.S. 64 (1994)
(concluding that, although "the most grammatical reading of the statute"
would apply strict liability on that point, public policy and
legislative history suggest that was not Congress's intent).

Commonwealth v. Carroll

 

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

Appeal, No. 130

**194 A.2d 911**

**412 Pa. 525**

**COMMONWEALTH of Pennsylvania**\
**v.**\
**Donald D. CARROLL, Jr., Appellant.**

**Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.**

**Nov. 12, 1963.**

**\[ ... \]**

BELL, Chief Justice.

The defendant, Carroll, pleaded guilty generally to an indictment
charging him with the murder of his wife, and was tried by a Judge
without a jury **\[ ... \]**. That Court found him guilty of first
degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Following argument
and denial of motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial,
defendant took this appeal. The only questions involved are thus stated
by the appellant:

\(1\) \'Does not the evidence sustain a conviction no higher than murder
in the second degree?

\(2\) \'Does not the evidence of defendant\'s good character, together
with the testimony of medical experts, including the psychiatrist for
the Behavior Clinic of Allegheny County, that the homicide was not
premeditated or intentional,
require[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X378a486c23a64ab8bbca6546db495c8b51541ed)
the Court below **\[ ... \]** to fix the degree of guilt of defendant no
higher than murder in the second degree?\'

The defendant married the deceased in 1955, when he was serving in the
Army in California. **\[ ... \]**Defendant was a hard worker, earned a
substantial salary and bore a very good reputation among his neighbors.

In 1958, decedent-wife suffered a fractured skull while attempting to
leave defendant\'s car in the course of an argument. Allegedly this
contributed to her mental disorder which was later diagnosed as a
schizoid personality type. In 1959 she underwent psychiatric treatment
at the Mental Hygiene Clinic in Aberdeen, Maryland. She complained of
nervousness and told the examining doctor \'I feel like hurting my
children.\' This sentiment sometimes took the form of sadistic
\'discipline\' toward their very young children. Nevertheless, upon her
discharge from the Clinic, the doctors considered her much improved.
With this background we come to the immediate events of the crime.

In January, 1962, defendant was selected to attend an electronics school
in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for nine days. His wife greeted this
news with violent argument. Immediately prior to his departure for
Winston-Salem, at the suggestion and request of his wife, he put a
loaded .22 calibre pistol on the **\[ ... \]**window sill at the head of
their common bed, so that she would feel safe. On the evening of January
16, 1962, defendant returned home and told his wife that he had been
temporarily assigned to teach at a school in Chambersburg, which would
necessitate his absence from home four nights out of seven for a ten
**\[ ... \]** week period. A violent and protracted argument ensued at
the dinner table and continued until four o\'clock in the morning.

Defendant\'s own statement after his arrest details the final moments
before the crime: \'We went into the bedroom a little before 3 o\'clock
on Wednesday morning where we continued to argue in short bursts.
Generally she laid with her back to me facing the wall in bed and would
just talk over her shoulder to me. I became angry and more angry
especially what she was saying about my kids and myself, and sometime
between 3 and 4 o\'clock in the morning I remembered the gun on the
window sill over my head. I think she had dozed off. I reached up and
grabbed the pistol and brought it down and shot her twice in the back of
the
head.\'[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xa905cc547ce780aa79cff8d7e36669fb2634d67)

Defendant\'s testimony at the trial elaborated this theme. He started to
think about the children, \'seeing my older son\'s feet what happened to
them. I could see the bruises on him and Michael\'s chin was split open,
four stitches. I didn\'t know what to do. I wanted to help my boys.
Sometime in there she said something in there, she called me some kind
of name. I kept thinking of this. During this time I either thought or
felt\--I thought of the gun, just thought of the gun. I am not sure
whether I felt my hand move toward the gun\--I saw my hand move, the
next thing\--the only thing I can recollect after that is right after
**\[ ... \]** the shots or right during the shots I saw the gun in my
hand just pointed at my wife\'s head. She was still lying on her
back\--I mean her side. I could smell the gunpowder and I could hear
something\--it sounded like running water. I didn\'t know what it was at
first, didn\'t realize what I\'d done at first. Then I smelled it. I
smelled blood before. \* \* \*\'

\'Q. At the time you shot her, Donald, were you fully aware and intend
to do what you did?

\'A. I don\'t know positively. All I remember hearing was two shots and
feeling myself go cold all of a sudden.\'

Shortly thereafter defendant wrapped his wife\'s body in a blanket,
spread and sheets, tied them on with a piece of plastic clothesline and
took her down to the cellar. He tried to clean up as well as he could.
That night he took his wife\'s body, wrapped in a blanket with a rug
over it to a desolate place near a trash dump. He then took the children
to his parents\' home in Magnolia, New Jersey. He was arrested the next
Monday in Chambersburg where he had gone to his teaching assignment.

\'Murder\', \* \* \* \'is defined as an **\[ ... \]** unlawful killing
of another with malice aforethought, express or implied.\' The
legislature divided murder into two classifications, murder in the first
degree and murder in the second degree; and provided that (1) all murder
perpetrated by poison or lying in wait; or by any other kind of wilful,
deliberate \[and\] premeditated killing, or any murder which shall be
**\[ ... \]** committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate
certain specified felonies \[arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or
kidnapping\],[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xea7e9533bd53bf75eeccc5c5d1b9f513bdaa0cf)
is murder in the first degree and (2) every other kind of murder is
murder in the second degree: Act of 1939, June 24,
supra.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X09ca349a116ad767ae1daf2c1e3de0e5742fa72)

\"Malice express or implied is \[the hallmark\] the criterion and
absolutely essential ingredient of murder. Malice in its legal sense
exists not only where there is a particular ill will, but also whenever
there is a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, wanton conduct,
cruelty, recklessness of consequences and a mind regardless of social
duty. Legal malice may be inferred and found from the attending
circumstances. \[Malice is present if the defendant had an intent to do
the deceased serious bodily harm: Commonwealth v. Drum, supra; **\[ ...
\]**

The specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute in a
nonfelony murder, murder in the first degree, may be found from a
defendant\'s words or conduct or from the attendant circumstances
together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, and may be inferred
from the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body
of another human being**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**It is well settled that a jury or a trial Court can believe
all or a part of or none of a defendant\'s statements, confessions or
testimony, or the testimony of any witness: Commonwealth v. Melton, 406
Pa. 343**\[ ... \]**.

It we consider only the evidence which is favorable to the Commonwealth,
it is without the slightest doubt sufficient in law to prove first
degree. However, even if we believe all of defendant\'s statements and
testimony, there is no doubt that this killing constituted murder in the
first degree. Defendant first urges that there was insufficient time for
premeditation in the light of his good reputation. This is based on an
isolated and oft repeated statement in Commonwealth v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9,
16, that \"no time is too short for a wicked man to frame in his mind
the scheme of murder.\" Defendant argues that, conversely, a long time
is necessary to find premeditation in a \'good man.\' We find no merit
in defendant\'s analogy or contention. As Chief Justice MAXEY
appropriately and correctly said in Commonwealth v. Earnest, **\[ ...
\]**\'Whether the intention to kill and the killing, that is, the
premeditation and the fatal act, were within a brief space of time or a
long space of time is immaterial if the killing was in fact intentional,
wilful, deliberate and premeditated. \* \* \* As Justice Agnew said in
Com. v. Drum: \'The law fixes upon **\[ ... \]** no length of time as
necessary to form the intention to kill, but leaves the existence of a
fully formed intent as a fact to be determined by the jury, from all the
facts and circumstances in the evidence.\'\'

Defendant further contends that the time and place of the crime, the
enormous difficulty of removing and concealing the body, and the obvious
lack of an escape plan, militate against and make a finding of
premeditation legally impossible. This is a \'jury argument\'; it is
clear as crystal that such circumstances do not negate premeditation.
This contention of defendant is likewise clearly devoid of merit.

Defendant\'s most earnestly pressed contention is that the
psychiatrist\'s opinion of what defendant\'s state of mind must have
been and was at the time of the crime, clearly establishes not only the
lack but also the legal impossibility of premeditation. Dr. Davis, a
psychiatrist of the Allegheny County Behavior Clinic, testified that
defendant was \'for a number of years \* \* \* passively going along
with a situation which he \* \* \* \[was\] not controlling and he \* \*
\* \[was\] not making any decisions, and finally a decision \* \* \*
\[was\] forced on him \* \* \*. He had left the military to take this
assignment, and he was averaging about nine thousand a year; he had a
good job. He knew that if he didn\'t accept this teaching assignment in
all probability he would be dismissed from the Government service, and
at his age and his special training he didn\'t know whether he would be
able to find employment. More critical to that was the fact that at this
point, as we understand it, his wife issued an ultimatum that if he went
and gave this training course she would leave him \* \* \*. He was so
dependent upon her he didn\'t want her to leave. He couldn\'t make up
his mind what to do. He was trapped \* \* \*.\'

The doctor then gave his opinion that \'rage\', \'desperation\', and
\'panic\' produced \'an impulsive automatic **\[ ... \]** reflex type of
homicide, \* \* \* as opposed to an intentional premeditated type of
homicide. \* \* \* Our feeling was that if this gun had fallen to the
floor he wouldn\'t have been able to pick it up and consummate that
homicide. And I think if he had to load the**\[ ... \]** gun he
wouldn\'t have done it. This is a matter of opinion, but this is our
opinion about it.\'

There are three answers to this contention. First, as we have
hereinbefore stated, neither a Judge nor a jury has to believe all or
any part of the testimony of the defendant or of any witness. Secondly,
the opinion of the psychiatrists was based to a large extent upon
statements made to them by the defendant, which need not be believed and
which are in some instances opposed by the facts themselves. Thirdly, a
psychiatrist\'s opinion of a defendant\'s impulse or lack of intent or
state of mind is, in this class of case, entitled to very little weight,
and this is especially so when defendant\'s own actions, or his
testimony or confession, or the facts themselves, belie the opinion.

**\[ ... \]**

While defendant makes no contention that he was insane at the commission
of the murder or at any time, what this Court said in Commonwealth v.
Tyrrell**\[ ... \]** is equally appropriate here:

\'Defendant\'s psychiatrist did not testify that the defendant was
insane. What he did say was that because defendant\'s wife frequently
picked on him and just before the killing insulted or goaded him,
defendant **\[ ... \]** had an emotional impulse to kill her which he
could not resist.

\'\* \* \* society would be almost completely unprotected from criminals
if the **\[ ... \]** law permitted a blind or irresistible impulse or
inability to control one\'s self, to excuse or justify a murder or to
reduce it from first degree to second degree. In the times in which we
are living, nearly every normal adult human being has moments or hours
or days or longer periods when he or she is depressed and disturbed with
resultant emotional upset feelings and so-called blind impulses; and the
young especially have many uncontrolled emotions every day which are
euphemistically called irresistible impulses. The Courts of Justice
should not abdicate their function and duty of determining criminal
responsibility to the psychiatrist. In such event, the test will differ
not only with each psychiatrist but also with the prevailing psychiatric
winds of the moment. \"\* \* \* Only a short time ago that concept \[of
irresistible impulse\] was emphatically presented as an example of the
\'uniform\' opinion of psychiatrists on criminal responsibility; and yet
today, \'irresistible impulse\' is rejected by most psychiatrists as
unsound \* \* \*\'**\[ ... \]**

Just as the Courts cannot abdicate to the psychiatrists the task of
determining criminal responsibility in law, so also they cannot remit to
psychiatrists the right to determine the intent or the state of mind of
an accused at the time of the commission of a homicide.

CLECKLEY, Justice:

The defendant, Dale Edward Guthrie, appeals the January, 1994, jury
verdict of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, finding him guilty of
first degree murder. In May of 1994, the defendant was sentenced to
serve a life sentence with a recommendation of mercy. **\[ ... \]**

I.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

It is undisputed that on the evening of February 12, 1993, the defendant
removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed his coworker, Steven Todd
Farley, in the neck and killed him. The two men worked together as
dishwashers at Danny's Rib House in Nitro and got along well together
before this incident. On the night of the killing, the victim, his
brother, Tracy Farley, and James Gibson were joking around while working
in the kitchen of the restaurant. The victim was poking fun at the
defendant who appeared to be in a bad mood. He told the defendant to
"lighten up" and snapped him with a dishtowel several times. Apparently,
the victim had no idea he was upsetting the defendant very much. The
dishtowel flipped the defendant on the nose and he became enraged.

The defendant removed his gloves and started toward the victim. Mr.
Farley, still teasing, said: "Ooo, he's taking his gloves off." The
defendant then pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the victim in
the neck. He also stabbed Mr. Farley in the arm as he fell to the floor.
Mr. Farley looked up and cried: "Man, I was just kidding around." The
defendant responded: "Well, man, you should have never hit me in my face
" **\[ ... \]**

It is also undisputed that the defendant suffers from a host of
psychiatric problems. He experiences up to two panic attacks daily and
had received treatment for them at the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Huntington for more than a year preceding the killing. He suffers
from chronic depression (dysthymic disorder), an obsession with his nose
(body dysmorphic disorder), and borderline personality disorder. The
defendant's father shed some light on his nose fixation. He stated that
dozens of times a day the defendant stared in the mirror and turned his
head back and forth to look at his nose. His father estimated that 50
percent of the time he observed his son he was looking at his nose. The
defendant repeatedly asked for assurances that his nose was not too big.
This obsession began when he was approximately seventeen years old. The
defendant was twenty-nine years old at the time of trial.

The defendant testified he suffered a panic attack immediately preceding
the stabbing. He described the attack as "intense"; he felt a lot of
pressure and his heart beat rapidly. In contrast to the boisterous
atmosphere in the kitchen that evening, the defendant was quiet and kept
to himself. He stated that Mr. Farley kept irritating him that night.
The defendant could not understand why Mr. Farley was picking on him
because he had never done that before. Even at trial, the defendant did
not comprehend his utter overreaction to the situation. In hindsight,
the defendant believed the better decision would have been to punch out
on his time card and quit over the incident. However, all the witnesses
related that the defendant was in no way attacked, as he perceived it,
but that Mr. Farley was playing around. The defendant could not bring
himself to tell the other workers to leave him alone or inform them
about his panic attacks.

**\[ ... \]**

The principal question before us under this assignment of error is
whether our instructions on murder when given together deprive a
criminal defendant of due process or are otherwise wrong and confusing.
**\[ ... \]**

State's Instruction No. 8**\[ ... \]** stated:

> "The Court instructs the jury that to constitute a willful, deliberate
> and premeditated killing, it is not necessary that the intention to
> kill should exist for any particular length of time prior to the
> actual killing; it is only necessary that such intention should have
> come into existence for the first time at the time of such killing, or
> at any time previously."

**\[ ... \]**

The linchpin of the problems that flow from these instructions is the
failure adequately to inform the jury of the difference between first
and second degree murder. Of particular concern is the lack of guidance
to the juiy as to what constitutes premeditation and the manner in which
the instructions infuse premeditation with the intent to kill.

**\[ ... \]**

While many jurisdictions do not favor the distinction between first and
second degree murder,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6ecf50de9a57e1749fd47205d08fdd90df32d0f) given the doctrine of
separation of powers, we do not have the judicial prerogative to abolish
the distinction between first and second degree murder and rewrite the
law of homicide for West Virginia; unless, of course, we were to declare
this classification a violation of due process and force the Legislature
to rewrite the law --- a bold stroke that we refuse to do. On the other
hand, we believe within the parameters of our current homicide statutes
the *Schrader* definition of premeditation and deliberation is
confusing, if not meaningless. To allow the State to prove premeditation
and deliberation by only showing that the intention came "into existence
for the first time at the time of such killing" completely eliminates
the distinction between the two degrees of murder. Hence, we feel
compelled in this case to attempt to make the dichotomy meaningful by
making some modifications to our homicide common law.

Premeditation and deliberation should be defined in a more careful, but
still general way to give juries both guidance and reasonable
discretion. Although premeditation and deliberation are not measured by
any particular period of time, there must be some period between the
formation of the intent to kill and the actual killing, which indicates
the killing is by prior calculation and design. As suggested by the
dissenting opinion in *Green v. State,* 1 Tenn.Crim.App. 719, 735**\[
... \]**(1970): "True, it is not necessary to prove premeditation
existed for any definite period of time. But it is necessary to prove
that it did exist." This means there must be an opportunity for some
reflection on the intention to kill after it is formed. The accused must
kill purposely after contemplating the intent to kill. Although an
elaborate plan or scheme to take te is not required, our Schrader's
notion of instantaneous premeditation and momentary deliberation is not
satisfactory for proof of first degree murder. In *Bullock v. United
States,* 74 App.D.C. 220, 221, **\[ ... \]**(1941), *cert. denied,* 317
U.S. 627**\[ ... \]**(1942), the court discussed the need to have some
appreciable time elapse between the intent to kill and the killing:

> "To speak of premeditation and deliberation which are instantaneous,
> or which take no appreciable time, is a contradiction in terms. It
> deprives the statutory requirement of all meaning and destroys the
> statutory distinction between first and second degree murder. At
> common law there were no degrees of murder. If the accused had no
> overwhelming provocation to kill, he was equally guilty whether he
> carried out his murderous intent at once or after mature reflection.
> Statutes like ours, \'which distinguish deliberate and premeditated
> murder from other murder, reflect a belief that one who meditates an
> intent to kill and then deliberately executes it is more dangerous,
> more culpable or less capable of reformation than one who kills on
> sudden impulse; or that the prospect of the death penalty is more
> likely to deter men from deliberate than from impulsive murder. The
> deliberate killer is guilty of first degree murder; the impulsive
> killer is not. The quoted part of the charge was therefore erroneous."

Thus, there must be some evidence that the defendant considered and
weighed his decision to kill in order for the State to establish
premeditation and deliberation under our first degree murder
statute.[**\[ ... \]**](#X41e02e5293304c14b0ee58ae00c15f416bdd743) This
is what**\[ ... \]**is meant by a ruthless, cold-blooded, calculating
killing. Any other intentional killing, by its spontaneous and
nonreflective nature, is second degree murder.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xea8f8e6879509463c54151706da3a88cc21b230)

**\[ ... \]***\[W\]e* agree with the defendant that the language in our
opinion in *Schrader* virtually eliminates the distinction in this State
between first and second degree murder, equating as it does
premeditation with the formation of the intent to kill. **\[ ... \]**

Notes & Questions (State v. Guthrie)

 

**Notes and Questions**

1\.    *The Case and its Aftermath*. Following Guthrie's second trial,
he was again convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in
prison with the possibility of parole. He then made a subsequent appeal
in 1997, which was denied by the Court. For information on the
procedural history of *Guthrie*, please see this
[*website*](https://law.justia.com/cases/west-virginia/supreme-court/2014/13-1201.html). 

Guthrie has been denied parole three times (2003, 2006, and 2009) since
becoming eligible. The National Organization of Parents of Murdered
Children, Inc. has been involved in Guthrie's parole denial. This
organization strives to "give survivors a sense of control, as well as a
positive outlet for the anger, frustration and disillusionment with the
criminal justice system." According to its
[*website*](https://pomc.org/), the organization allows parents of
homicide victims "to participate in the parole process by attempting to
keep murderers behind bars for their minimum sentence, thus protecting
society from potential repeat offenders."

2\.    *Changing the Facts.* What facts do you think indicated
premeditation or a lack of premeditation?

3*.     Mental Health and the Criminal Justice System*. As you read in
the *Guthrie* case, the defendant suffered "from a host of psychiatric
problems," including panic attacks, chronic depression, body dysmorphic
disorder, and borderline personality disorder. According to the
[*National Alliance on Mental
Illness*](https://www.nami.org/Advocacy/Policy-Priorities/Responding-to-Crises),
nearly 15% of men and 30% of women booked into jails live with serious
mental illness. Despite these large numbers, the vast majority of these
individuals are booked on nonviolent crimes. Once in jail, many
individuals are denied proper mental health treatment and end up getting
worse, instead of better. Considering that people experiencing a mental
health crisis are more likely to encounter police than receive medical
help, how do you think the criminal justice system could change to
better care for people experiencing mental health crises?

One
[*article*](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/05/28/using-courts-to-help-solve-the-mental-health-crisis/)
offers the solution of "mental health courts, \[which are\] a form of
collaborative court based on the highly successful drug court model that
provides services and treatments to participants while emphasizing
collaborative problem solving between all parties." While not a perfect
solution, it paves the way for a conversation amongst future lawyers
regarding how to create a better system.

Note: People v. Anderson

 

TW: Sexual Assault

 

### Note on *People v. Anderson*, 447 P.2d 942 (Cal. 1968)

The horrific facts of the case were as follows:\[1\]

When the police arrived at 7 p.m. the shades were down on all the
windows and the doors were locked. Defendant finally opened the front
door for one of the officers who arrested and handcuffed defendant. The
arresting officer testified that defendant was wearing slacks, no shirt
or shoes, and that there was no blood on him.

The arresting officer found Victoria\'s body on the floor near her bed.
He found defendant\'s blood-spotted shorts on a chair in the living
room, and a knife and defendant\'s socks, with blood encrusted on the
soles, in the master bedroom. The evidence established that the
victim\'s torn and bloodstained dress had been ripped from her, that her
clothes, including her panties out of which the crotch had been ripped,
were found in various rooms of the house, that there were bloody
footprints matching the size of the victim\'s leading from the master
bedroom to Victoria\'s room, and that there was blood in almost every
room including the kitchen, the floor of which appeared to have been
mopped.

The TV cameraman who covered the murder story for channel 11, the
officer who drove defendant to the police station, and the officer who
\"observed\" defendant for four hours at the station the night of
December 7, 1962, all testified that defendant did not appear
intoxicated. The officers who talked to defendant testified, however,
that they smelled alcohol on his breath; a blood test taken at 7:45 p.m.
indicated that the alcohol content in defendant\'s blood was .34
percent, which was more than necessary for an automobile driver to be
classified as \"under the influence.\"

Over 60 wounds, both severe and superficial, were found on Victoria\'s
body. The cuts extended over her entire body. Several of the wounds ...
were post mortem.

Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.
He argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to
support a first degree murder conviction and the State Supreme Court
agreed.

Given the presumption that an unjustified killing of a human being
constitutes murder of the second, rather than of the first, degree, and
the clear legislative intention to differentiate between first and
second degree murder, we must determine in any case of circumstantial
evidence whether the proof is such as will furnish a reasonable
foundation for an inference of premeditation and deliberation, or
whether it \"leaves only to conjecture and surmise the conclusion that
defendant either arrived at or carried out the intention to kill as the
result of a concurrence of deliberation and premeditation.\"

Thus we have held that in order for a killing with malice aforethought
to be first rather than second degree murder, \"\'\[t\]he intent to kill
must be \... formed upon a pre-existing reflection,\' \... \[and have\]
been the subject of actual deliberation or forethought \....\" We have
therefore held that \"\[a\] verdict of murder in the first degree \...
\[on a theory of a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing\] is
proper only if the slayer killed \'as a result of careful thought and
weighing of considerations; as a deliberate judgment or plan; carried on
cooly and steadily, \[especially\] according to a preconceived design.\'

The type of evidence which this court has found sufficient to sustain a
finding of premeditation and deliberation falls into three basic
categories: (1) facts about how and what defendant did prior to the
actual killing which show that the defendant was engaged in activity
directed toward, and explicable as intended to result in, the
killing\--what may be characterized as \"planning\" activity; (2) facts
about the defendant\'s prior relationship and/or conduct with the victim
from which the jury could reasonably infer a \"motive\" to kill the
victim, which inference of motive, together with facts of type (1) or
(3), would in turn support an inference that the killing was the result
of \"a pre-existing reflection\" and \"careful thought and weighing of
considerations\" rather than \"mere unconsidered or rash impulse hastily
executed\"; (3) facts about the nature of the killing from which the
jury could infer that the manner of killing was so particular and
exacting that the defendant must have intentionally killed according to
a \"preconceived design\" to take his victim\'s life in a particular way
for a \"reason\" which the jury can reasonably infer from facts of type
(1) or (2).

Applying this standard to the facts of Anderson, the Court was unable to
find sufficient facts from which a jury could conclude that Anderson
premeditated the killing. The Court concluded that the brutal and
senseless nature of the killing showed an absence of the kinds of facts
necessary to demonstrate motive, planning, or preconceived design.

Official Comment to Section 210.6

 

### Official Comment to MPC § 210.6

Prior reflection may reveal the uncertainties of a tortured conscience
rather than exceptional depravity. The very fact of a long internal
struggle may be evidence that the homicidal impulse was deeply
aberrational and far more the product of extraordinary circumstances
than a true reflection of the actor's normal character Thus, for
example, one suspects that most mercy killings are the consequence of
long and careful deliberation, but they are not especially appropriate
cases for imposition of capital punishment.

It also seems clear, moreover, that some purely impulsive murders will
present no extenuating circumstance. The suddenness of the killing may
simply reveal callousness so complete and depravity so extreme that no
hesitation is required.

State v. Forrest

 

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v. JOHN FORREST

321 N.C. 186

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

MEYER, Justice.

Defendant was convicted of the first-degree murder of his father, Clyde
Forrest. **\[ ... \]** the case was tried as a noncapital case, and
defendant was sentenced accordingly to life imprisonment. **\[ ... \]**

The facts of this case are essentially uncontested, and the evidence
presented at trial tended to show the following series of events. On 22
December 1985, defendant John Forrest admitted his critically ill
father, Clyde Forrest, Sr., to Moore Memorial Hospital. Defendant's
father, who had previously been hospitalized, was suffering from
numerous serious ailments, including severe heart disease, hypertension,
a thoracic aneurysm, numerous pulmonary emboli, and a peptic ulcer. By
the morning of 23 December 1985, his medical condition was determined to
be unbeatable and terminal. Accordingly, he was classified as "No Code,"
meaning that no extraordinary measures would be used to save his life,
and he was moved to a more comfortable room.

On 24 December 1985, defendant went to the hospital to visit his ailing
father. No other family members were present in his father's room when
he arrived. While one of the nurse's assistants was tending to his
father, defendant told her, "There is no need in doing that. He's
dying." She responded, "Well, I think he's better." The nurse's
assistant noticed that defendant was sniffing as though crying and that
he kept his hand in his pocket during their conversation. She
subsequently went to get the nurse.

When the nurse's assistant returned with the nurse, defendant once again
stated his belief that his father was dying. The nurse tried to comfort
defendant, telling him, "I don't think your father is as sick as you
think he is." Defendant, very upset, responded, "Go to hell. I've been
taking care of him for years. I'll take care of him." Defendant was then
left alone in the room with his father.

Alone at his father's bedside, defendant began to cry and to tell his
father how much he loved him. His father began to cough, emitting a
gurgling and rattling noise. Extremely upset, defendant pulled a small
pistol from his pants pocket, put it to his father's temple, and fired.
He subsequently fired three more times and walked out into the hospital
corridor, dropping the gun to the floor just outside his father's room.

Following the shooting, defendant, who was crying and upset, neither ran
nor threatened anyone. Moreover, he never denied shooting his father and
talked openly with law enforcement officials. Specifically, defendant
made the following oral statements: "You can't do anything to him now.
He's out of his suffering." "I killed my daddy." "He won't have to
suffer anymore." "I know they can burn me for it, but my dad will not
have to suffer anymore." "I know the doctors couldn't do it, but I
could." "I promised my dad I wouldn't let him suffer."

**\[ ... \]**Though defendant's father had been near death as a result
of his medical condition, the exact cause of the deceased's death was
determined to be the four point-blank bullet wounds to his head.
Defendant's pistol was a single-action .22-calibre five-shot revolver.
The weapon, which had to be cocked each time it was fired, contained
four empty shells and one live round.

At the close of the evidence, defendant's case was submitted to the jury
for one of four possible verdicts: first-degree murder, second-degree
murder, voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty. After a lengthy
deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder.
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In his second assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial
court committed reversible error in denying his motion for directed
verdict as to the first-degree murder charge. Specifically, defendant
argues that the trial court's submission of the first-degree murder
charge was improper because there was insufficient evidence of
premeditation and deliberation presented at trial. We do not agree**\[

***\[ ... \]***

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** Here, many of the circumstances that we have held
to establish a factual basis for a finding of premeditation and
deliberation are present. It is clear, for example, that the seriously
ill deceased did nothing to provoke defendant's action. Moreover, the
deceased was lying helpless in a hospital bed when defendant shot him
four separate times. In addition, defendant's revolver was a five-shot
single-action gun which had to be cocked each time before it could be
fired. Interestingly, although defendant testified that he always
carried the gun in his job as a truck driver, he was not working on the
day in question but carried the gun to the hospital nonetheless.

Most persuasive of all on the issue of premeditation and deliberation,
however, are defendant's own statements following the incident. Among
other things, defendant stated that he had thought about putting his
father out of his misery because he knew he was suffering. He stated
further that he had promised his father that he would not let him suffer
and that, though he did not think he could do it, he just could not
stand to see his father suffer any more. These statements, together with
the other circumstances mentioned above, make it clear that the trial
court did not err in submitting to the jury the issue of first-degree
murder based upon premeditation and deliberation. **\[ ... \]**

No error.

Chief Justice Exum Dissenting.

Almost all would agree that someone who kills because of a desire to end
a loved one's physical suffering caused by an illness which is both
terminal and incurable should not be deemed in law as culpable and
deserving of the same punishment as one who kills because of unmitigated
spite, hatred or ill will. **\[ ... \]**

The difference, legally, between the two kinds of killings hinges on the
element of malice, the former being without, and the latter with,
malice. The absence of malice, however, does not mean the killing is
justified or excused so as not to be unlawful; it means simply that the
killing is mitigated so as not to be murder but manslaughter. **\[ ...
\]**

**\[ ... \]** The trial court instructed that malice was "that condition
of mind that prompts a person to take the life of another intentionally
.. . without just cause, excuse or justification." **\[ ... \]** The
trial court should have added "and without mitigation."

**\[ ... \]**

For this error in the trial court's instructions, I vote to give
defendant a new trial.

**\[ ... \]**

Christiancy J.:

The prisoner was charged with an assault with intent to kill and murder
one Patrick Hunt. The evidence on the part of the prosecution was, that
the prisoner entered the saloon of one Michael Foley, in the village of
Houghton, where said Hunt was standing with several other persons; that
prisoner entered through a back door and by a back way leading to it, in
his shirt sleeves, in a state of great perspiration, and appearing to be
excited; **\[ ... \]**that as soon as the prisoner came up to where Hunt
was standing, he fired a pistol at Hunt, the charge of which took effect
upon the head of Hunt, in and through the left ear, causing a severe
wound thereon; by reason of which Hunt in a few moments fell to the
floor, was partially deprived of *his* sense of hearing in that ear, and
received a severe shock to his system which caused him to be confined to
his bed for about a week, **\[ ... \]**The prisoner offered evidence
tending to show an adulterous intercourse between his wife and Hunt on
the morning of the assault, and within less than half an hour previous;
that the prisoner saw them going into the woods together .about half an
hour before the assault; that on their coming out of the woods the
prisoner followed them immediately (evidence having already been given
that prisoner had followed them to the woods); that, on their coming out
of the woods, the prisoner .followed them and went after said Hunt into
the saloon, where, on his arrival, the assault was committed; that the
prisoner on his way to the saloon, a few minutes before entering it, was
met by a friend who informed him that Hunt and the prisoner's wife had
had sexual intercourse\" the day before in the woods. This evidence was
rejected by the Court, and the prisoner excepted. Was the evidence
properly rejected? This is the main question in the case, and its
decision must depend upon the question whether the proposed evidence
would have tended to reduce the killing --- had death ensued --- from
murder to manslaughter, **\[ ... \]**If the homicide --- in case death
had ensued --- would have been but manslaughter, then defendant could
not be guilty of the assault *with intent to* murder, but only of a
simple assault and battery. The question therefore involves essentially
the same principles as where evidence is offered for a similar purpose
in a prosecution for murder; except that, in some cases of murder, an
actual intention to kill need not exist; but in a prosecution for an
assault *with intent* to murder, the actual intention to kill must be
found, and that under circumstances which would make the killing murder.

Homicide, or the mere killing of one person by another, does not, of
itself, constitute murder; it may be murder, or manslaughter, .or
excusable or justifiable homicide, and therefore entirely innocent,
according to the circumstances, or the disposition or state of mind or
purpose, which induced the act. It is not, therefore, the act which
constitutes the offense, or determines its character; but the *quo*
animo, the disposition, or state of mind, with which it is done. *Actus
non facii reum nisi mens sit rea." People v Pond,* 8 *Mich.* 150.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**It is sufficient to say that, within the principle
of all the recognized definitions, the homicide must, in all ordinary
cases, have been committed with some degree of coolness and
deliberation, or, at least, under circumstances in which ordinary men,
or the average of men recognized as peaceable citizens, would not be
liable to have their reason clouded or obscured by passion; and the act-
must be prompted by, or the circumstances indicate that it sprung from,
a wicked, depraved or malignant mind **\[ ... \]**

But if the act of killing, though intentional, be committed under the
influence of passion or in heat of blood, produced by an adequate or
reasonable provocation, and before a reasonable time has elapsed for the
blood to cool and reason to resume its habitual control, and is the
result of the temporary excitement, by *which* the control of reason was
disturbed, *rather* than of any wickedness of heart or cruelty or
recklessness of disposition; then the law, out of indulgence to the
frailty of human nature, or. rather, in recognition of the laws upon
which human nature is constituted, very properly regards the offense as
of a less heinous character than murder, and gives it the designation of
manslaughter.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

The principle involved in the question, and which, I think, clearly
dedueible from the .majority of well considered cases, Avould seem to
suggest as the true general rule, that reason should, at the time of the
act, be disturbed or obscured by passion to an extent which *might
render* ordinary men, of fair average disposition*,* *liable* to act
rashly or without due deliberation or reflection, and from passion,
rather than judgment.

To the question, what shall be considered in law a reasonable or
adequate provocation for such a state of mind, so as to give to a
homicide, committed under its influence, the character of manslaughter;
on principle, the answer, as a general rule, must be, anything the
natural tendency of which would be to produce such a state of mind in
ordinary men, and which the jury are satisfied did produce it in the
case before them --- not such a provocation as must, by the laws of the
human mind, produce such an effect with the *certainty that physical
effects folíolo from physical causes;* for then the individual could
hardly be held morally accountable. Nor, on the other hand, must the
provocation, in every case, be held sufficient or reasonable, because
such a state of excitement has followed from it; for then, by habitual
and long continued indulgence of evil passions, a bad man might acquire
a claim to mitigation which would not be available to better men, and on
account of that very wickedness of heart which, in itself, constitutes
an aggravation both in morals and in law.

In determining whether the provocation is sufficient or reasonable,
*ordinary human* nature, or the average of men recognized as men of fair
average mind and disposition, should be taken as the standard ---
unless, indeed, the person whose guilt is in question be shown to have
some peculiar weakness of mind or infirmity of temper, not arising from
wickedness of heart or cruelty of disposition.

It is doubtless, in one sense, the province of the Court to define what,
in law, will constitute a reasonable or adequate provocation, but not, I
think, in ordinary cases, to determine whether the provocation proved in
the particular case is sufficient or reasonable. This is essentially a
question of fact, and to be decided with reference to the peculiar facts
of each particular case. **\[ ... \]***should* Besides the consideration
that the question is essentially one of fact, jurors, from the mode of
their selection, coming from the various classes and occupations of
society, and conversant with the practical affairs, of life, are, in my
opinion, much better qualified to judge of the sufficiency and tendency
of a given provocation, and much more likely to fix, with some degree of
accuracy, the standard of what constitutes the average of ordinary human
nature, than the Judge whose habits and course of life give him much
less experience of the workings of passion in the actual conflicts of
life.

The Judge, it is true, must, to some extent, assume to decide upon the
sufficiency of the alleged provocation, when the question arises upon
the admission of testimony; and when it is so clear as to admit of no
reasonable doubt upon any theory, that the alleged provocation could not
have had any tendency to produce such state of mind, in ordinary men, he
may properly exclude the evidence; but, if the alleged provocation be
such as to admit of any reasonable,doubt, whether it might not have had
such tendency, it is much safer, I think, and more in accordance with
principle, to let the evidence go to the jury under the proper
instructions. **\[ ... \]**

The same principles which govern, as to the extent to which the passions
must be excited and reason disturbed, apply with equal force to the time
during which its continuance may be recognized as a ground for
mitigating the homicide to the degree of manslaughter, or, in other
words, to the question of cooling time. This, like the provocation
itself, must depend upon the nature of man and the laws of the human
mind, as well as upon the nature and circumstances of the provocation,
the extent to which the passions have been aroused, and the fact,
whether the injury inflicted by the provocation is more or less
permanent or irreparable. The passion excited by a blow received in a
sudden quarrel, though perhaps equally violent for the moment, would be
likely much sooner to subside than if aroused by a rape committed upon a
sister or a daughter, or the discovery of an adulterous intercourse with
a wife; and no two cases of the latter kind would be likely to be
identical in all their circumstances of provocation. No precise time,
therefore, *in hours or* minutes, can be laid down by the Court, as a
rule of law, within which the passions *must he held* to have subsided
and reason to have resumed its control, without setting at defiance the
laws of man's nature, and ignoring the veryj principle on which
provocation and passion are allowed to be shown, at all, in mitigation
of the offense**\[ ... \]**it is a question of fact for tho jury; and
the Court can not take it from the jury by assuming to decide it as a
question of law, without confounding the respective provinces of the
Court and jury: **\[ ... \]**this, question of reasonable cooling time
was expressly held to be a question of fact for the jury. **\[ ... \]**

It remains only to apply these principles to the present ease. The
proposed evidence, in connection with what had already been given, would
have tended strongly to show the commission of adultery by Hunt with the
prisoner's wife, within half an hour before the assault; that the
prisoner saw them going to the woods together, under circumstances
calculated strongly to impress upon his mind the belief of the
adulterous purpose; that he followed after them to the woods; that Hunt
and the prisoner's wife were, not long after, seen coming from the
woods, and that the prisoner followed them, and went in hot pursuit
after Hunt to the saloon, and was informed by a friend on the way that
they, had committed adultery the day before in the woods. *I* can not
resist the conviction that this would have been sufficient evidence of
provocation to go to the jury, and from which, when taken in connection
with the excitement and "great perspiration" exhibited on entering the
saloon,\' the hasty manner in which he approached and fired the pistol
at Hunt, it would have been competent for the jury to find that the act
was committed in consequence of the passion excited by the provocation,
and in a state of mind which, within the principle already explained,
would have given to the homicide, had death ensued, the character of
manslaughter only. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** **\[ ... \]**I think, therefore, for the
several reasons stated, the evidence offered was erroneously rejected.

**\[ ... \]**

Martin Ch. J. and Campbell J. concurred.

Manning J.:

I differ from my brethren in this case. I think the evicence was
properly excluded. To make that manslaughter**\[ ... \]**which would
otherwise be murder, the provocation --- I am not speaking of its
sufficiency, but of the provocation itself--- must be given in the
presence of the person committing the homicide. The cause of the
provocation must occur in his presence. Park J. in *Regina v.* Fisher, 8
*C. & P.* 182, in speaking of the cause of provocation says, " In all
cases the party must see the act done." Any other rule in an offense so
grave as taking the life of a fellow being, in the heat of passion, I
fear would be more humane to the perpetrator than wise in its effects on
society. **\[ ... \]**It would, it seems to me, be extremely mischievous
to let passion engendered by suspicion, or by something one has heard,
enter into and determine the nature of a crime committed while under its
influence. The innocent as well as the guilty, or those who had not as
well as those who had given provocation, might be the sufferers. If it
be said that in such cases the giving of the provocation must be proved
or it would go for nothing; the answer is, that the law will not, and
should not permit the lives of the innocent to be exposed with the
guilty in this way, as it would do did it not require the cause of the
provocation to occur in the presence of the person committing the
homicide. **\[ ... \]**

I think the judgment should be affirmed.

*Judgment reversed,* *and new trial ordered.*

COLE, Judge.

In this case we are asked to reconsider whether the types of provocation
sufficient to mitigate the crime of murder to manslaughter should be
limited to the categories we have heretofore recognized, or whether the
sufficiency of the provocation should be decided by the factfinder on a
case-by-case basis. Specifically, we must determine whether words alone
are provocation adequate to justify a conviction of manslaughter rather
than one of second degree murder.

The Petitioner, Steven S. Girouard, and the deceased, Joyce M. Girouard,
had been married for about two months on October 28, 1987, the night of
Joyce's death. Both parties, who met while working in the same building,
were in the army. They married after having known each other for
approximately three months. The evidence at trial indicated that the
marriage was often tense and strained, and there was some evidence that
after marrying Steven, Joyce had resumed a relationship with her old
boyfriend, Wayne.

On the night of Joyce's death, Steven overheard her talking on the
telephone to her friend, whereupon she told the friend that she had
asked her first sergeant for a hardship discharge because her husband
did not love her anymore. Steven went into the living room where Joyce
was on the phone and asked her what she meant by her comments; she
responded, "nothing." Angered by her lack of response, Steven kicked
away the plate of food Joyce had in front of her. He then went to lie
down in the bedroom.

Joyce followed him into the bedroom, stepped up onto the bed and onto
Steven's back, pulled his hair and said, "What are you going to do, hit
me?" She continued to taunt him by saying, "I never did want to marry
you and you are a lousy fuck and you remind me of my dad." [^94] The
barrage of insults continued with her telling Steven that she wanted a
divorce, that the marriage had been a mistake and that she had never
wanted to marry him. She also told him she had seen his commanding
officer and filed charges against him for abuse. She then asked Steven,
"What are you going to do?" Receiving no response, she continued her
verbal attack. She added that she had filed charges against him in the
Judge Advocate General's Office (JAG) and that he would probably be
court martialed.[^95]

When she was through, Steven asked her if she had really done all those
things, and she responded in the affirmative. He left the bedroom with
his pillow in his arms and proceeded to the kitchen where he procured a
long handled kitchen knife. He returned to Joyce in the bedroom with the
knife behind the pillow. He testified that he was enraged and that he
kept waiting for Joyce to say she was kidding, but Joyce continued
talking. She said she had learned a lot from the marriage and that it
had been a mistake. She also told him she would remain in their
apartment after he moved out. When he questioned how she would afford
it, she told him she would claim her brain-damaged sister as a dependent
and have the sister move in. Joyce reiterated that the marriage was a
big mistake, that she did not love him and that the divorce would be
better for her.

After pausing for a moment, Joyce asked what Steven was going to do.
What he did was lunge at her with the kitchen knife he had hidden behind
the pillow and stab her 19 times. Realizing what he had done, he dropped
the knife and went to the bathroom to shower off Joyce's blood. Feeling
like he wanted to die, Steven went back to the kitchen and found two
steak knives with which he slit his own wrists. He lay down on the bed
waiting to die, but when he realized that he would not die from his
self-inflicted wounds, he got up and called the police, telling the
dispatcher that he had just murdered his wife.

When the police arrived they found Steven wandering around outside his
apartment building. Steven was despondent and tearful and seemed
detached, according to police officers who had been at the scene. He was
unconcerned about his own wounds, talking only about how much he loved
his wife and how he could not believe what he had done. Joyce Girouard
was pronounced dead at the scene.

At trial, defense witness, psychologist, Dr. William Stejskal, testified
that Steven was out of touch with his own capacity to experience anger
or express hostility. He stated that the events of October 28, 1987,
were entirely consistent with Steven's personality, that Steven had
"basically reach\[ed\] the limit of his ability to swallow his anger, to
rationalize his wife's behavior, to tolerate, or actually to remain in a
passive mode with that. He essentially went over the limit of his
ability to bottle up those strong emotions. What ensued was a very
extreme explosion of rage that was intermingled with a great deal of
panic." Another defense witness, psychiatrist, Thomas Goldman, testified
that Joyce had a "compulsive need to provoke jealousy so that she's
always asking for love and at the same time destroying and undermining
any chance that she really might have to establish any kind of mature
love with anybody."

Steven Girouard was convicted, at a court trial in the Circuit Court for
Montgomery County, of second degree murder and was sentenced to 22 years
incarceration, 10 of which were suspended. Upon his release, Petitioner
is to be on probation for five years, two years supervised and three
years unsupervised. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment
of the circuit court in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari to
determine whether the circumstances of the case presented provocation
adequate to mitigate the second degree murder charge to manslaughter.

Petitioner relies primarily on out of state cases to provide support for
his argument that the provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter
should not be limited only to the traditional circumstances of: extreme
assault or battery upon the defendant; mutual combat; defendant's
illegal arrest; injury or serious abuse of a close relative of the
defendant's; or the sudden discovery of a spouse's adultery. Petitioner
argues that manslaughter is a catchall for homicides which are criminal
but that lack the malice essential for a conviction of murder. Steven
argues that the trial judge did find provocation (although he held it
inadequate to mitigate murder) and that the categories of provocation
adequate to mitigate should be broadened to include factual situations
such as this one.

The State counters by stating that although there is no finite list of
legally adequate provocations, the common law has developed to a point
at which it may be said there are some concededly provocative acts that
society is not prepared to recognize as reasonable. Words spoken by the
victim, no matter how abusive or taunting, fall into a category society
should not accept as adequate provocation. According to the State, if
abusive words alone could mitigate murder to manslaughter, nearly every
domestic *argument* ending in the death of one party could be mitigated
to manslaughter. This, the State avers, is not an acceptable outcome.
Thus, the State argues that the courts below were correct in holding
that the taunting words by Joyce Girouard were not provocation adequate
to reduce Steven's second degree murder charge to voluntary
manslaughter.

Initially, we note that the difference between murder and manslaughter
is the presence or absence of malice. **\[ ... \]**Voluntary
manslaughter has been defined as "an *intentional* homicide, done in a
sudden heat of passion, caused by adequate provocation, before there has
been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool" (Emphasis in
original). *Cox v. State,* 311 Md. 326, 331**\[ ... \]**.

There are certain facts that may mitigate what would normally be murder
to manslaughter. For example, we have recognized as falling into that
group: (1) discovering one's spouse in the act of sexual intercourse
with another; (2) mutual combat; (3) assault and battery.**\[ ... \]**
There is also authority recognizing injury to one of the defendant's
relatives or to a third party, and death resulting from resistance of an
illegal arrest as adequate provocation for mitigation to
manslaughter.**\[ ... \]** Those acts mitigate homicide to manslaughter
because they create passion in the defendant and are not considered the
product of free will.**\[ ... \]**

In order to determine whether murder should be mitigated to manslaughter
we look to the circumstances surrounding the homicide and try to
discover if it was provoked by the victim. Over the facts of the case we
lay the template of the so-called "Rule of Provocation." The courts of
this State have repeatedly set forth the requirements of the Rule of
Provocation:

> 1\. There must have been adequate provocation;
>
> 2\. The killing must have been in the heat of passion;
>
> 3\. It must have been a sudden heat of passion --- that is, the
> killing must have followed the provocation before there had been a
> reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool;
>
> 4\. There must have been a causal connection between the provocation,
> the passion, and the fatal act.

*Sims v. State,* 319 Md. 540, 551**\[ ... \]** (1990)**\[ ... \]**.

We shall assume without deciding that the second, third, and fourth of
the criteria listed above were met in this case. We focus our attention
on an examination of the ultimate issue in this case, that is, whether
the provocation of Steven by Joyce was enough in the eyes of the law so
that the murder charge against Steven should have been mitigated to
voluntary manslaughter. For provocation to be "adequate," it must be "
'calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause
him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason.' " *Carter v.
State,* 66 Md.App. at 572**\[ ... \]**quoting R. Perkins, *Perkins on
Criminal Law* at p. 56 (2d ed. 1969). The issue we must resolve, then,
is whether the taunting words uttered by Joyce were enough to inflame
the passion of a *reasonable* man so that that man would be sufficiently
infuriated so as to strike out in hot-blooded blind passion to kill her.
Although we agree with the trial judge that there was needless
provocation by Joyce, we also agree with him that the provocation was
not adequate to mitigate second degree murder to voluntary manslaughter.

Although there are few Maryland cases discussing the issue at bar, those
that do hold that words alone are not adequate provocation. **\[ ...
\]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

words can constitute adequate provocation if they are accompanied by
conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the
defendant bodily harm. *Id.* Clearly, no such conduct was exhibited by
Joyce in this case. While Joyce did step on Steven's back and pull his
hair, he could not reasonably have feared bodily harm at her hands.
This, to us, is certain based on Steven's testimony at trial that Joyce
was about 5\'1\" tall and weighed 115 pounds, while he was 6\'2\" tall,
weighing over 200 pounds. Joyce simply did not have the size or strength
to cause Steven to fear for his bodily safety. Thus, since there was no
ability on the part of Joyce to cause Steven harm, the words she hurled
at him could not, under the analysis in *Lang,* constitute legally
sufficient provocation.

**\[ ... \]**

Thus, with no reservation, we hold that the provocation in this case was
not enough to cause a reasonable man to stab his provoker 19 times. **\[
... \]\[ ... \]**The standard is one of reasonableness; it does not and
should not focus on the peculiar frailties of mind of the Petitioner.
That standard of reasonableness has not been met here. We cannot in good
conscience countenance holding that a verbal domestic argument ending in
the death of one spouse can result in a conviction of manslaughter. We
agree with the trial judge that social necessity dictates our holding.
Domestic arguments easily escalate into furious fights. We perceive no
reason for a holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a
domestic dispute is by killing the offending spouse.

Notes & Questions (Maher & Girouard)

 

**Notes and Questions**

1\.    *Biases of the Reasonable Man.* In California, the standard for
adequate provocation \"is whether or not the defendant\'s reason was, at
the time of his act, so disturbed or obscured by some passion \[...\] to
such an extent as would render ordinary men of average disposition
liable to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, and
from this passion rather than from judgment." [*People v. Beltran, 56
Cal. 4th 935, 948 (2013), (citing People v. Logan,  175 Cal. 45, 49
(1917))*](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I5601adffcc6511e2a98ec867961a22de/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad740160000017a60b33256563bdea7%3Fppcid%3D85081a06fc124025801288c9b905652c%26Nav%3DCASE%26fragmentIdentifier%3DI5601adffcc6511e2a98ec867961a22de%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=4c4602285d4088f1b075eb364507ef91&list=CASE&rank=1&sessionScopeId=4e69a450867427e6b9277dcfbe0490f8d6dd5a27f39cee392d076304985bca69&ppcid=85081a06fc124025801288c9b905652c&originationContext=Smart%20Answer&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29).
Do you see any inherent bias in the way such a standard is worded? Would
an \"ordinary man\" react differently in a provocative situation than an
\"ordinary woman\"? At common law, witnessing one\'s spouse in the act
of adultery was grounds to mitigate murder to manslaughter. Consider
that adultery was once viewed as the "\'highest invasion of \[a
husband's\] property," and that  "a 'reasonable man' might be provoked
to kill his adulterous wife, but not his adulterous fiancée or
common-law wife." Brief for San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium
et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting the People of the State of California,
People v. Beltran, 56 Cal. 4th 935 (2013) (No. S192644.), 2012 WL
1859371 at 7-8. Can courts now use this justification to mitigate a
husband's killing of his adulterous wife from murder to manslaughter?
Could the same justification be used to defend a wife who killed her
adulterous husband?  

2\.    *Are Words Ever Enough?* Do you believe that there is ever a
circumstance in which words could constitute adequate provocation?
Suppose that *P* is a person of color who hears a rumor that X, Y, and Z
murdered somebody in a hate crime. He is walking home alone when all of
a sudde, he is surrounded by several people wearing Swastikas. He
recognizes X, Y, and Z in the group. They yell racial slurs at him and
promise to hurt him and his family. If *P* kills one of them and asserts
a provocation defense, will he succeed under *Girouard?* Would it make a
difference if he had personally witnessed the prior hate-crime murder?
In *Girouard,* the court ruled that "words alone are not adequate
provocation," reasoning that Joyce's words were not "accompanied by
conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the
defendant bodily harm." But what if the words constitute real threats?
Is there a substantive difference between the weight of the words used
by X, Y, and Z (racial slurs and threats) and words agreeing to commit a
criminal conspiracy? For more on the intersection between race and
criminal law, see [*Cynthia Lee's Article: Race and the Criminal Law
Curriculum*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3572334).

3\.    *Further Thinking.* "Under the common law, the doctrine of
provocation developed along the lines of fixed categories of conduct by
the victim, paradigms of misbehavior, which the law recognized as
sufficiently provocative to mitigate what would otherwise be malicious
conduct by the defendant.\" [*Brown v. United States, 584 A.2d 537 (D.C.
App.
1990)*](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ic69036d834e711d98b61a35269fc5f88/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad740160000017a60babc7f563bdfb4%3Fppcid%3Db1011956855a46a3babaffc8f15aabb9%26Nav%3DCASE%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIc69036d834e711d98b61a35269fc5f88%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=4a16f72eaee21ee571d0d934970a38c7&list=CASE&rank=4&sessionScopeId=4e69a450867427e6b9277dcfbe0490f8d6dd5a27f39cee392d076304985bca69&ppcid=b1011956855a46a3babaffc8f15aabb9&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29).
As cited in *Girouard*, examples of the categorical acts that constitute
adequate provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter include
\"discovering one's spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with
another; mutual combat; assault and battery \[...\] injury to one of the
defendant's relatives or to a third party, and death resulting from
resistance of an illegal arrest.\"  

However, the modern trend in many states, *is like even the older case
of Maher, in not limiting provocation to a narrow group of fixed
categories.*

What problems do you see with the common law provocation doctrine
limiting provocation to explicitly stated behaviors? What does the
common law assume about an objective, "reasonable man"? Are the flaws in
these assumptions remedied by inviting the jury to decide what an
"ordinary person of average disposition" is? Is the absence of objective
evidence to support such inferences a fatal flaw, or is it actually
consistent with the jury\'s role throughout the US criminal legal
system? 

4\.    *How Much Evidence.* Typically, it is left to the jury to decide
what constitutes a \"reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool.\"
How should we determine what is a \"reasonable opportunity for the
passion to cool?\" Does this standard necessarily bar evidence of
provocative conduct that occurred long before the killing?

Imagine that student A is deathly allergic to peanuts. Even their scent
causes A to suffer anaphylaxis, which of course induces great fear in A.
B, knowing of A\'s situation, purposefully brings a bag of peanuts to
class and opens them next to A. A goes into anaphylactic shock and is
hospitalized overnight. The next day, A returns to class and kills B.
What result under *Girouard*? What result under [*Maher v. People, 10
Mich. 212
(1862)*](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ie6dddd0802ca11dab386b232635db992/View/FullText.html?originationContext=typeAhead&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default))
**\[ ... \]**

Now imagine that for years, *M* has been bullied by *T*. One day, *M*
finally snaps in direct response to one of *T\'*s abusive episodes and
kills *T.* Should evidence illustrating *M* and *T\'*s earlier
interactions be taken into consideration when deciding whether *M* has a
provocation defense or should the jury only consider the event
immediately preceding *M*\'s killing of *T*? What result under
*Girouard*? What result under *Maher*? **\[ ... \]**

5\.    *Excuse and Justification.* Are these examples excuses\--things
that we do not punish as harshly because "most people act that way"\--or
justifications\--circumstances that justify the act*(e.g.
self-defense)?* What about the common law provocation doctrine involving
a wife's infidelity? (See Note 1, above) How might this be complicated
by gender (see note 8, below)?

6\.    *Another Hypothetical.* Suppose a woman, *D,* hears that her son
has been hit by a blue SUV and is severely injured. A witness with
faulty memory recites the license plate. After several hours, D
identifies what she believes is the car involved in the accident and
confronts the driver of the car, *V*. In reality, *V* had nothing to do
with the accident. However, blinded by her rage, *D* ends up killing
*V.* What result under *Girouard?* Under the MPC? 

**\[ ... \]**

*7.    Traditional Common Law Approach.* Common law held that a
"reasonable man" must be judged by a wholly objective test, completely
eliminating a defendant\'s physical condition and characteristics. If,
as in Girouard, the words-alone rule were abandoned, would you change
the common law's view on a "reasonable man"? What if the defendant was
only 4 feet 5 inches tall, and the victim 6 feet\--should the court be
permitted to consider the defendant's physical stature in deciding
whether there was adequate provocation? What language indicates that
physical characteristics/size differences came into play in *Girouard*?
What result if Joyce had advanced combat training and Steven had not? 

*8     Gender and the Reasonable Man*. Consider the common law's
"reasonable man" standard as you read through these statistics.

-           "Of the \[homicide\] offenders for whom gender was known,
    90.3 percent were males." [*U.S. Department of Justice Federal
    Bureau of Investiagtion, Uniform Crime Report: Crime in the United
    States
    (2010)*](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expandhomicidemain)

-           "Females are generally murdered by people they know. In 64%
    of female homicide cases in 2007, females were killed by a family
    member or intimate partner." [*Bureau of Justice Statistics, Victims
    of Violence (2009)*](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvv.pdf)

-           Over half of female homicides are products of intimate
    partner violence. [*Center of Disease
    Control*](http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6628a1). Petrosky E., et
    al. Racial and Ethnic Differences in Homicides of Adult Women and
    the Role of Intimate Partner Violence, MMWR Morb mortal Wkly Rep
    2017; 66: 741-746 (2003-2014)

Often, adequate provocation reflects a traditional male view of self
control, mostly because homicide statistics are largely male dominated.
Should jurors consider gender when deciding whether the accused falls
under a "reasonable man" standard? How should jurors judge the accused
if she identifies as a woman and claims she was adequately provoked - by
the reasonable man standard, or something else? 

If men are statistically more likely to be violent, does that mean that
the law should regard women who kill as less reasonable when they
respond with violence to provocation?  What is the ongoing utility for
the provocation defense, in the face of gender and other disparities?
(i.e. does it help safeguard values such as fairness or
blameworthiness?).    

Finally, it may be that norms about traditional masculinity themselves
actually contribute to violence. [\"Masculine ideals, such as the
restriction of emotional expression and the pressure to conform to
expectations of dominance and aggression, may heighten the potential for
boys to engage in general acts of violence including, but not limited
to, bullying, assault, and/or physical and verbal
aggression.\"](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/newsletter/2018/09/harmful-masculinity)
If true, this means that a solution may lie in recognizing
\"gender-related social norms and seek\[ing\] to change the way men view
and express themselves\....\"

*9*.    *Extreme Emotional Disturbance.* The
[*MPC*](https://www.inazu-crimlaw.com/2103) states that a criminal
homicide constitutes manslaughter when "a homicide which would otherwise
be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or
emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or
excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be
determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under
the circumstances as he believes them to be."  States such as Oregon
*and New York also*use language of "extreme emotional disturbance" in
their manslaughter statutes. When reading the next case, consider
whether the MPC approach solves any problems you may have identified
with adequate provocation, and/or whether it introduces any new
problems.

Comment to MPC Section 210.3

 

### Comment to Section 210.3

This formulation effects substantial changes in the traditional notion
of provocation. For one thing, it does not require that the actor's
emotional distress arise from some injury, affront, or other provocative
act perpetrated upon him by the deceased. Under the Code, mitigation may
be appropriate where the actor believes that the deceased is responsible
for some injustice to another or even where he strikes out in a blinding
rage and kills an innocent bystander.

Section 210.3 also sweeps away the rigid rules that limited provocation
to certain defined circumstances. Instead it casts the issue in phrases
that have no common-law antecedents and hence no accumulated doctrinal
content... This development reflects the trend of many modern decisions
to abandon preconceived notions of what constitutes adequate provocation
and to submit that question to the jury's deliberation.

The critical element in the Model Code formulation is the clause
requiring that reasonable be assessed "from the viewpoint of a person in
the actor's situation." The word "situation" is designedly ambiguous. On
the one hand, it is clear that personal handicaps and some external
circumstances must be taken into account. Thus, blindness, shock from
traumatic injury, and extreme grief are all easily read into the term
"situation" This result is sound, for it would be morally obtuse to
appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment without reference to these
factors. On the other hand, it is equally plain that idiosyncratic moral
values are not part of the actor's situation. An assassin who kills a
political leader because he believes it is right to do so cannot ask
that he be judged by the standard of a reasonable extremist. Any other
result would undermine the normative message of the criminal law. In
between these two extremes, however, there are matters neither as
clearly distinct from individual blameworthiness as blindness or
handicap nor as integral a part of moral depravity as a belief in the
rightness of killing.

**STATE of Oregon, Respondent On Review,**

**v.**

**Calvin Roy OTT, Petitioner On Review.**

**\[ ... \]**

Decided July 10, 1984.

 

LENT, Justice.

The primary issue is how a jury is to be instructed on \"extreme
emotional disturbance\" for the purpose of determining whether a
criminal homicide is murder or manslaughter. The defendant was charged
with murder for killing his wife in April, 1980. It is undisputed that
the defendant killed her intentionally; the dispute is whether he was
under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. If he was, he
would be guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. . .

 

**The Evidence**

A description of the evidence and the facts which could be found
therefrom as perceived by the defendant is relevant to the question of
whether he could have been found by the jury to be under the influence
of extreme emotional disturbance when he committed the criminal
homicide, thereby necessitating an instruction on extreme emotional
disturbance. There was evidence of the following:

The defendant exhibited instability after his discharge from the Air
Force in 1972. He \"drifted in various parts of the United States\" and
put \"very little order to his life.\" In 1975 he returned to his
mother\'s home in Grants Pass and stayed there intermittently.

At some point after his return to Grants Pass, he began to cohabit with
a woman who had three children. This lasted for a little over a year.
The woman then asked the defendant to move out because of his drinking
and unannounced disappearances. She was three months\' pregnant by him
at the time.

The defendant then enrolled at Rogue Community College at Grants Pass.
There he met the now deceased Stephanie Elaine Brinkley, whom he married
three weeks after their initial meeting. Some months after their
marriage, they had a fight over \"money matters\" and separated. \...

Defendant attempted to return to his wife; however, she had begun seeing
someone else. Defendant attempted to fight Stephanie\'s new lover.
Stephanie intervened, sent her new lover away and promised that her
conduct would not be repeated.

There were other separations, and the defendant, upon his return from
each separation and his learning of more infidelities, became
progressively more upset. This was especially so after the birth of
their first child. ...

He had been warned by the \"authorities\" to stay away from Stephanie.
She apparently caused him to be placed under a judicial restraining
order; however, despite her obtaining the order, Stephanie telephoned
him regarding their divorce. They engaged in an apparently protracted
series of arguments on the telephone over child custody, which
eventuated in the defendant\'s arrest and jailing for harassment. Even
though they engaged in arguments and fights, they continued to
associate. Defendant could not stay away from Stephanie and Stephanie
did not always discourage his attentions.

In 1980 Stephanie began to live with another man. This conduct affected
the defendant, as before, with tension and \"stress.\" The defendant\'s
reaction was even more intense than before, and he threatened to kill
Stephanie on several occasions.

In early April, 1980, Stephanie\'s son, Jonathan (defendant\'s stepson),
broke his arm and was in the hospital. The defendant and Stephanie met
each other at the hospital in order to visit with the child on three
occasions. It was arranged that on the third occasion the defendant was
to drive Stephanie home after hospital visiting hours were over.
Defendant had the impression from their first two meetings at the
hospital that the relationship was improving. He was thus angered and
disappointed when his wife\'s new lover appeared at the hospital on
their third meeting to take her home. Defendant left the hospital in a
state of agitation. He retrieved a .22 rifle that he had stored at the
home of a friend, caught up with his wife and her lover, ran their truck
off the road and shot his wife three times. \...

**History of Mitigating Factor**

Before addressing how a jury should be charged in a case where the
influence of extreme emotional disturbance may reduce an intentional
criminal homicide from murder to manslaughter, we pause to examine the
history of the mitigating factor.

The defense of extreme emotional disturbance is a modification of the
defense of provocation or heat of passion. The provocation defense is
very old. The distinction between a slaying in cold blood and one in the
heat of passion existed in Anglo-Saxon criminal law and survived the
Norman conquest of 1066. The \"Doctrine of Provocation\" became firmly
established in the law in 1628 when Coke adopted the distinction between
homicide committed after deliberation and homicide committed in the
course of a sudden quarrel... Then, as now, manslaughter ... depended on
the presence of heat of passion caused by adequate provocation. ...

In the mid-nineteenth century, the judgment as to whether a provocation
was adequate for the heat of passion defense was made by the judge as a
determination of law; however, judges gradually began to leave
borderline cases to the jury. The reasonable man standard of review for
provocation was devised as a manner of instructing the jury on marginal
cases. It was also a device for enabling the jury to serve as community
conscience or standard of measure for reasonable behavior. ...

This has been said to be an objective test, meaning that neither the
mental nor physical peculiarities of the accused are evaluated in
determining whether his loss of self-control was reasonable. ...

The common law heat of passion or provocation defense placed the jury in
the conceptually awkward (to put it kindly) position of having to
determine when it is reasonable for a reasonable man to act
unreasonably. . .

**The Model Penal Code \[adopted by Oregon in 1970\]**

The drafters of the Model Penal Code were aware of the anomaly and
pointed out that harsh and unjust results were obtained from applying
the objective test for provocation. They cited State v. Gounagias, 88
Wash. 304, 153 P. 9 (1915), as a model of an unjust result achieved
through application of the objective test for provocation. ...

\[That case involved a defendant who, humiliated after being raped by a
man in his community, asked him not to tell others about the incident.
The assailant persisted in spreading the story, which resulted in
defendant's being shamed and isolated from his community. After an angry
confrontation with the assailant, defendant went home, got a gun and
returned to kill the assailant. The court denied defendant's request for
mitigation from murder to manslaughter, finding Gounagias has waited too
long after the original incident for provocation to be invoked.\]

The drafters of the Model Penal Code found it \"shocking\" to disregard
that the passage of time served only to increase rather than diminish
Gounagias\' outrage as the story became known. Model Penal Code
Tentative draft No. 9 § 201.3 at 48. They said:

\"...in such a situation as Gounagias, where lapse of time increased
rather than diminished the extent of the outrage perpetrated on the
actor, as he became aware that his disgrace was known, it was shocking
in our view to hold this vital fact to be irrelevant. ...\"

 

**The Trial Court\'s Instruction**

\[At the close of the trial, the court instructed the jury. . .: You are
instructed that there are varying degrees of emotional disturbance. Not
every disturbance is an extreme emotional disturbance in the law. *In
determining what the term extreme means with reference to extreme
emotional disturbance I instruct you that the term means the outermost
or furthest, most remote in any direction, final or last, and four,
there must be a reasonable explanation to the extreme emotional
disturbance and its resulting homicidal act*." \[italics added\]

Both in the trial court and on appeal the defendant has argued that the
term \"extreme emotional disturbance\" is made up of words of ordinary
meaning, not given any special definition by the legislature and,
therefore, there is no reason or need for a trial court to enlarge upon
them for the benefit of the jury. ...

We agree with the defendant that the jury should be instructed on the
meaning of the whole term rather than singling out the word \"extreme\"
for amplification. The point of the extreme emotional disturbance
defense is to provide a basis for mitigation that differs from a finding
of mental defect or disease to such an extent as altogether to preclude
criminal responsibility.

... The notion of \"extreme\" provided for the jury ... is consonant
with an understanding of emotional disturbance that might preclude
criminal responsibility. The words \"outermost or furthest, most remote
in any direction, final or last,\" as used by the court to define
\"extreme,\" would seem to require a state of mind so far from the norm
as to be characteristic of a mental illness. The defense was meant to be
understood in more relative terms as referring to a loss of self-control
due to intense feelings.

...

We have still to determine how a jury is to determine whether there was
a reasonable explanation for the emotional disturbance. This is a
sensitive task because the Oregon statute \[like the MPC\] requires that
the \"reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance shall be
determined from the standpoint of an ordinary person,\" ORS 163.135(1).
On the other hand, the statute requires that the reasonableness of the
interpretation must be judged from the standpoint of \"the actor\'s
situation under the circumstances as the actor reasonably believes them
to be.\" The juxtaposition of these two requirements for determining the
adequacy of the explanation prevents the adequacy from being determined
on either wholly objective or subjective grounds. The words \"ordinary
person\" and \"reasonableness of the explanation\" recall the reasonable
man standard of the heat of passion defense, which is an objective test,
while the requirement of taking into account the actor\'s situation
suggests a more subjective analysis...

Donovan and Wildman in their article, *Is the Reasonable Man Obsolete? A
Critical Perspective on Self-Defense and Provocation,* hypothesize the
following example:

> An Asian-American man, Harold Sato, who had been interned in a
> detention camp for Japanese during World War II, faces repeated racial
> prejudice at his job. One day after repeated racial slurs from a
> co-worker he kills the co-worker. 14 Loyola L.Rev. 435, 438 (1981). 

The authors observe:

> The anomaly of a purely objective standard of provocation is
> underlined by Mr. Sato\'s case. \* \* \* A reasonable man, viewed in
> the abstract, is not likely to be roused to the heat of passion by a
> verbal insult. However, an Asian-American who had been interned in a
> concentration camp is likely to be roused to the heat of passion by
> racial slurs. To the extent that a jury is not allowed to consider Mr.
> Sato\'s racial background and previous experience of racial
> discrimination in determining his moral culpability, Mr. Sato is more
> likely to be convicted of murder \* \* \* than of voluntary
> manslaughter. Id at 449.

By requiring the factfinder to focus on a person in the defendant\'s
\"situation,\" the drafters of the Model Penal Code sought to work
change. One writer, relying upon the Model Penal Code commentary, has
put it:

\[I\]t makes the test more, although not entirely, subjective, by
requiring the jury to test the reasonableness of the actor\'s conduct,
'from the viewpoint of a person in the actor\'s situation.' Thus, the
actor\'s sex, sexual preference, pregnancy, physical deformities, and
similar characteristics are apt to be taken into consideration in
evaluating the reasonableness of the defendant\'s behavior. (Footnotes
omitted.) Dressler, Rethinking Heat of Passion: A Defense in Search of a
Rationale, 73 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 421, 431 (1982).

...

**Conclusion**

Given the hybrid approach adopted by the legislature to the weight to be
accorded to subjective and objective factors in the calculus involved in
this kind of case, we do not believe that any court can state a
suggested jury instruction that is completely impervious to criticism of
its logic. We must leave the trial courts and juries where the statute
places them. Making the best of this situation, we conclude that a trial
court\'s charge must be constructed for any particular case along the
following general lines. . .

Third, the jury should be asked to consider whether the homicide was
committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. It was
if the defendant was under the influence of an emotional disturbance to
the extent that he lost the capacity to control himself and forego the
homicide. The jury should be instructed that if it finds that the
homicide was not committed under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance, the jury need not further consider the issue of mitigation
of murder to manslaughter. If the jury finds that the homicide was
committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, it must
then consider . . . the reasonableness of the explanation for the
disturbance.

\[Next\], the jury must determine what was the defendant\'s situation in

Notes & Questions (EED & State v. Ott)

 

**Notes and Questions**

1\.    *Elements of Extreme Emotional Distress*. **\[ ... \]**

Per Model Penal Code Section 210.3:

\(1\) Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when: 

\(b\) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the
influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is
reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation
or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the
actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.

**\[ ... \]**

2\.    *Another Hypothetical.* A man from Kentucky by the name of Bob is
the father of a seventeen year-old daughter, Annamae. He has never shown
any propensity towards violence, nor does he generally look at acts of
violence favorably. Bob holds a belief, however, that Californians are
infected with a certain parasite that can kill Kentuckians with whom
they are in physical contact. Bob sees Annamae talking with Chad, her
friend from California. Bob also sees her touching his hand. Bob becomes
fearful for Annamae's life and tells Chad to let go of her hand. Chad
lets go, looks at Bob in bewilderment, and says, "Dude, you gotta chill,
what is going on?" This only makes Bob more furious because of Chad's
apparent lack of concern for Annamae's safety, at which point Bob pulls
out his revolver and shoots and kills Chad. In view of *Ott*, how should
this case be analyzed? 

3\.    *Passion's Progress.* Can a more subjective analysis mitigate
homicides? Many intimate partner homicides occur after "departure
claims," where the decedent announces in deeds, such as moving furniture
out, or words, such as filing for divorce or stating future plans, that
he/she is leaving the relationship. Professor Victoria Nourse, who
compared cases that apply the MPC's "extreme mental or emotional
disturbance" standard to cases that use common law standards, found that
26% of MPC claims that reached juries involved "departure" claims,
whereas none of these claims reached juries in jurisdictions using the
common law approach. [*Victoria Nourse, Passion's Progress: Modern Law
Reform and the Provocation Defense, 106 Yale L.J. 1331, 1353
(1997)*](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2013&context=facpub).
Essentially, when cases were able to reach juries, there was a question
of fact that needed answering, which allowed for more evidence to be
submitted. In many cases, the victim was killed when he/she moved
furniture out, announced his/her departure, or filed for divorce.
Professor Nourse further discovered that when a defendant in a criminal
homicide case alleged infidelity after the relationship had ended, the
case would reach the jury 88% of the time in MPC states versus 39% of
the time in common law jurisdictions. Id. at 1362. With these results in
mind, Professor Nourse concluded that the MPC produced "illiberal and
often perverse" results. Id. at 1332. 

Based on these facts, should we specify statutory language to cover
these sets of facts? What would an abolitionist approach to this problem
look like? Could we avoid the harm entirely with more adequate support
systems or affordable housing?  

For more on the nexus between housing insecurity and domestic violence,
see [*John Pavao, Jennifer Alvarez, Nikki Baumrind, Marta Induni, and
Rachel Kimerling's Study: Intimate Partner Violence and Housing
Instability. *](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074937970600434X?casa_token=WomD5Dd3e18AAAAA:GnhLlro7LxlX2ndqe0aDR1NX9SYDzKGINquv70bMebS-L80KSLxwONbsFyp0xKcp8lS_PWQTzQ)

4\.    *Objective and Subjective.* Recall the Oregon statute. What
language in the Oregon statute suggests an objective standard of extreme
emotional disturbance? What language suggests a subjective standard? If
you were a prosecutor, which standard (objective or subjective) would
you want to take precedence over the other? How would you make this
argument? 

What about if you were practicing as a defense attorney? Is there a
benefit to this hybrid approach? Is it confusing or flexible?

5\.    *Gender and the Law.* Voluntary manslaughter has been said to
"ha\[ve\] never been a female-friendly doctrine." Emily L. Miller,
(Wo)manslaughter: Voluntary Manslaughter, Gender, and the Model Penal
Code, 50 Emory L.J. 665, 667 (2001). Some scholars have even called for
the abolition of the heat-of-passion factor, and the argument is
summarized as follows:

Provocation is a male-centered and male-dominated defense. Although the
defense is supposedly founded on compassion for ordinary human
infirmity, it is really a legal disguise to partially excuse male
aggression by treating men "as natural aggressors, and in particular
women\'s natural aggressors." Men who are provoked desire to inflict
retaliatory suffering on those who have attacked their self-worth. More
often than not, the self-worth "attackers\'\' are women. In studies of
battered women, for example, violence is prompted by male possessiveness
and sexual jealousy; a male\'s feelings of self-worth require "absolute
possession of a woman\'s sexual fidelity, of her labour, and of (on
demand) her presence, love, and attention in general." In reality,
therefore, the defense simply reinforces precisely what the law should
seek to eradicate, namely, "men\'s violence against women, and their
violence in general." [*Joshua Dressler, Why Keep the Provocation
Defense?: Some Reflections on A Difficult Subject, 86 Minn. L. Rev. 959,
975-976
(2002). *](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292007427_Why_keep_the_provocation_defense_Some_reflections_on_a_difficult_subject)

*he only major traditional category of adequate provocation that does
not involve an actual or threatened physical assault, adultery is often
referred to as "the paradigm example of provocation adequate to mitigate
murder to voluntary manslaughter." Applying social science data and
feminist theory regarding domestic violence, Donna K. Coker reexamines
the connection between heat of passion and adultery law in her
article, [Donna K. Coker, Heat of Passion and Wife Killing: Men Who
Batter/Men Who Kill, 2 S. Cal. Rev. L. & Women's Stud. 71
(1992).](https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1622&=&context=fac_articles&=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252Furl%253Fq%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Frepository.law.miami.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%25253D1622%252526context%25253Dfac_articles%2526sa%253DD%2526source%253Deditors%2526ust%253D1625196547380000%2526usg%253DAOvVaw2MKdo7f6Wl00MD5yRz81ED#search=%22https%3A%2F%2Frepository.law.miami.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1622%26context%3Dfac_articles%22)
For a disturbing, compelling analysis of the ways in which courts have
used the modernized \"extreme emotional disturbance\" standard to reduce
murder to manslaughter in cases involving women killed by their partners
after attempting to exit the relationship, see [Victoria Nourse,
Passion's Progress: Modern Law Reform and the Provocation Defense, 106
Yale L.J. 1331-1448
(1997)](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2013&=&context=facpub&=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252Furl%253Fq%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fscholarship.law.georgetown.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%25253D2013%252526context%25253Dfacpub%2526sa%253DD%2526source%253Deditors%2526ust%253D1625196690019000%2526usg%253DAOvVaw2Kgr8cAv3h0PxveQ5nFlJZ#search=%22https%3A%2F%2Fscholarship.law.georgetown.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D2013%26context%3Dfacpub%22).*

Professor Nourse is in favor of keeping the provocation defense[^96],
but making it available in fewer circumstances, because "the defendant's
claim to our compassion must put him in a position of normative equality
vis-a-vis his victim." She further comments that this only exists when
society "shares" the defendant's rage, such that the provoker's conduct
would result in criminal punishment. [*Victoria Nourse, Passion's
Progress: Modern Law Reform and the Provocation Defense, 106 Yale L.J.
1331, 1396
(1997)*](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2013&context=facpub).
Because adultery is no longer a crime in almost all jurisdictions, this
would lead to a revocation of a provocation defense when a defendant
kills in the heat of passion that stems from the victim's infidelity.
Thus, without any other defenses or mitigating factors available, the
defendant would be guilty of murder.

Regarding viewpoints on keeping versus abolishing the defense, which of
these do you find more persuasive? Would it be better to abolish
provocation as a defense? Or do you think it would be better to retain
the defense, and if so, do you prefer the common law heat-of-passion
doctrine or the MPC's "extreme mental or emotional disturbance"
provision? 

6\.      *Abolition. *If we were to abolish provocation as a mitigating
factor, how might we replace it? Should it be replaced, or should it be
removed entirely? The United Kingdom replaced provocation as a
mitigating factor with the statutory partial defense called "loss of
control" as codified in the Coroners and Justice Act (2009):

1.  Where a person ("D") kills or is a party to the killing of another
    ("V"), D is not to be convicted of murder if-

-   a\. D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing
    resulted from D's loss of self-control, 

    b\. the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and 

    c\. a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance
    and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D, might have reacted
    in the same or in a similar way to D. 

2.  For the purpose of subsection (1)(a), it does not matter whether or
    not the loss of control was sudden.

3.  In subsection (1)(c), the reference to "the circumstances of D" is a
    reference to all of D's circumstances other than those whose only
    relevance to D's conduct is that they bear on D's general capacity
    for tolerance or self-restraint.

Under this Act, a "qualifying trigger" for D's loss of self-control is
one attributable to:

1.  D's fear of serious violence from V against D or "another identified
    person"; or

2.  a thing or things done or said (or both) which-

-   a\. constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and 

    b\. caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged;
    or

3.  a combination of the matters mentioned \[above\].

**\[ ... \]**

Lummus, J.

On November 28, 1942, and for about nine years before that day, a
corporation named New Cocoanut Grove, Inc., maintained and operated a
"night club" in Boston, **\[ ... \]**The corporation, its officers and
employees, and its business, were completely dominated by the defendant
Barnett Welansky, who is called in this opinion simply the defendant,
since his codefendants were acquitted by the jury. **\[ ... \]** He was
entitled to, and took, all the profits. Internally, the corporation was
operated without regard to corporate forms, as though the business were
that of the defendant as an individual.**\[ ... \]**

The defendant was accustomed to spend his evenings at the night club,
inspecting the premises and superintending the business. On November 16,
1942, he became suddenly ill, and was carried to. a hospital, where he
was in bed for three weeks and remained until discharged on December 11,
1942. During his stay at the hospital, although employees visited him
there, he did not concern himself with the night club, because, as he
testified, he "knew it would be all right" and that "the same system . .
. \[he\] had would continue" during his absence. There is no evidence of
any act, omission or condition at the night club on November 28, 1942,
(apart from the lighting of a match hereinafter described), that was not
within the usual and regular practice during the time before the
defendant was taken ill when he was at the night club nearly every
evening. **\[ ... \]**

We now come to the story of the fire. A little after ten o'clock on the
evening of Saturday, November 28, 1942, the night club was well filled
with a crowd of patrons. It was during the busiest season of the year.
An important football game in the afternoon had attracted many visitors
to Boston. Witnesses were rightly permitted to testify that the dance
floor had from eighty to one hundred persons on it, and that it was
\"very crowded." **\[ ... \]**Upon the evidence it could have been found
that at that time there were from two hundred fifty to four hundred
persons in the Melody Lounge, from four hundred to five hundred in the
main dining room and the Caricature Bar, and two hundred fifty in the
Cocktail Lounge. Yet it could have been found that the crowd was no
larger than it had been on other Saturday evenings before the defendant
was taken ill, and that there had been larger crowds at earlier times.
**\[ ... \]**

A bartender in the Melody Lounge noticed that an electric light bulb
which was in or near the cocoanut husks of an artificial palm tree in
the corner had been turned off and that the corner was dark. He directed
a sixteen year old bar boy who was waiting on customers at the tables to
cause the bulb to be lighted. A soldier sitting with other persons near
the light told the bar boy to leave it unlighted. But the bar boy got a
stool, lighted a match in order to see the bulb, turned the bulb in its
socket, and thus lighted it. The bar boy blew the match out, and started
to walk away. Apparently the flame of the match had ignited the palm
tree and that had speedily ignited the low cloth ceiling near it, for
both flamed up almost instantly. The fire spread with great rapidity
across the upper part of the room, causing much heat. The crowd in the
Melody Lounge rushed up the stairs, but the fire preceded them. People
got on fire while on the stairway. The fire spread with great speed
across the foyer and into the Caricature Bar and the main dining room,
and thence into the Cocktail Lounge. Soon after the fire started the
lights in the night club went out. The smoke had a peculiar odor. The
crowd were panic stricken, and rushed and pushed in every direction
through the night club, screaming, and overturning tables and chairs in
their attempts to escape.

The door at the head of the Melody Lounge stairway was not opened until
firemen broke it down from outside with an axe and found it locked by a
key lock, so that the panic bar could not operate. Two dead bodies were
found close to it, and a pile of bodies about seven feet from it. The
door in the vestibule of the office did not become open, and was barred
by the clothing rack. The revolving door soon jammed, but was burst out
by the pressure of the crowd. The head waiter and another waiter tried
to get open the panic doors from the main dining room to Shawmut street,
and succeeded after some difficulty. The other two doors to Shawmut
Street were locked, and were opened by force from outside by firemen and
others. Some patrons escaped through them, but many dead bodies were
piled up inside them. A considerable number of patrons escaped through
the Broadway door, but many died just inside that door. Some employees,
and a great number of patrons, died in the fire. Others were taken out
of the building with fatal burns and injuries from smoke, and died
within a few days.

I. *The pleadings, verdicts, and judgments.*

The **\[ ... \]**alleged misconduct of the defendant consisted in
causing or permitting or failing reasonably to prevent defective wiring,
the installation of inflammable decorations, the absence of fire doors,
the absence of "proper means of egress properly maintained" and
"sufficient proper" exits, and overcrowding. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The defendant was found guilty **\[ ... \]**He was sentenced to
imprisonment in the State prison**\[ ... \]**for a term of not less than
twelve years and not more than fifteen years, the first day of said term
to be in solitary confinement and the residue at hard labor **\[ ...
\]**

II\. *The principles governing liability.*

The Commonwealth disclaimed any contention that the defendant
intentionally killed or injured the persons named in the indictments as
victims. It based its case on *involuntary* manslaughter through wanton
or reckless conduct. The judge instructed the jury correctly with
respect to the nature of such conduct.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X2474617c7d369ffad0b6cc3dd7d281d1ec4ce75)

Usually wanton or reckless conduct consists of an affirmative act, like
driving an automobile or discharging a firearm, in disregard of probable
harmful consequences to another. But where, as in the present case,
there is a duty of care for the safety of business visitors invited to
premises which the defendant controls,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X4257320aa3287aec4a546bf9d20f476042acd91) wanton or reckless
conduct may consist of intentional failure to take such care in
disregard of the probable harmful consequences to them or of their right
to care. **\[ ... \]**

To define wanton or reckless conduct so as to distinguish it clearly
from negligence and gross negligence is not easy. **\[ ... \]**

The standard of wanton or reckless conduct is at once subjective and
objective, as has been recognized ever since *Commonwealth* v. *Pierce,*
138 Mass. 165. Knowing facts that would cause a reasonable man to know
the danger is equivalent to knowing the danger. **\[ ... \]**The judge
charged the jury correctly when he said, "To constitute wanton or
reckless conduct, as distinguished from mere negligence, grave danger to
others must have been apparent, and the defendant must have chosen to
run the risk rather than alter his conduct so as to avoid the act or
omission which caused the harm. If the grave danger was in fact realized
by the defendant, his subsequent voluntary act or omission which caused
the harm amounts to wanton or reckless conduct, no matter whether the
ordinary man would have realized the gravity of the danger or not. But
even if a particular defendant is so stupid \[or\] so heedless - . . .
that in fact he did not realize the grave danger, he cannot escape the
imputation of wanton or reckless conduct in his dangerous act or
omission, if an ordinary normal man under the same circumstances would
have realized the gravity of the danger. A man may be reckless within
the meaning of the law although he himself thought he was careful."

The essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way
either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which
conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will
result to another. **\[ ... \]** Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to
what has been variously described as indifference to or disregard of
probable\' consequences to that other **\[ ... \]**

The words "wanton" and "reckless" are thus not merely rhetorical or
vituperative expressions used instead of negligent or grossly negligent.
They express a difference in the degree of risk and in the voluntary
taking of risk so marked, as compared with negligence, as to amount
substantially and in the eyes of the law to a difference in kind. **\[
... \]**For many years this court has been careful to preserve the
distinction between negligence and gross negligence, on the one hand,
and wanton or reckless conduct on the other. **\[ ... \]**

conduct does not become criminal until it passes the borders of
negligence and gross negligence and enters into the domain of wanton or
reckless conduct. There is in Massachusetts at common law no such thing
as "criminal negligence." **\[ ... \]**

Wanton or reckless conduct is the legal equivalent of intentional
conduct. **\[ ... \]** If by wanton or reckless conduct bodily injury is
caused to another, the person guilty of such conduct is guilty of
assault and battery. **\[ ... \]**And since manslaughter is simply a
battery that causes death **\[ ... \]**if death results he is guilty of
manslaughter. **\[ ... \]**

To convict the defendant of manslaughter, the Commonwealth was not
required to prove that he caused the fire by some wanton or reckless
conduct. Fire in a place of public resort is an ever present danger. It
was enough to prove that death resulted from his wanton or reckless
disregard of the safety of patrons in the event of fire from any cause.

State v. Williams

**484 P.2d 1167**

**STATE of Washington, Respondent,**\
**v.**\
**Walter L. WILLIAMS \[ ... \]**

**Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 1, Panel One.**

**May 3, 1971.**

 

**\[ ... \]**

HOROWITZ, Chief Judge.

Defendants, husband and wife, were charged by information filed October
3, 1968, with the crime of manslaughter for negligently failing to
supply their 17-month child with necessary medical attention, as a
result of which he died on September 12, 1968. Upon entry of findings,
conclusions and judgment of guilty, sentences were imposed on April 22,
1969. Defendants appeal.

The defendant husband, Walter Williams, is a 24-year old full-blooded
Sheshont Indian with a sixth-grade education. His sole occupation is
that of laborer. The defendant wife, Bernice Williams, is a **\[ ...
\]** 20-year-old part Indian with an 11th grade education. At the time
of the marriage, the wife had two children, the younger of whom was a
14-month son. Both parents worked and the children were cared for by the
85-year-old mother of the defendant husband. The defendant husband
assumed parental responsibility with the defendant wife to provide
clothing, care and medical attention for the child. Both defendants
possessed a great deal of love and affection for the defendant wife\'s
young son.

The court expressly found:

That both defendants were aware that William Joseph **\[ ... \]**
Tabafunda was ill during the period September 1, 1968 to September 12,
1968. The defendants were ignorant. They did not realize how sick the
baby was. They thought that the baby had a toothache and no layman
regards a toothache as dangerous to life. They loved the baby and gave
it aspirin in hopes of improving its condition. They did not take the
baby to a doctor because of fear that the Welfare Department would take
the baby away from them. They knew that medical help was available
because of previous experience. They had no excuse that the law will
recognize for not taking the baby to a doctor.

The defendants Walter L. Williams and Bernice J. Williams were negligent
in not seeking medical attention for William Joseph Tabafunda.

That as a proximate result of this negligence, William Joseph Tabafunda
died.

**\[ ... \]**From these and other findings, the court concluded that the
defendants were each guilty of the crime of manslaughter as charged.

Defendants take no exception to findings but contend that the findings
do not support the conclusions that the defendants are guilty of
manslaughter as charged. **\[ ... \]**

Parental duty to provide medical care for a dependent minor child was
recognized at common law and characterized as a natural duty. **\[ ...
\]** On the question of the quality or seriousness of breach of the
duty, at common law, in the case of involuntary manslaughter, the breach
had to amount to more than mere ordinary or simple negligence\--gross
negligence was essential. **\[ ... \]** In Washington, however, RCW
9.48.060 [^\[2\]^](#X6c6b9e675509fbdccd1ea24c2470a463da479ca) (since
amended by Laws of 1970, ch. 49, § 2) and RCW 9.48.150
[^\[3\]^](#X76197f1b2a7143bd58ff28affb143310fc38a21) supersede both
voluntary and **\[ ... \]** involuntary manslaughter as those crimes
were defined at common law. Under these statutes the crime is deemed
committed even though the death of the victim is the proximate result of
only simple or ordinary negligence. **\[ ... \]**

The information charging statutory manslaughter made no mention of and
did not purport to restrict itself to the violation of the duty set
forth in RCW 26.20.030(1)(b). The information charged the violation of
\'the legal duty of providing necessary \* \* \* medical attention to
said \* \* \* minor child \* \* \*\' This general language permits
reliance upon the existence of the legal duty no matter from what source
derived. We have already pointed out that such a parental duty is
recognized in the decisions of this state and has been characterized as
a natural duty existing independently of statutes. **\[ ... \]**We
therefore hold that the violation of the parental duty to furnish
medical care to a minor dependent child, the other elements of
manslaughter being present, is a sufficient basis on which to rest a
conviction of the crime of manslaughter **\[ ... \]**

In the instant case, however, the defendant husband is not the father of
the minor child, nor has he adopted that child. Nevertheless, the
evidence shows that he had assumed responsibility with his wife for the
care and maintenance of the child, whom he greatly loved. Such
assumption of responsibility, characterized in the information as that
required of a \'guardian and custodian,\' is sufficient to impose upon
him the duty to furnish necessary medical care. **\[ ... \]**

The remaining issue of proximate cause requires consideration of the
question of when the duty to furnish medical care became activated. If
the duty to furnish such care was not activated until after it was too
late to save the life of the child, failure to furnish medical care
could not be said to have proximately caused the child\'s death.
Timeliness in the furnishing of medical care also must be considered in
terms of \'ordinary caution.\' The law does not mandatorily require that
a doctor be called for a child at the first sign of any indisposition or
illness. The indisposition or illness may appear to be of a minor or
very temporary kind, such as a toothache or cold. If one in the exercise
of ordinary caution fails to recognize that his child\'s symptoms
require medical attention, it cannot be said that the failure to obtain
such medical attention is a breach of the duty owed. **\[ ... \]**

Because of the serious nature of the charge against the parent and
step-parent of a well-loved child, and out of our concern for the
protection of the constitutional rights of the defendants, we have made
an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether it
substantially supports the court\'s express finding on proximate cause
and its implied finding that the duty to furnish medical care became
activated in time to prevent death of the child. **\[ ... \]**

Dr. Gale Wilson, the autopsy surgeon and chief pathologist for the King
County Coroner, testified that the child died because an abscessed tooth
had been allowed to develop into an infection of the mouth and cheeks,
eventually becoming gangrenous. This condition, accompanied by the
child\'s inability to eat, brought about malnutrition, lowering the
child\'s resistance and eventually producing pneumonia, causing the
death. Dr. Wilson testified that in his opinion **\[ ... \]** the
infection had lasted for approximately 2 weeks, and that the odor
generally associated with gangrene would have been present for
approximately 10 days before death. He also expressed the opinion that
had medical care been first obtained in the last week before the baby\'s
**\[ ... \]** death, such care would have been obtained too late to have
saved the baby\'s life. Accordingly, the baby\'s apparent condition
between September 1 and September 5, 1968 became the critical period for
the purpose of determining whether in the exercise of ordinary caution
defendants should have provided medical care for the minor child.

The testimony concerning the child\'s apparent condition during the
critical period is not crystal clear, but is sufficient to warrant the
following statement of the matter. The defendant husband testified that
he noticed the baby was sick about 2 weeks before the baby died. The
defendant wife testified that she noticed the baby was ill about a week
and a half or 2 weeks before the baby died. The evidence showed that in
the critical period the baby was fussy; that he could not keep his food
down; and that a cheek started swelling up. The swelling went up and
down, but did not disappear. In that same period, the cheek turned \'a
bluish color like.\' The defendants, not realizing that the baby was as
ill as it was or that the baby was in danger of dying, attempted to
provide some relief to the baby by giving the baby aspirin during the
critical period and continued to do so until the night before the baby
died. The defendants thought the swelling would go down and were waiting
for it to do so; and defendant husband testified, that from what he had
heard, neither doctors nor dentists pull out a tooth \'when it\'s all
swollen up like that.\' There was an additional explanation for not
calling a doctor given by each defendant. Defendant husband testified
that \'the way the cheek looked, \* \* \* and that stuff on his hair,
they would think we were neglecting him and take him away from us and
not give him back.\' Defendant wife testified that the defendants were
\'waiting for the swelling to go down,\' and also that they were afraid
to **\[ ... \]** take the child to a doctor for fear that the doctor
would report them to the welfare department, who, in turn, would take
the child away. \'It\'s just that I was so scared of losing him.\' They
testified that they had heard that the defendant husband\'s cousin lost
a child that way. The evidence showed that the defendants did not
understand the significance or seriousness of the baby\'s symptoms.
However, there is no evidence that the defendants were physically or
financially unable to obtain a doctor, or that they did not know an
available doctor, or that the symptoms did not continue to be a matter
of concern during the critical period. Indeed, the evidence shows that
in April 1968 defendant husband had taken the child to a doctor for
medical attention.

In our opinion, there is sufficient evidence from which the court could
find, as it necessarily did, that applying the standard of ordinary
caution, I.e., the caution exercisable by a man of reasonable prudence
under the same or similar conditions, defendants were sufficiently put
on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby\'s illness and lack of
improvement in the baby\'s apparent condition in the period from
September 1 to September 5, 1968 to have required them to have obtained
medical care for the child. The failure so to do in this case is
ordinary or simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to
support a conviction of statutory manslaughter.

The judgment is affirmed.

JOHNSON, J.,

delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Appellant caused a three-car collision, during which a passenger in one
of the other vehicles was killed. The grand jury indicted appellant for
criminally negligent homicide, alleging that she had made an unsafe lane
change and had failed to keep a proper lookout. A petit jury found
appellant guilty and also found that appellant's vehicle was a deadly
weapon. The jury assessed punishment of ten years' confinement in the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice, probated for ten years, and a
\$10,000 fine. On appeal, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals found the
evidence insufficient to sustain the conviction and rendered a judgment
of acquittal.[**\[ ... \]**](#X745129b01b86f6baabd623b19f34f8acdafb3ec)

After review, we find that the evidence was legally sufficient to
sustain appellant's conviction for criminally negligent homicide, and we
reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.

Facts

At approximately 8:30 p.m. on March 24, 2008, appellant was driving her
mid-size SUV in the center lane of the three-lane service road adjacent
to Interstate Highway 45 (IH-45) and talking on her cell phone. After
hanging up the phone, appellant realized that she had missed the
entrance ramp to IH-45, which diverged from the left lane of the service
road. Appellant abruptly swerved into the left lane to try to get onto
the ramp, even though the beginning of the solid-white-lined area on the
pavement between the ramp and the service road, often known as the
"safety barrier," was behind her. **\[ ... \]**

As appellant moved abruptly into the left lane, she cut off Cochise
Willis, who was driving his three-quarter-ton pickup truck in the left
lane of the service road. Willis testified that he was driving at the
speed limit --- 50 miles per hour-and that appellant was driving more
slowly than Willis when she moved into the left lane ahead of him.
Willis tried to slow down and get into the center lane, but he could not
avoid hitting the rear of appellant's SUV, slightly to the right of its
center. At the time of impact, appellant's vehicle was almost entirely
in the left lane, and Willis's truck was over the dividing line between
the left and center lanes. The collision caused appellant's vehicle to
rotate in a counterclockwise direction, crossing over the safety barrier
and onto the entrance ramp itself. The front of appellant's SUV struck
the passenger side of Terrell *Housley\'s* pickup truck, which had just
been driven onto the entrance ramp. Chance Wilcox was a passenger in the
truck. After the collision, Housley's truck rotated clockwise, causing
it to hit the curb that separates the entrance ramp and the safety
barrier and flip over, coming to a stop upside down. As Housley's truck
flipped, Wilcox was ejected, and he died at the scene from trauma to his
head and neck. At the same time, the collision with *Housley\'s* truck
caused appellant's SUV to flip onto its left side and skid to a stop.
Willis never lost control of his truck. He pulled into the emergency
lane of the service road and stopped.

The Court of Appeals's Opinion

The court of appeals found that the evidence was insufficient to
establish the requisite *mens rea* of criminal negligence, noting that

> the State presented evidence of appellant's use of a cell phone while
> driving, her unsafe lane change, and her failure to maintain a proper
> lookout. Only one of the three factors was a moving violation under
> Texas Law: making an unsafe lane change. However, the State placed
> primary emphasis on a factor that was not even listed in the
> indictment as proof of appellant's negligence: cell phone usage\....
> \[B\]y continuing that emphasis in this appeal, the State encourages
> this court to legislate through judicial fiat. Except under very
> limited circumstances not at issue in this case, using a cell phone
> while driving is not an illegal activity in Texas.[**\[ ...
> \]**](#X597046999199a713587dc326fa452249efb4f34)

Focusing on the prosecution's presentation of cell-phone use as a
primary factor establishing appellant's criminally negligent behavior,
the court of appeals found that the state introduced no competent
evidence that cell-phone use while driving increases the risk of fatal
accidents and held that, without evidence that such a risk was generally
known and disapproved of in the community, no reasonable fact finder
could find that using a cell phone while driving turned a simple moving
violation into criminally negligent homicide. Thus, the state had failed
to establish that appellant ought to have been aware of a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that death would result from her actions and that
her failure to perceive such a risk was a gross deviation from the
standard of ordinary care.

The state argues that, had the court of appeals used the correct
standard of review and viewed the evidence in the light most favorable
to the verdict, the court would have concluded that the evidence was
legally sufficient to sustain the conviction. The state contends that
the court of appeals relied on two incorrect theories of law: (1)
cell-phone use while driving does not constitute morally blameworthy
conduct and therefore does not justify criminal sanctions; and (2) the
negligent act in a criminally negligent homicide must itself be an
illegal act. The state contends that the court of appeals required
evidence of an increased risk of fatal crashes from cellphone use, but
such a risk is generally known and disapproved of in the community; the
dangers of driving while talking on a cell phone have been well known
for years and has even been criminalized in certain situations by the
Texas Legislature. And even though appellant violated at least one
traffic law when she made an unsafe lane change into the left lane, it
is not the law in Texas that the negligent act must be illegal.

Through the testimony of its witnesses and experts, and by
cross-examination of appellant's witnesses and experts, the state
presented evidence that: appellant was driving her SUV on the access
road of IH-45; the speed limit was 50 miles per hour; appellant was
driving more slowly than surrounding traffic; appellant was up to 92
feet past the beginning of the entrance ramp onto IH-45 when she
abruptly changed lanes; appellant did not signal the lane change or look
for other vehicles approaching in the left lane; and appellant intended
to enter IH-45 via the entrance ramp that she had already passed. The
state also presented evidence that, just before the accident, appellant
was driving and talking on her cell phone and that appellant admitted
using the cell phone

had distracted her. As Justice Hudson pointed out in his dissent in the
court of appeals, the state had no burden to show that driving while
using a cell phone is always risky or dangerous, or that it, of itself,
creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk, only that appellant's use
of a cell phone *in this case* created a substantial and unjustifiable
risk because it interfered with her ability to maintain a proper lookout
for other vehicles.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X596b2684f0d5c0fd2e1b6e55918408641fc4af7)

Given these circumstances, we find that a jury could have reasonably
concluded that appellant ought to have been aware of the substantial and
unjustifiable risk created by her actions. Appellant was driving at
speeds high enough to be lethal, should a collision occur. It is common
knowledge that failing to maintain a proper lookout and making an unsafe
lane change without signaling or checking for upcoming traffic poses a
great risk to other drivers on that road and that anyone sharing the
general community's sense of right and wrong would be aware of the
seriousness of doing so.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

Appellant argues that her conduct was not a gross deviation from the
ordinary standard of care and that she was subjected to criminal
liability for a common traffic accident with fatal results. The court of
appeals, again focusing on the lack of evidence presented regarding the
dangers of talking on a cell phone while driving, found that the use of
a cell phone while driving was such common practice that it would be
difficult for a rational fact finder to find it to be a gross deviation
from the ordinary standard of care.

The court of appeals mistakes what conduct was alleged to constitute the
gross deviation in this case. The gross deviation from the ordinary
standard of care argued by the state in this case was not appellant's
use of a cell phone, but rather that appellant made an unsafe lane
change and failed to maintain a proper lookout, at least partly as a
result of the distraction created by her use of the cell phone. The
state was not required to present evidence of the dangers of using a
cell phone while driving in order to carry its burden of proof, but such
a use of a cell phone may be considered as a factor in determining
whether a defendant grossly deviated from the ordinary standard of care.
The question of whether appellant's conduct was a "gross deviation" is a
question to be answered by the fact finder and here, a rational jury
could conclude that it was. **\[ ... \]**

Cell Phone Use

In its first ground, the state argues that the court of appeals erred in
holding that cell-phone use while driving does not constitute morally
blameworthy conduct and does not justify criminal sanctions. The morally
blameworthiness of cell-phone use while driving, by itself, is not the
issue in this case, and we will therefore not address it. It is within
the purview of the legislature, not the courts, to determine what does
and does not justify criminal sanctions.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X76d14ddfa34abaa7dc520d70f117f2f60d8c365)

Illegality of the Underlying Act

In its second ground, the state contends that the court of appeals erred
in presuming that the negligent act in a criminally negligent homicide
must itself be an illegal act. We do not read the court of appeals's
opinion to presume that the underlying act must itself be illegal. In
footnote 10, the court of appeals listed a number of clearly
legal-yet-distracting activities that, under the proper circumstances,
may cause *negligent* driving.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X5a2fa830623877fa7d2f4a1d6d2ec4bb4ae41b5) By including such a
list, the court of appeals clearly did not presume that the negligent
act must violate Texas law. Instead, in considering whether a finding of
a gross deviation from the standard of care was supported by the record,
the court of appeals mistakenly focused on the absence in the record of
any fact witnesses or scientific studies showing that cell-phone use
while driving increases the risk of fatal accidents. **\[ ... \]**

Conclusion

We hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's
verdict of guilty of criminally negligent homicide. We vacate the
judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the court of
appeals so that it may address appellant's remaining points of error.

Questions Regarding Welansky, Williams & Montgomery

 

1\. Does Welansky really meet the test for recklessness of a \"conscious
disregard of a substantial risk with no justification\"? What evidence
is there that he was aware of the risk of hundreds of people dying in a
fire?

2\. Are there reasons why the Williams did not demonstrate \"caution
exercisable by a man of reasonable prudence under the same or similar
conditions\"? Put another way, is there an argument that their actions
in not going to the doctor were reasonable, maybe even more risk-averse,
because of their circumstances?

3\. The Montgomery court declines to make a rule saying that (handheld?)
use of a cell phone while driving is per se negligence. What are the
pros and cons of such a rule?

Commonwealth v. Malone

 

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

354 Pa. 180

Appeal, No. 230

1946-05-27

This is an appeal from the judgment and sentence under a conviction of
murder in the second degree. William H. Long, age 13 years, was killed
by a shot from a 32-caliber revolver held against his right side by the
defendant, then aged 17 years. These youths were on friendly terms at
the time of the homicide. The defendant and his mother, while his father
and brother were in the U. S. Armed Forces, were residing in Lancaster,
Pa., with the family of William H. Long, whose son was the victim of the
shooting.

On the evening of February 26, 1945, when the defendant went to a moving
picture theater, he carried in the pocket of his raincoat a revolver
which he had obtained at the home of his uncle on the preceding day. In
the afternoon preceding the shooting, the decedent procured a cartridge
from his father's room and he and the defendant placed it in the
revolver.

After leaving the theater, the defendant went to a dairy store and there
met the decedent. Both youths sat in the rear of the store ten minutes,
during which period the defendant took the gun out of his pocket and
loaded the chamber to the right of the firing pin and then closed the
gun. A few minutes later, both youths sat on stools in front of the
lunch counter and ate some food. The defendant suggested to the decedent
that they play "Russian Poker".[^97] Long replied: "I don't care; *go
ahead*". The defendant then placed the revolver against the right side
of Long and pulled the trigger three times. The third pull resulted in a
fatal wound to Long. The latter jumped off the stool and cried: "Oh! Oh!
Oh!" and Malone said: "Did I hit you, Billy? Gee, Kid, I'm sorry." Long
died from the wounds two days later.

The defendant testified that the gun chamber he loaded was the first one
to the right of the firing chamber and that when he pulled the trigger
he did not "expect to have the gun go off". He declared he had *no*
intention of harming Long, who was his friend and companion. The
defendant was indicted for murder, tried and found guilty *of murder* in
the second degree and sentenced to a term in the penitentiary for a
period not less than five years and not exceeding ten years. A new trial
was refused and after sentence was imposed, an appeal was taken.

**\[ ... \]**At common law, the "grand criterion" which "distinguished
murder from other killing" was malice on the part of the killer and this
malice was not necessarily "malevolent *to the deceased* particularly"
but "any evil design in general; the dictate of a wicked, depraved and
malignant heart": 4 Blackstone 199. Among the examples that Blackstone
cites of murder is "coolly discharging a gun among a multitude of
people", causing the death of someone of the multitude.

In Pennsylvania, the *common law* crime *of murder* is divided into two
degrees, and murder *of the* *second* degree includes every element
which enters into first degree murder except the intention to kill**\[
... \]** When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for
which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to
result, he exhibits that "wickedness of disposition; hardness of heart;
cruelty; *recklessness of* consequences and a mind regardless of social
duty" which proved that there was at that time in him "that state or
frame of mind termed malice".[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xdbeb62740ad32e52491c205d55e984984a7baa0) This court has declared
that if a driver "wantonly, recklessly and in disregard of consequences"
hurls "his car against another or into a crowd" and death results from
that act "he ought to face the same consequences that would be meted out
to him if he had accomplished death by wantonly and wickedly firing a
gun"**\[ ... \]**

"Malice in law means a depraved and wicked heart that is reckless and
disregards the rights of others. Reckless conduct that results in the
death of another is malice. To illustrate that: If a man fires a gun
into a crowd and kills another it is murder, because the fact of the
reckless shooting of a gun into a crowd is malice in law. That wicked
and depraved disposition and. that recklessness and disregard of human
life is malice."

**\[ ... \]**"When a man uses a gun loaded with powder and shot and
aimed at a vital part of the body of another and discharges it, he must
be presumed to know that death is likely to follow." **\[ ...
\]**"Malice will be implied from conduct, recklessness of consequences,
or the cruelty of the crime".

**\[ ... \]**Trial judges should make it clear to the jury that an
unlawful killing in order to constitute murder must result from an
intentional, felonious act and not merely from an *inadvertent* or
*negligent* act. **\[ ... \]**

The killing *of* William H. Long by this defendant resulted from an act
intentionally, done\'by the latter, in reckless and wanton-disregard of
the consequences which were at least sixty per cent certain from his
thrice attempted discharge of a gun known to contain one bullet and
aimed at a vital part of Long's body. This killing was, therefore,
murder, for malice in the sense of a wicked disposition is evidenced by
the intentional doing of an uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its
likely harmful effects on others. The fact that there was no motive for
this homicide does not exculpate the accused. In a trial for murder
proof of motive is always relevant but never necessary.

\[862 NYS2d 20\]

Tom, J.P.

This appeal raises the issue of whether a death resulting from
defendant's operation of a motor vehicle at a high rate of speed through
the streets of lower Manhattan, while severely impaired by alcohol
intoxication, supports his conviction of depraved indifference murder
(Penal Law § 125.25 \[2\]). **\[ ... \]**

On June 14, 2004 at 2:00 a.m., Robert Smith drove from his home in
Nassau County to the Fulton Fish Market, where he ran a wholesale
seafood business. He was accompanied by his daughter, Judith
Gubernikoff, 37 years of age, who had begun working for the family
business that month after moving from Chicago to New York with her
husband, Dr. George Guberni-koff, and their three young children so that
Dr. Gubernikoff could accept a position at a Long Island hospital. **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

At approximately 2:55 a.m., Martin Clemente was in his Dodge Caravan in
the westbound lane of Grand Street, facing the intersection with Allen
Street, waiting for the light to change. **\[ ... \]** *Looking*
straight ahead towards the traffic light with an unobstructed view of
the intersection, he observed a Saturn proceeding south on Allen Street
at about 30 miles an hour into the intersection. Suddenly, a blue
minivan "came out of nowhere" from the easterly direction on Grand
Street, going "very fast," and without braking or slowing down entered
the intersection against a red light. The front end of the van struck
the passenger side of the Saturn. **\[ ... \]**"The Saturn went up in
the air," propelled end over end, "doing a three-sixty, hit the floor,
did another three-sixty," and landed on the fence of the divider on the
northbound side of Allen Street.

After calling 911 to report the accident, Clemente went over to the
Saturn. Smith appeared to be in shock, and Judith *Gubernikoff* was
unconscious. Her seat was "crushed together" with the driver's seat, and
both seats were tilted backwards, "so she was trying to gasp for air
with her head back." From a distance of about 25 feet, Clemente watched
defendant get out of the driver's side of the minivan. He appeared
"dizzy" and was "walking around in circles."

**\[ ... \]** As the sound of ambulance sirens became audible, defendant
attempted to "run away," "zigzagging" along Grand Street towards
Eldridge Street. **\[ ... \]** Although defendant was mumbling
incomprehensibly, he did not appear to have sustained injury.

**\[ ... \]**

Ms. Gubernikoff **\[ ... \]**was pronounced dead on the operating table
at 4:50 a.m.

Robert Smith **\[ ... \]**was unable to return to work for approximately
six months and experienced memory deficits, difficulty walking and
climbing, and reduced stamina for months after the crash.

Two blood samples were obtained from defendant at about 5:00 a.m. on the
morning of the accident.**\[ ... \]**Analysis of the two samples
revealed a blood alcohol concentration of .25% and .27%, respectively.
**\[ ... \]**

The trial court, in a nonjury trial, refused to permit a psychologist to
testify that, based on his examination, defendant suffered from chronic
alcoholism, rejecting defendant's argument that this condition bore on
his capacity to formulate the mens rea necessary for depraved
indifference murder. Rather, the court held that voluntary intoxication
is not a material consideration with respect to a crime involving
reckless behavior.

The court found defendant guilty of murder in the second degree for
causing the death of Judith Gubernikoff as a result of his reckless and
wanton conduct. The court further found defendant guilty of assault in
the first degree for "causing serious physical injury to Mr. Robert
Smith that was occasioned by the same recklessness and indifference to
human life that resulted in Mrs. Gubernikoff s death." Defendant was
also found guilty of all lesser noninclusory concurrent counts in the
indictment--- vehicular manslaughter in the second degree, vehicular
assault in the second degree and assault in the second degree. On July
29, 2005, the court sentenced defendant to a cumulative concurrent term
of imprisonment of 17 years to life.

On appeal, defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to
sustain conviction of murder in the second degree and assault in the
first degree because it failed to establish that his conduct was so
morally deficient and devoid of concern for life as to warrant exposing
him to the same criminal liability that the law imposes for intentional
conduct **\[ ... \]**he argues that the evidence fails to show, even
circumstantially, that he was capable of formulating the mens rea that
delineates depraved indifference murder because his extreme intoxication
rendered him "incapable of possessing the culpable mental state
necessary to prove depraved indifference" (quoting *People v Coon,* 34
AD3d 869, 870 \[2006\]). He maintains that the trial court erred in
refusing to receive relevant testimony concerning his chronic
alcoholism. Finally, defendant asserts that even **\[ ... \]**his
conduct falls far short of the extreme recklessness of drivers found
similarly culpable, who generally appeared to be well aware of the risks
they posed to others *(e.g. People v* Gomez, 65 NY2d 9 \[1985\]
\[driving on sidewalk at high speed\]; *People v Williams,* 184 AD2d 437
\[1992\], *lv denied* 80 NY2d 935 \[1992\] \[high-speed chase through
construction site\]). Defendant's contentions are unavailing.

Depraved indifference murder is committed when, "\[u\]nder circumstances
evincing a depraved indifference to human life," a person "recklessly
engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another
person, and thereby causes the death of another person" (Penal Law §
125.25 \[2\]). Similarly, assault in the first degree under a depraved
indifference theory is committed when, "\[u\]nder circumstances evincing
a depraved indifference to human life," a person "recklessly engages in
conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and
thereby causes serious physical injury to another person" (Penal Law §
120.10 \[3\]). A person acts recklessly "when he is aware of and
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk" (Penal Law
§ 15.05 \[3\]). **\[ ... \]**

The evidence adduced in this case overwhelmingly supports defendant's
conviction of depraved indifference murder and depraved indifference
assault. Having chosen to drive while heavily intoxicated, defendant
proceeded to drive in an extremely reckless manner, creating a grave
risk of death to pedestrians and other drivers in a densely populated
area of lower Manhattan.

The People's proof showed that defendant was driving at a speed of
between 50 and 60 miles an hour and speeding through red lights before
entering the subject intersection against a red traffic signal and
plowing into Smith's Saturn. Defendant was operating a motor vehicle
while, by his own admission, "barely *conscious* due to his
intoxication,"[**\[ ... \]**](#Xe48e4bcfaf52727fff58df7e79a52610356797a)
and analysis showed his blood alcohol level was close to three times the
legal limit. Falek observed defendant "flying" through several red
lights and hitting a parked car, and Clemente observed defendant's van
coming out of nowhere, traveling "very fast" as it entered the
intersection. Detective Rooney, based on his training and experience,
estimated that the van had been traveling at 50 to 55 miles an hour, and
possibly as high as 60 miles an hour, an opinion supported both by the
damage to the vehicles and by the testimony of eyewitnesses. The impact
between defendant's minivan and Smith's Saturn was sufficiently severe
to cause the Saturn to become airborne and flip end over end two times
before landing on top of a fence located on the median island. Defendant
made no attempt to brake before hitting the Saturn, as indicated by the
absence of pre-crash skid marks.

**\[ ... \]**

Further, while extremely intoxicated, defendant was not so impaired that
he was unaware of what he had done, as indicated by his attempt to flee
from the scene of the crash and his struggle with those who thwarted his
escape. Moreover, it was conceded that defendant had previously attended
a rehabilitative course for intoxicated drivers, which certainly would
have alerted him to the grave danger that drinking and driving poses to
others.

**\[ ... \]**

Penal Law § 15.05 (3) expressly precludes evidence of intoxication as a
defense to a reckless crime, providing that "\[a\] person who creates
such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary
intoxication also acts recklessly." Thus, defendant's intoxication at
the time of the collision, no matter how debilitating, is immaterial, as
is his history of chronic alcoholism, and the trial court properly
declined to consider such evidence.

The act of driving a vehicle while in a highly intoxicated state, at
high speed, on city streets, ignoring traffic signals and failing to
stop after striking a parked vehicle, demonstrates reckless conduct that
created a grave risk of death to others so as to constitute depraved
indifference to human life.

**\[ ... \]**

The mens rea of depraved indifference in this case is established by
circumstantial evidence demonstrating that defendant made a conscious
decision to drink and then, after consuming an excessive amount of
alcohol to the point of becoming "totally wasted," to drive on city
streets at a high rate of speed through red traffic lights, thereby
creating a grave risk of death to pedestrians and occupants of other
vehicles. **\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (Richard
D. Carruthers, J.), rendered June 29, 2005, convicting defendant, after
a nonjury trial, of murder in the second degree, assault in the first
degree, vehicular manslaughter in the second degree, assault in the
second degree, and vehicular assault in the second degree, and
sentencing defendant to concurrent terms of 17 years on the murder
conviction, 15 years on the first-degree assault conviction, 7 years on
the second-degree assault conviction, *2 1/3* to 7 years on the
vehicular manslaughter conviction, and *1 1/3* to 4 years on the
second-degree vehicular assault conviction, should be affirmed.

only two (pretty short) cases and then numerous news articles describing
the felony murder rule and various paths to change\--whether via
legislature, court decision, or more \"collateral\" attack

People v. Stamp

 

Court of Appeal of the State of California

1969-12-01

COBEY, Acting P. J.

These are appeals by Jonathan Earl Stamp, Michael John Koory and Billy
Dean Lehman, following jury verdicts of guilty of robbery and murder,
both in the first degree. Each man was given a life sentence on the
murder charge together with the time prescribed by law on the robbery
count.

 

On this appeal appellants primarily rely upon their position that the
felony-murder doctrine should not have been applied in this case due to
the unforeseeability of Honeyman's death.

The Facts

Defendants Koory and Stamp, armed with a gun and a blackjack, entered
the rear of the building housing the offices of General
Amusement ✎Company, ordered the✎ employees they found there to go to the
front of the premises, where the two secretaries were working. Stamp,
the one with the gun, then went into the office of Carl Honeyman, the
owner and manager. Thereupon Honeyman, looking very frightened and pale,
emerged from the office in a "kind of hurry." He was apparently
propelled by Stamp who had hold of him by an elbow.

The robbery victims were required to lie down on the floor while the
robbers took the money and fled out the back door. As the robbers, who
had been on the premises 10 to 15 minutes, were leaving, they told the
victims to remain on the floor for five minutes so that no one would
"get hurt." . . .

15 or 20 minutes after the robbery had occurred, \[one of the employees,
Honeyman\] collapsed on the floor. At 11:25 he was pronounced dead on
arrival at the hospital. The coroner's report listed the immediate cause
of death as heart attack.

The employees noted that during the hours before the
robbery Honeyman had appeared to be in normal health and good spirits.
The victim was an obese, 60-year-old man, with a history of heart
disease, who was under a great deal of pressure due to the intensely
competitive nature of his business. Additionally, he did not take good
care of his heart.

Three doctors, including the autopsy surgeon, Honeyman's physician, and
a professor of cardiology from U.C.L.A., testified that although
Honeyman had an advanced case of atherosclerosis, a progressive and
ultimately fatal disease, there must have been some immediate upset to
his system which precipitated the attack. It was their conclusion in
response to a hypothetical question that but for the robbery there would
have been no fatal seizure at that time. The fright induced by the
robbery was too much of a shock to Honeyman's system. There was opposing
expert testimony to the effect that it could not be said with reasonable
medical certainty that fright could ever be fatal. . .

Application of the Felony-murder Rule

Under the felony-murder rule of section 189 of the Penal Code, a killing
committed in either the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate
robbery is murder of the first degree. This is true whether the killing
is wilfull, deliberate and premeditated, or merely accidental or
unintentional, and whether or not the killing is planned as a part of
the commission of the robbery. . .

Under this rule no intentional act is necessary other than the attempt
to or the actual commission of the robbery itself. When a robber enters
a place with a deadly weapon with the intent to commit robbery, malice
is shown by the nature of the crime. ✎

There is no requirement that the killing occur, "while committing" or
"while engaged in" the felony, or that the killing be "a part of" the
felony, other than that the few acts be a part of one continuous
transaction. ✎ Thus the homicide need not have been committed "to
perpetrate" the felony. ✎

The doctrine is not limited to those deaths which are
foreseeable.✎ Rather a felon is held strictly liable for *all *killings
committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony.  So
long as a victim's predisposing physical condition, regardless of its
cause, is not the *only *substantial factor bringing about his death,
that condition, and the robber's ignorance of it, in no way destroys the
robber's criminal responsibility for the death. ✎ So long as life is
shortened as a result of the felonious act, it does not matter that the
victim might have died soon anyway. ✎ In this respect, the robber takes
his victim as he finds him.

\[ ... \]

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether a complex statistical study that
indicates a risk that racial considerations enter\[ ... \]into capital
sentencing determinations proves that petitioner McCleskey\'s capital
sentence is unconstitutional under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment.

## I

McCleskey, a black man, was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and
one count of murder in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, on
October 12, 1978. McCleskey\'s convictions arose out of the robbery of a
furniture store and the killing of a white police officer during the
course of the robbery. The evidence at trial indicated that McCleskey
and three accomplices planned and carried out the robbery. All four were
armed. McCleskey entered the front of the store while the other three
entered the rear. McCleskey secured the front of the store by rounding
up the customers and forcing them to lie face down on the floor. The
other three rounded up the employees in the rear and tied them up with
tape. The manager was forced at gunpoint to turn over the store
receipts, his watch, and \$6. During the course of the robbery, a police
officer, answering a silent alarm, entered the store through the front
door. As he was walking down the center aisle of the store, two shots
were fired. Both struck the officer. One hit him in the face and killed
him.

\[ ... \]

\[ ... \] The jury convicted McCleskey of
murder.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xabee4a5ea505d33048497148b9aefa13019184d)At the
penalty
hearing,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X113660ed0f5b72ac11648d027274c6ea361e1d3) the

followed the jury\'s recommendation and sentenced McCleskey to
death.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X662b8ef50c3302bd7c42194c279b14dd1f293ab)

\[ ... \]

## II

 

McCleskey\'s first claim is that the Georgia capital punishment statute
violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xa09a2c41a5901b838a33194a8a5da0d9edaa2dc)He
argues that race has infected the administration of Georgia\'s statute
in two ways: persons who murder whites are more likely to be sentenced
to death than persons who murder blacks, and black murderers are more
likely to be sentenced to death than white
murderers.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X03b3970c2e70ac0ccf9dcddf64ec7bf99fc324b)As a
black defendant who killed a white victim, McCleskey claims that the
Baldus study demonstrates that he was discriminated against because of
his race and because of the race of his victim. In its broadest form,
McCleskey\'s claim of discrimination extends to every actor in the
Georgia capital sentencing process, from the prosecutor who sought the
death penalty and the jury that imposed the sentence, to the State
itself that enacted the capital punishment statute and allows it to
remain in effect despite its allegedly discriminatory application. \[
... \]

## A

 

Our analysis begins with the basic principle that a defendant who
alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving \"the
existence of purposeful discrimination.\" \[ ... \] Thus, to prevail
under the Equal Protection Clause, McCleskey must prove that the
decisionmakers in *his* case acted with discriminatory purpose. He
offers no evidence specific to his own case that would support an
inference that racial\[ ... \] considerations played a part in his
sentence. Instead, he relies solely on the Baldus
study.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xcdf93b689481889bf62477ae8d553809cef2dab)McCleskey
argues that the Baldus study compels an inference that his sentence
rests on purposeful discrimination. McCleskey\'s claim that these
statistics are sufficient proof of discrimination, without regard to the
facts of a particular case, would extend to all capital cases in
Georgia, at least where the victim was white and the defendant is black.

The Court has accepted statistics as proof of intent to discriminate in
certain limited contexts. First, this Court has accepted statistical
disparities as proof of an equal protection violation in the selection
of the jury venire in a particular district. Although statistical proof
normally must present a \"stark\" pattern to be accepted as the sole
proof of discriminatory intent under the
Constitution,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xcdae9a6e4e47d626fa22aed84d3f1a29673d067)*Arlington
Heights* v. \[294\] *Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,* 429 U. S. 252,
266 (1977), \"\[b\]ecause of the nature of the jury-selection task, . .
. we have permitted a finding of constitutional violation even when the
statistical pattern does not approach \[such\] extremes.\" *Id.,* at
266, n.
13.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X5696d41dc86f1b96a3f98d8856ea73df7009336)Second,
this Court has accepted statistics in the form of multiple-regression
analysis to prove statutory violations under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. *Bazemore* v. *Friday,* 478 U. S. 385, 400-401
(1986) (opinion of BRENNAN, J., concurring in part).

But the nature of the capital sentencing decision, and the relationship
of the statistics to that decision, are fundamentally different from the
corresponding elements in the venire-selection or Title VII cases. Most
importantly, each particular decision to impose the death penalty is
made by a petit jury selected from a properly constituted venire. Each
jury is unique in its composition, and the Constitution requires that
its decision rest on consideration of innumerable factors that vary
according to the characteristics of the individual defendant and the
facts of the particular capital offense. \[ ... \] Thus, the application
of an inference drawn from the general statistics to a specific decision
in a trial and sentencing simply is not comparable to the application of
an inference drawn from general statistics to a specific
venire-selection\[ ... \]or Title VII case. In those cases, the
statistics relate to fewer
entities,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xbf1c87d0096fe4fdae79d6b714661d2b714d8e3) and
fewer variables are relevant to the challenged
decisions.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xd77566fa3c246c90c86d7731310f34e26be71d8)

\[ ... \]

McCleskey challenges decisions at the heart of the State\'s criminal
justice system.\[ ... \]Because discretion is essential to the criminal
justice process, we would demand exceptionally clear proof before we
would infer that the discretion has been abused. The unique nature of
the decisions at issue in this case also counsels against adopting such
an inference from the disparities indicated by the Baldus study.
Accordingly, we hold that the Baldus study is clearly insufficient to
support an inference that any of the decisionmakers in McCleskey\'s case
acted with discriminatory purpose.

## B

 

McCleskey also suggests that the Baldus study proves that the State as a
whole has acted with a discriminatory purpose. He appears to argue that
the State has violated the Equal\[ ... \] Protection Clause by adopting
the capital punishment statute and allowing it to remain in force
despite its allegedly discriminatory application. \[ ... \] For this
claim to prevail, McCleskey would have to prove that the Georgia
Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute *because of*
an anticipated racially discriminatory effect. \[ ... \] There was no
evidence then, and there is none now, that the Georgia Legislature
enacted the capital punishment statute to further a racially
discriminatory
purpose.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X5bfb818388fa70c710e847c2989d7e54d60681f)

Nor has McCleskey demonstrated that the legislature maintains the
capital punishment statute because of the racially disproportionate
impact suggested by the Baldus study. As legislatures necessarily have
wide discretion in the choice of criminal laws and penalties, and as
there were \[ ... \]legitimate reasons for the Georgia Legislature to
adopt and maintain capital punishment, \[ ... \] we will not infer a
discriminatory purpose on the part of the State of
Georgia.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xe841faf88f15913a3a09ee95ccdc78021177ca6)Accordingly,
we reject McCleskey\'s equal protection claims.

## III

 

McCleskey also argues that the Baldus study demonstrates that the
Georgia capital sentencing system violates the Eighth
Amendment.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xa8c5e7c5e508451ec17360b2fa3918b111e5cff)We
begin our analysis of this claim by reviewing the restrictions on death
sentences established by our prior decisions under that Amendment.

## A

 

The Eighth Amendment prohibits infliction of \"cruel and unusual
punishments.\" \[ ... \]

 

Although our decision in *Gregg* as to the facial validity of the
Georgia capital punishment statute appears to foreclose McCleskey\'s
disproportionality argument, he further contends that the Georgia
capital punishment system is arbitrary and capricious in *application,*
and therefore his sentence is excessive, because racial considerations
may influence capital sentencing decisions in Georgia. \[ ... \]

Even Professor Baldus does not contend that his statistics *prove* that
race enters into any capital sentencing decisions or that race was a
factor in McCleskey\'s particular
case.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X9fb680960f430bfdff838aba9a820100fab4555)Statistics
at most may show only a likelihood that a particular factor entered into
some decisions. There is, of course, some risk of racial prejudice
influencing a jury\'s decision in a criminal case. There are similar
risks that other kinds of prejudice will influence other criminal
trials.\[ ... \] The question \[ ... \]\"is at what point that risk
becomes constitutionally unacceptable,\" \[ ... \] McCleskey asks us to
accept the likelihood allegedly shown by the Baldus study as the
constitutional measure of an unacceptable risk of racial prejudice
influencing capital sentencing decisions. This we decline to do.

Because of the risk that the factor of race may enter the criminal
justice process, we have engaged in \"unceasing efforts\" to eradicate
racial prejudice from our criminal justice system. \[ ... \] Our efforts
have been guided by our recognition that \"the inestimable privilege of
trial by jury . . . is a vital principle, underlying the whole
administration of criminal justice,\" \[ ... \] Thus, it is the jury
that is a criminal defendant\'s fundamental \"protection of life and
liberty against race or color prejudice.\"\[ ... \] Specifically, a
capital sentencing jury representative of a criminal defendant\'s
community assures a \" \`diffused impartiality,\' \" \[ ... \]in the
jury\'s task of \"express\[ing\] the conscience of the community on the
ultimate question of life or death,\" \[ ... \]

The capital sentencing decision requires the individual jurors to focus
their collective judgment on the unique characteristics of a particular
criminal defendant. It is not surprising that such collective judgments
often are difficult to explain. But the inherent lack of predictability
of jury decisions does not justify their condemnation. On the contrary,
it is the jury\'s function to make the difficult and uniquely human
judgments that defy codification and that \"buil\[d\] discretion,
equity, and flexibility into a legal system.\" H. Kalven & H. Zeisel,
The American Jury 498 (1966).

McCleskey\'s argument that the Constitution condemns the discretion
allowed decisionmakers in the Georgia capital sentencing system is
antithetical to the fundamental role of discretion in our criminal
justice system. Discretion in the criminal justice system offers
substantial benefits to the criminal defendant. Not only can a jury
decline to impose the death sentence, it can decline to convict or
choose to convict of a lesser offense. \[ ... \] Similarly, the capacity
of prosecutorial discretion \[ ... \] to provide individualized justice
is \"firmly entrenched in American law.\" \[ ... \] Of course, \"the
power to be lenient \[also\] is the power to discriminate,\" K. Davis,
Discretionary Justice 170 (1973), but a capital punishment system that
did not allow for discretionary acts of leniency \"would be totally
alien to our notions of criminal justice.\" *Gregg* v. *Georgia,* 428 U.
S., at 200, n. 50.

## C

 

At most, the Baldus study indicates a discrepancy that appears to
correlate with race. Apparent disparities in sentencing are an
inevitable part of our criminal justice
system.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X9da27dad854febb71cc6b3383bf3e5c0f80ec86) \[ ...
\] As this Court has recognized, any mode for determining guilt or
punishment \"has its weaknesses and the potential for misuse.\" \[ ...
\]Specifically, \"there can be \`no perfect procedure for deciding in
which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death.\' \"
\[ ... \]Despite these imperfections, our consistent rule has been that
constitutional guarantees are met when \"the mode \[for determining
guilt or punishment\] itself has been surrounded with safeguards to make
it as fair as possible.\" \[ ... \]Where the discretion that is
fundamental to our criminal process is involved, we decline to assume
that what is unexplained is invidious. In light of the safeguards
designed to minimize racial bias in the process, the fundamental value
of jury trial in our criminal justice system, and the benefits that
discretion provides to criminal defendants, we hold that the Baldus
study does not demonstrate a constitutionally significant risk of racial
bias affecting the Georgia capital sentencing
process.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X5b6ede5a7a986aa3c2d773739997bd412e7d1e7)

 

## V

 

Two additional concerns inform our decision in this case. First,
McCleskey\'s claim, taken to its logical conclusion,\[ ... \] throws
into serious question the principles that underlie our entire criminal
justice system. The Eighth Amendment is not limited in application to
capital punishment, but applies to all penalties.\[ ... \]Thus, if we
accepted McCleskey\'s claim that racial bias has impermissibly tainted
the capital sentencing decision, we could soon be faced with similar
claims as to other types of
penalty.[^\[\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xcae39da98cd12f66830b12d955b89402cd07965)Moreover,
the claim that his sentence\[ ... \] rests on the irrelevant factor of

gender.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X8c187b2053de02ff24330e3799edb9b931e880f)Similarly,
since McCleskey\'s claim relates to the race of his victim, other claims
could apply with equally logical force to statistical disparities that
correlate with the race or sex of other actors in the criminal justice
system, such as defense
attorneys[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X87f35c8c70b7368facbc6729dcd2ee88891ad7c)or
judges.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xd4c93ea6966a8eade4f4acbc3fcb41da9caa637) Also,
there is no logical reason that such a claim need be limited to racial
or sexual bias. If arbitrary and capricious punishment is the touchstone
under the Eighth Amendment, such a claim could --- at least in theory
--- be based upon any arbitrary variable, such as the defendant\'s
facial
characteristics,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X685e1eb5e9c2ab2e013f6b8d430ca89a7510f5d)or
the physical attractiveness of the defendant or the
victim,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xa4cad0f126cb9161fdf3fbae74e2eec60cae4e1) that
some statistical\[ ... \] study indicates may be influential in jury
decisionmaking. As these examples illustrate, there is no limiting
principle to the type of challenge brought by
McCleskey.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X608c7ceb079f3a3c10bd552d7e2a2768fe28792) The
Constitution does not require that a State eliminate any demonstrable
disparity that correlates with a potentially irrelevant factor in order
to operate a criminal justice system that includes capital punishment.
As we have stated specifically in the context of capital punishment, the
Constitution does not \"plac\[e\] totally unrealistic conditions on its
use.\" *Gregg* v. *Georgia,* 428 U. S., at 199, n. 50.

Second, McCleskey\'s arguments are best presented to the legislative
bodies. \[ ... \]It is the legislatures, the elected representatives of
the people, that are \"constituted to respond to the will and
consequently the moral values of the people.\" *Furman* v. *Georgia,*
408 U. S., at 383 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). Legislatures also are
better qualified to weigh and \"evaluate the results of statistical
studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of
approach that is not available to the courts,\" *Gregg* v. *Georgia,
supra,* at 186. Capital punishment is now the law in more than
two-thirds of our States. It is the ultimate duty of courts to determine
on a case-by-case basis whether these laws are applied consistently with
the Constitution. \[ ... \]

At some point in this case, Warren McCleskey doubtless asked his lawyer
whether a jury was likely to sentence him to die. A candid reply to this
question would have been disturbing. First, counsel would have to tell
McCleskey that few of the details of the crime or of McCleskey\'s past
criminal conduct were more important than the fact that his victim was
white.\[ ... \]Furthermore, counsel would feel bound to tell McCleskey
that defendants charged with killing white victims in Georgia are 4.3
times as likely to be sentenced to death as defendants charged with
killing blacks.\[ ... \]In addition, frankness would compel the
disclosure that it was more likely than not that the race of
McCleskey\'s victim would determine whether he received a death
sentence: 6 of every 11 defendants convicted of killing a white person
would not have received the death penalty if their victims had been
black,\[ ... \]while, among defendants with aggravating and mitigating
factors comparable to McCleskey\'s, 20 of every 34 would not have been
sentenced to die if their victims had been black. \[ ... \]Finally, the
assessment would not be complete without the information that cases
involving black defendants and white victims are more likely to result
in a death sentence than cases featuring any other racial combination of
defendant and victim. \[ ... \]

The Court today \[ ... \] finds no fault in a system in which lawyers
must tell their clients that race casts a\[ ... \]large shadow on the
capital sentencing process. \[ ... \]

## . . .

## B

 

he Court assumes the statistical validity of the Baldus study, and
acknowledges that McCleskey has demonstrated a risk that racial
prejudice plays a role in capital sentencing in Georgia, *ante,* at
\-\-\--, n. 7. Nonetheless, it finds the probability of prejudice
insufficient to create constitutional concern. *Ante,* at \-\-\--. Close
analysis of the Baldus study, however, in light of both statistical
principles and human experience, reveals that the risk that race
influenced McCleskey\'s sentence is intolerable by any imaginable
standard.The Baldus study indicates that, after taking into account some
230 nonracial factors that might legitimately influence a sentencer, the
jury *more likely than not* would have spared McCleskey\'s life had his
victim been black. \[ ... \]

The statistical evidence in this case thus relentlessly documents the
risk that McCleskey\'s sentence was influenced by racial considerations.
This evidence shows that there is a better than even chance in Georgia
that race will influence the decision to impose the death penalty: a
majority of defendants in white-victim crimes would not have been
sentenced to die if their victims had been black. In determining whether
this risk is acceptable, our judgment must be shaped by the awareness
that \"\[t\]he risk of racial prejudice infecting a capital sentencing
proceeding is especially serious in light of the complete finality of
the death sentence,\" \[ ... \]In determining the guilt of a defendant,
a State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, we
refuse to convict if the chance of error is simply less likely than not.
Surely, we should not be willing to take a person\'s life if the chance
that his death sentence was irrationally imposed is *more* likely than
not. In light of the gravity of the interest at stake, petitioner\'s
statistics on their face are a powerful demonstration of the type of
risk that our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has consistently condemned.

## C

 

\[ ... \]

This Court has invalidated portions of the Georgia capital sentencing
system three times over the past 15 years. \[ ... \]

it would be unrealistic to ignore the influence of history in assessing
the plausible implications of McCleskey\'s evidence. \"\[A\]mericans
share a historical experience that has resulted in individuals within
the culture ubiquitously attaching a significance to race that is
irrational and often outside their awareness.\" Lawrence, The Id, The
Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning With Unconscious Racism, 39 Stan.
L. \[333\] Rev. 327 (1987). \[ ... \]

Our cases reflect a realization of the myriad of opportunities for
racial considerations to influence criminal proceedings\[ ... \].

The discretion afforded prosecutors and jurors in the Georgia capital
sentencing system creates such opportunities.\[ ... \]

History and its continuing legacy thus buttress the probative force of
McCleskey\'s statistics.\[ ... \] \"subtle, less consciously held racial
attitudes\" continue to be of concern, 476 U. S., at 35, and the Georgia
system gives such attitudes considerable room to operate. The
conclusions drawn from McCleskey\'s statistical evidence are therefore
consistent with the lessons of social experience.

\[ ... \]The majority thus misreads our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence
in concluding that McCleskey has not demonstrated a degree of risk
sufficient to raise constitutional concern. The determination of the
significance of his evidence is at its core an exercise in human moral
judgment, not a mechanical statistical analysis. It must first and
foremost be informed by awareness of the fact that death is irrevocable,
and that as a result \"the qualitative difference of death from all
other punishments requires a greater degree of scrutiny of the capital
sentencing determination.\" *California* v. *Ramos,* 463 U. S., at
998-999. For this reason, we have demanded a uniquely high degree of
rationality in imposing the death penalty. A capital sentencing system
in which race more likely than not plays a role does not meet this
standard. It is true that every nuance of decision cannot be
statistically captured, nor can any individual judgment be plumbed with
absolute certainty. Yet the fact that we must always act without the
illumination of complete knowledge cannot induce paralysis when we
confront what is literally an issue of life and death. Sentencing data,
history, and experience all counsel that Georgia has provided
insufficient assurance of the heightened rationality we have required in
order to take a human life.

## \[ ... \]

Reliance on race in imposing capital punishment,\[ ... \] is
antithetical to the very rationale for granting sentencing discretion.
\[ ... \]

Considering the race of a defendant or victim in deciding if the death
penalty should be imposed is completely at odds with this concern that
an individual be evaluated as a unique human being. Decisions influenced
by race rest in part on a categorical assessment of the worth of human
beings according to color, insensitive to whatever qualities the
individuals in question may possess. \[ ... \]

\[ ... \]Our desire for individualized moral judgments may lead us to
accept some inconsistencies in sentencing outcomes. \[ ... \] There is
\[ ... \] a presumption that actors in the criminal justice system
exercise their discretion in responsible fashion, and we do not
automatically infer that sentencing patterns that do not comport with
ideal rationality are suspect.

As we made clear in *Batson* v. *Kentucky,* 476 U. S. 79 (1986),
however, that presumption is rebuttable. \[ ... \] The Court\'s position
converts a rebuttable presumption into a virtually conclusive one.

\[ ... \]

\[ ... \]The Court next states that its unwillingness to regard
petitioner\'s evidence as sufficient is based in part on the fear that
recognition of McCleskey\'s claim would open the door to widespread
challenges to all aspects of criminal sentencing. **Taken on its face,
such a statement seems to suggest a fear of too much justice. **

In fairness, the Court\'s fear that McCleskey\'s claim is an invitation
to descend a slippery slope also rests on the realization that any
humanly imposed system of penalties will exhibit some imperfection. Yet
to reject McCleskey\'s powerful evidence on this basis is to ignore both
the qualitatively different character of the death penalty and the
particular repugnance of racial discrimination, considerations which may
\[340\] properly be taken into account in determining whether various
punishments are \"cruel and unusual.\" \[ ... \]

It hardly needs reiteration that this Court has consistently
acknowledged the uniqueness of the punishment of death. \[ ... \]

The Court\'s projection of apocalyptic consequences for criminal
sentencing is thus greatly exaggerated. \[ ... \] Despite its acceptance
of the validity of Warren McCleskey\'s evidence, the Court is willing to
let his death sentence stand because it fears that we cannot
successfully define a different standard for lesser punishments. This
fear is baseless.

Finally, the Court justifies its rejection of McCleskey\'s claim by
cautioning against usurpation of the legislatures\' role in devising and
monitoring criminal punishment. \[ ... \] The fact that \"\[c\]apital
punishment is now the law in more than two thirds of our States,\"\[ ...
\]however, does not diminish the fact that capital punishment is the
most awesome act that a State can perform. The judiciary\'s role in this
society counts for little if the use of governmental power to extinguish
life does not elicit close scrutiny. \[ ... \]

## V

 

At the time our Constitution was framed 200 years ago this year, blacks
\"had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an
inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race,
either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they
had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\" *Dred Scott*
v. *Sandford,* \[344\] 19 How. 393, 407 (1857). Only 130 years ago, this
Court relied on these observations to deny American citizenship to
blacks. *Ibid.* A mere three generations ago, this Court sanctioned
racial segregation, stating that \"\[i\]f one race be inferior to the
other socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them
upon the same plane.\" *Plessy* v. *Ferguson,* 163 U. S. 537, 552
(1896).

In more recent times, we have sought to free ourselves from the burden
of this history. Yet it has been scarcely a generation since this
Court\'s first decision striking down racial segregation, and barely two
decades since the legislative prohibition of racial discrimination in
major domains of national life. These have been honorable steps, but we
cannot pretend that in three decades we have completely escaped the grip
of a historical legacy spanning centuries. Warren McCleskey\'s evidence
confronts us with the subtle and persistent influence of the past. His
message is a disturbing one to a society that has formally repudiated
racism, and a frustrating one to a Nation accustomed to regarding its
destiny as the product of its own will. Nonetheless, we ignore him at
our peril, for we remain imprisoned by the past as long as we deny its
influence in the present.

It is tempting to pretend that minorities on death row share a fate in
no way connected to our own, that our treatment of them sounds no echoes
beyond the chambers in which they die. Such an illusion is ultimately
corrosive, for the reverberations of injustice are not so easily
confined. \"The destinies of the two races in this country are
indissolubly linked together,\" *id.,* at 560 (Harlan, J., dissenting),
and the way in which we choose those who will die reveals the depth of
moral commitment among the living.

The Court today sanctions the execution of a man despite his
presentation of evidence that establishes a constitutionally intolerable
level of racially based discrimination leading to the imposition of his
death sentence. \[ ... \]

In sum, McCleskey has demonstrated a clear pattern of differential
treatment according to race that is \"unexplainable on grounds other
than race.\" *Arlington Heights* v. *Metropolitan Housing Development
Corp.,* 429 U. S., at 266.

## III

 

The Court\'s explanations for its failure to apply this well-established
equal protection analysis to this case are not persuasive. \[ ... \]

As discussed above, McCleskey presented evidence of numerous decisions
impermissibly affected by racial factors over a significant number of
cases. \[ ... \]

The Court\'s assertion that, because of the necessity of discretion in
the criminal justice system, it \"would demand exceptionally clear
proof,\" *ante,* at 297, before inferring abuse of that discretion thus
misses the point of the constitutional challenge in this case. \[ ... \]
As the Court concedes, discretionary authority can be discriminatory
authority. \[ ... \] Judicial scrutiny is particularly appropriate in
McCleskey\'s case because \"\[m\]ore subtle, less consciously held
racial attitudes could also influence\" the decisions in the Georgia
capital sentencing system. \[ ... \]The Court\'s rejection of
McCleskey\'s equal protection claims is\[ ... \] a far cry from the
\"sensitive inquiry\" mandated by the Constitution. . .

One of the final concerns discussed by the Court may be the most
disturbing aspect of its opinion. Granting relief to McCleskey in this
case, it is said, could lead to further constitutional challenges. \[
... \] That, of course, is no reason to deny *McCleskey* his rights
under the Equal Protection Clause. If a grant of relief to him were to
lead to a closer examination of the effects of racial considerations
throughout the criminal justice system, the system, and hence society,
might benefit. Where no such factors come into play, the integrity of
the system is enhanced. Where such considerations are shown to be
significant, efforts can be made to eradicate their impermissible
influence and to ensure an evenhanded application of criminal sanctions.

Supreme Court of the United States

**\[ ... \]**

Justice Stevens

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law's requirements for
criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit
crimes. Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment,
and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level
of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal
conduct. Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and
fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.
Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided *Penry*
v. *Lynaugh,* 492 U. S. 302 (1989), the American public, legislators,
scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the
death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal.
The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the
question presented by this case: whether such executions are "cruel and
unusual punishments" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution.

I

Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduction, armed
robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to death. At approximately
midnight on August 16, 1996, Atkins and William Jones, armed with a
semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on
his person, drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck
where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash, then took
him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.

**\[ ... \]**

In the penalty phase, the defense relied on one witness, Dr. Evan
Nelson, a forensic psychologist who had evaluated Atkins before trial
and concluded that he was "mildly mentally retarded."[^98] His
conclusion was based on interviews with people who knew Atkins,[^99] a
review of school and court records, and the administration of a standard
intelligence test which indicated that Atkins had a full scale IQ of 59.

The jury sentenced Atkins to death**\[ ... \]**. **\[ ... \]**

II

The Eighth Amendment succinctly prohibits "\[e\]xcessive" sanctions.
**\[ ... \]**

A claim that punishment is excessive is judged not by the standards that
prevailed in 1685 when Lord Jeffreys presided over the "Bloody Assizes"
or when the Bill of Rights was adopted, but rather by those that
currently prevail. **\[ ... \]**

Proportionality review under those evolving standards should be informed
by " 'objective factors to the maximum possible extent,' "**\[ ... \]**.
We have pinpointed that the "clearest and most reliable objective
evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the
country's legislatures." *Penry,* 492 U. S., at 331. Relying in part on
such legislative evidence, we have held that death is an impermissibly
excessive punishment for the rape of an adult woman, *Coker* v.
*Georgia,* 433 U. S. 584, 593-596 (1977), or for a defendant who neither
took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life, *Enmund*
v. *Florida,* 458 U. S. 782, 789-793 (1982). **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

III

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** In *\[1986\]*, the public reaction to the
execution of a mentally retarded murderer in Georgia apparently led to
the enactment of the first state statute prohibiting such executions. In
1988, when Congress enacted legislation reinstating the federal death
penalty, it expressly provided that a "sentence of death shall not be
carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded." In 1989, Maryland
enacted a similar prohibition.**\[ ... \]**

Much has changed since then. **\[ ... \]**In 1990, Kentucky and
Tennessee enacted statutes similar to those in Georgia and Maryland, as
did New Mexico in 1991, and Arkansas, Colorado, Washington, Indiana, and
Kansas in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, when New York reinstated its death
penalty, it emulated the Federal Government by expressly exempting the
mentally retarded. Nebraska followed suit in 1998. **\[ ... \]***\[I\]*n
2000 and 2001 six more States --- South Dakota, Arizona, Connecticut,
Florida, Missouri, and North Carolina-joined the procession. The Texas
Legislature unanimously adopted a similar bill, and bills have passed at
least one house in other States, including Virginia and Nevada.

It is not so much the number of these States that is significant, but
the consistency of the direction of change. **\[ ... \]**Moreover, even
in those States that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders,
the practice is uncommon.**\[ ... \]***\[O\]*nly five have executed
offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided Penry. The
practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say
that a national consensus has developed against it.[^100]

**\[ ... \]**

IV

This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the
relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders**\[ ... \]**.
Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental
retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that
our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.

**\[ ... \]**

*\[O\]*ur death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent
with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be
categorically excluded from execution. First, there is a serious
question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a
basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders. **\[
... \]** **\[ ... \]**

With respect to retribution**\[ ... \]**the severity of the appropriate
punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender. Since
*Gregg,* our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of
the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes. **\[
... \]**If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to
justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser
culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that
form of retribution. **\[ ... \]**

With respect to deterrence **\[ ... \]**the same cognitive and
behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpable
--- for example, the diminished ability to understand and process
information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning,
or to control impulses --- **\[ ... \]** also make it less likely that
they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a
penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that
information. **\[ ... \]**

The reduced capacity of mentally retarded offenders provides a second
justification for a categorical rule making such offenders ineligible
for the death penalty. The risk "that the death penalty will be imposed
in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty," *Lockett*
v. *Ohio,* 438 U. S. 586, 605 (1978), is enhanced, not only by the
possibility of false confessions,[^101] but also by the lesser ability
of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of
mitigation**\[ ... \]**. Mentally retarded defendants may be less able
to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor
witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of
lack of remorse for their crimes. As *Penry* demonstrated, moreover,
reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged
sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of
future dangerousness will be found by the jury. 492 U. S., at 323-325.
Mentally retarded defendants in the aggregate face a special risk of
wrongful execution.

Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree
with the judgment of "the legislatures that have recently addressed the
matter" and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a
mentally retarded criminal. **\[ ... \]***\[W\]*e therefore conclude
that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution "places a
substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life" of a
mentally retarded offender. **\[ ... \]**

*It is so ordered.*

Justice Scalia,

with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Today's decision fe the pinnacle of our Eighth Amendment
death-is-different jurisprudence. Not only does it, like all of that
jurisprudence, find no support in the text or history of the Eighth
Amendment; it does not even have support in current social attitudes
regarding the conditions that render an otherwise just death penalty
inappropriate. Seldom has an opinion of this Court rested so obviously
upon nothing but the personal views of its Members.

H-I

**\[ ... \]**

The Court **\[ ... \]**miraculously extracts a "national consensus"
forbidding execution of the mentally retarded, ante, at 316, from the
fact that 18 States --- less than *half* (47%) of the 38 States that
permit capital punishment (for whom the issue exists) --- have very
recently enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally retarded.
**\[ ... \]**

Our prior cases have generally required a much higher degree of
agreement before finding a punishment cruel and unusual on "evolving
standards" grounds. **\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

The Court attempts to bolster its embarrassingly feeble evidence of
"consensus" with the following: "It is not so much the number of these
States that is significant, but the *consistency* of the direction of
change." *Ante,* at 315 (emphasis added). But in what *other* direction
*could we possibly* see change? Given that 14 years ago *all* the death
penalty statutes included the mentally retarded, *any* change (except
precipitate undoing of what had just been done) was *bound* *to be* in
the one direction the Court finds significant enough to overcome the
lack of real consensus. **\[ ... \]**

Even less compelling (if possible) is the Court's argument, *ante,* at
316, that evidence of "national consensus" is to be found in the
infrequency with which retarded persons are executed in States that do
not bar their execution. **\[ ... \]***If* however, execution of the
mentally retarded *is* "uncommon"; and if it is not a sufficient
explanation of this that the retarded constitute a tiny fraction of
society (1% to 3%), Brief for American Psychological Association et al.
as *Amici Curiae* 7; then surely the explanation is that mental
retardation is a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor at
sentencing, *Penry,* 492 U. S., at 328. For that reason, even if there
were uniform national sentiment in *favor* of executing the retarded in
appropriate cases, one would still expect execution of the mentally
retarded to be "uncommon." **\[ ... \]**

But the Prize for the Court's Most Feeble Effort to fabricate "national
consensus" must go to its appeal (deservedly relegated to a footnote) to
the views of assorted professional and religious organizations, members

Beyond the empty talk of a "national consensus," the Court gives us a

power confined *neither* by the moral sentiments originally enshrined in
the Eighth Amendment (its original meaning) *nor even* by the current
moral sentiments of the American people. " '\[T\]he Constitution,' " the
Court says, "contemplates that in the end *our own judgment* will be
brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death
penalty under the Eighth Amendment.' " **\[ ... \]**The arrogance of
this assumption of power takes one's breath away. And it explains, of
course, why the Court can be so cavalier about the evidence of
consensus. **\[ ... \]**

under this Court's assumed power to invent a death-is-different
jurisprudence. **\[ ... \]**There is something to be said for popular
abolition of the death penalty; there is nothing to be said for its

**Norwegian Correctional Service**\
<https://www.kriminalomsorgen.no/information-in-english.265199.no.html>

The task of the Directorate of Norwegian Correctional Service is to
ensure a proper execution of remand and prison sentences, with due
regard to the security of all citizens and attempts to prevent
recidivism by enabling the offenders, through their own initiatives, to
change their criminal behaviour.

In pursuant to the Execution of Sentences Act, a sentence shall be
executed in a manner that takes into account the purpose of the
sentence; that serves to prevent the commission of new criminal acts,
that reassures society, and that within this framework ensures
satisfactory conditions for the prisoners. Thus the activity  of the
Correctional Service is based on due consideration to security, purpose
and the general sense of justice. Furthermore, all activities within the
Correctional Service are to be in accordance with our values:

§  Openness

§  Respect

§  Professionalism

§  Commitment

**Principle of normality in the Correctional Service**

§  The punishment is the restriction of liberty; no other rights have
been removed by the sentencing court. Therefore the sentenced offender
has all the same rights as all other who live in Norway.

§  No-one shall serve their sentence under stricter circumstances than
necessary for the security in the community. Therefore offenders shall
be placed in the lowest possible security regime.

§  During the serving of a sentence, life inside will resemble life
outside as much as possible.

...

**Progression towards reintegration**

In accordance with the principle of normality, progression through a
sentence should be aimed at  reentering to the community. The more
institutionalized a system is, the harder it will be to return to
freedom. Therefore, one will proceed towards release gradually from high
security prisons to lower security prisons, through halfway houses and
finally execution of the sentence outside of prison unless security
reasons dictate otherwise.

Probation is stimulated and the correctional services will  try to
arrange for a process where serving the sentence is adjusted to
individual risks, needs and resources, unless security reasons predict
otherwise.

**The contents of the sentence**

The Correctional services have the possibility to implement a sentence
by the court in various ways, and to provide it with various forms of
contents.

§  An unconditional imprisonment may be implemented by placement in
various types of security levels. In addition, there is a possibility to
serve one's sentence wholly or partially in a treatment or special care
institution when the prison system is unable to deal with the specific
type of problems the offender presents, for example with serious
addiction.

§  Under certain conditions up to half of an unconditional prison
sentence may be served at home

§  A full sentence of up to four months unconditional imprisonment may
be changed by the correctional services to home detention with
electronic monitoring by means of an ankle bracelet. The offender must
be active during daytime -- through school, work, etc. -- and at home at
given times. Any breach of conditions may lead to (re-)imprisonment.
Home detention with electronic monitoring is also possible as a
alternative for the last four months of a longer sentence.

§  It is possible to be released on probation after having served
two-thirds of the sentence and a minimum of 74 days. On probation, the
convicted person will need to report to the probation office at regular
times, refrain from the use of alcohol and comply to any other specific
conditions that have been imposed.

 

**MARK LEWIS and SARAH LYALL, "Norway Mass Killer Gets the Maximum: 21
Years," New York Times, AUG. 24, 2012**

OSLO --- Convicted of killing 77 people in a horrific bombing and
shooting attack in July last year, the Norwegian extremist Anders
Behring Breivik was sentenced on Friday to 21 years in prison --- fewer
than four months per victim --- ending a case that thoroughly tested
this gentle country's collective commitment to values like tolerance,
nonviolence and merciful justice.

Mr. Breivik, lawyers say, will live in a prison outside Oslo in a
three-cell suite of rooms equipped with exercise equipment, a television
and a laptop, albeit one without Internet access. If he is not
considered a threat after serving his sentence, the maximum available
under Norwegian law, he will be eligible for release in 2033, at the age
of 53.

However, his demeanor, testimony and declaration that he would have
liked to kill more people helped convince the judges that, however
lenient the sentence seems, Mr. Breivik is unlikely ever to be released
from prison. He could be kept there indefinitely by judges adding a
succession of five-year extensions to his sentence.

The relative leniency of the sentence imposed on Mr. Breivik, the worst
criminal modern Scandinavia has known, is no anomaly. Rather, it is
consistent with Norway's general approach to criminal justice. Like the
rest of Europe --- and in contrast with much of the United States, whose
criminal justice system is considered by many Europeans to be cruelly
punitive --- Norway no longer has the death penalty and considers prison
more a means for rehabilitation than retribution. ...

### STATE OF MARYLAND v. EDWARD SALVATORE RUSK

\[No. 142, September Term, 1979.\]

Court of Appeals of Maryland.

Decided January 13, 1981.

**\[ ... \]**

MURPHY, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court. **\[ ... \]**

Edward Rusk was found guilty by a jury in the Criminal **\[ ... \]**
Court of Baltimore (Karwacki, J. presiding) of second degree rape in
violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1980 Cum. Supp.),
Art. 27, § 463 (a) (1), which provides in pertinent part:

> \"A person is guilty of rape in the second degree if the person
> engages in vaginal intercourse with another person:
>
> \(1\) By force or threat of force against the will and without the
> consent of the other person; \....\"

On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals, sitting *en banc,* reversed the
conviction; it concluded by an 8 --- 5 majority that **\[ ...
\]**insufficient evidence of Rusk\'s guilt had been adduced at the trial
to permit the case to go to the jury. **\[ ... \]**

At the trial, the 21-year-old prosecuting witness, Pat, testified that
on the evening of September 21, 1977, she attended a high school alumnae
meeting where she met a girl friend, Terry. After the meeting, Terry and
Pat agreed to drive in their respective cars to Fells Point to have a
few drinks. On the way, Pat stopped to telephone her mother, who was
baby sitting for Pat\'s two-year-old son; she told her mother that she
was going with Terry to Fells Point and would not be late in arriving
home.

The women arrived in Fells Point about 9:45 p.m. They went to a bar
where each had one drink. After staying approximately one hour, Pat and
Terry walked several blocks to a second bar, where each of them had
another drink. After about thirty minutes, they walked two blocks to a
third bar known as E.J. Buggs. The bar was crowded and a band was
playing in the back. Pat ordered another drink and as she and Terry were
leaning against the wall, Rusk approached and said \"hello\" to Terry.
Terry, who was then conversing with another individual, momentarily **\[
... \]** interrupted her conversation and said \"Hi, Eddie.\" Rusk then
began talking with Pat and during their conversation both of them
acknowledged being separated from their respective spouses and having a
child. Pat told Rusk that she had to go home because it was a week-night
and she had to wake up with her baby early in the morning.

Rusk asked Pat the direction in which she was driving and after she
responded, Rusk requested a ride to his apartment. Although Pat did not
know Rusk, she thought that Terry knew him. She thereafter agreed to
give him a ride. Pat cautioned Rusk on the way to the car that \"\`I\'m
just giving a ride home, you know, as a friend, not anything to be, you
know, thought of other than a ride;\'\" and he said, \"\`Oh, okay.\'\"
They left the bar between 12:00 and 12:20 a.m.

Pat testified that on the way to Rusk\'s apartment, they continued the
general conversation that they had started in the bar. After a
twenty-minute drive, they arrived at Rusk\'s apartment in the 3100 block
of Guilford Avenue. Pat testified that she was totally unfamiliar with
the neighborhood. She parked the car at the curb on the opposite side of
the street from Rusk\'s apartment but left the engine running. Rusk
asked Pat to come in, but she refused. He invited her again, and she
again declined. She told Rusk that she could not go into his apartment
even if she wanted to because she was separated from her husband and a
detective could be observing her movements. Pat said that Rusk was fully
aware that she did not want to accompany him to his room.
Notwithstanding her repeated refusals, Pat testified that Rusk reached
over and turned off the ignition to her car and took her car keys. He
got out of the car, walked over to her side, opened the door and said,
\"\`Now, will you come up?\'\" Pat explained her subsequent actions:

> \"At that point, because I was scared, because he had my car keys. I
> didn\'t know what to do. I was someplace I didn\'t even know where I
> was. It was in the city. I didn\'t know whether to run. I really
> didn\'t think, at that point, what to do.
>
> \"Now, I know that I should have blown the horn. I should have run.
> There were a million things I **\[ ... \]** could have done. I was
> scared, at that point, and I didn\'t do any of them.\"

Pat testified that at this moment she feared that Rusk would rape her.
She said: \"\[I\]t was the way he looked at me, and said \`Come on up,
come on up;\' and when he took the keys, I knew that was wrong.\"

It was then about 1 a.m. Pat accompanied Rusk across the street into a
totally dark house. She followed him up two flights of stairs. She
neither saw nor heard anyone in the building. Once they ascended the
stairs, Rusk unlocked the door to his one-room apartment, and turned on
the light. According to Pat, he told her to sit down. She sat in a chair
beside the bed. Rusk sat on the bed. After Rusk talked for a few
minutes, he left the room for about one to five minutes. Pat remained
seated in the chair. She made no noise and did not attempt to leave. She
said that she did not notice a telephone in the room. When Rusk
returned, he turned off the light and sat down on the bed. Pat asked if
she could leave; she told him that she wanted to go home and \"didn\'t
want to come up.\" She said, \"\`Now, \[that\] I came up, can I go?\'\"
Rusk, who was still in possession of her car keys, said he wanted her to
stay.

Rusk then asked Pat to get on the bed with him. He pulled her by the
arms to the bed and began to undress her, removing her blouse and bra.
He unzipped her slacks and she took them off after he told her to do so.
Pat removed the rest of her clothing, and then removed Rusk\'s pants
because \"he asked me to do it.\" After they were both undressed Rusk
started kissing Pat as she was lying on her back. Pat explained what
happened next:

> \"I was still begging him to please let, you know, let me leave. I
> said, \`you can get a lot of other girls down there, for what you
> want,\' and he just kept saying, \`no\'; and then I was really scared,
> because I can\'t describe, you know, what was said. It was more the
> look in his eyes; and I said, at that point --- I didn\'t know what to
> say; and I said, \`If I do what you want, will you let me go without
> killing me?\' **\[ ... \]** Because I didn\'t know, at that point,
> what he was going to do; and I started to cry; and when I did, he put
> his hands on my throat, and started lightly to choke me; and I said,
> \`If I do what you want, will you let me go?\' And he said, yes, and
> at that time, I proceeded to do what he wanted me to.\"

Pat testified that Rusk made her perform oral sex and then vaginal
intercourse.

Immediately after the intercourse, Pat asked if she could leave. She
testified that Rusk said, \"\`Yes,\'\" after which she got up and got
dressed and Rusk returned her car keys. She said that Rusk then \"walked
me to my car, and asked if he could see me again; and I said, \`Yes;\'
and he asked me for my telephone number; and I said, \`No, I\'ll see you
down Fells Point sometime,\' just so I could leave.\" Pat testified that
she \"had no intention of meeting him again.\" She asked him for
directions out of the neighborhood and left.

On her way home, Pat stopped at a gas station, went to the ladies room,
and then drove \"pretty much straight home and pulled up and parked the
car.\" At first she was not going to say anything about the incident.
She explained her initial reaction not to report the incident: \"I
didn\'t want to go through what I\'m going through now \[at the
trial\].\" As she sat in her car reflecting on the incident, Pat said
she began to \"wonder what would happen if I hadn\'t of done what he
wanted me to do. So I thought the right thing to do was to go report it,
and I went from there to Hillendale to find a police car.\" She reported
the incident to the police at about 3:15 a.m. Subsequently, Pat took the
police to Rusk\'s apartment, which she located without any great
difficulty.

Pat\'s girlfriend Terry corroborated her testimony concerning the events
which occurred up to the time that Pat left the bar with Rusk.
Questioned about Pat\'s alcohol consumption, Terry said she was drinking
screwdrivers that night but normally did not finish a drink. Terry
testified about her acquaintanceship with Rusk: \"I knew his face, and
his first name, but I honestly couldn\'t tell you --- apparently I ran
into him sometime before. I couldn\'t tell you how I know him. I don\'t
know him very well at all.\"

**\[ ... \]** Officer Hammett of the Baltimore City Police Department
acknowledged receiving Pat\'s rape complaint at 3:15 a.m. on September
22, 1977. He accompanied her to the 3100 block of Guilford Avenue where
it took Pat several minutes to locate Rusk\'s apartment. Officer Hammett
entered Rusk\'s multi-dwelling apartment house, which contained at least
six apartments, and arrested Rusk in a room on the second floor.

Hammett testified that Pat was sober, and she was taken to City Hospital
for an examination. The examination disclosed that seminal fluid and
spermatazoa were detected in Pat\'s vagina, on her underpants, and on
the bed sheets recovered from Rusk\'s bed.

At the close of the State\'s case-in-chief, Rusk moved for a judgment of
acquittal. In denying the motion, the trial court said:

> \"There is evidence that there is a taking of automobile keys
> forcibly, a request that the prosecuting witness accompany the
> Defendant to the upstairs apartment. She described a look in his eye
> which put her in fear.
>
> \"Now, you are absolutely correct that there was no weapon, no
> physical threatening testified to. However, while she was seated on a
> chair next to the bed, the Defendant excused himself, and came back in
> five minutes; and then she testifies, he pulled her on to the bed by
> reaching over and grabbing her wrists, and/or had her or requested,
> that she disrobe, and assist him in disrobing.
>
> \"Again, she said she was scared, and then she testified to something
> to the effect that she said to him, she was begging him to let her
> leave. She was scared. She started to cry. He started to strangle her
> softly she said. She asked the Defendant, that if she\'d submit, would
> he not kill her, at which point he indicated that he would not; and
> she performed oral sex on him, and then had intercourse.\"

**\[ ... \]** Rusk and two of his friends, Michael Trimp and David
Carroll, testified on his behalf. According to Trimp, they went in
Carroll\'s car to Buggs\' bar to dance, drink and \"tr\[y\] to pick up
some ladies.\" Rusk stayed at the bar, while the others went to get
something to eat.

Trimp and Carroll next saw Rusk walking down the street arm-in-arm with
a lady whom Trimp was unable to identify. Trimp asked Rusk if he needed
a ride home. Rusk responded that the woman he was with was going to
drive him home. Trimp testified that at about 2:00 --- 2:30 a.m. he
returned to the room he rented with Rusk on Guilford Avenue and found
Rusk to be the only person present. Trimp said that as many as twelve
people lived in the entire building and that the room he rented with
Rusk was referred to as their \"pit stop.\" Both Rusk and Trimp actually
resided at places other than the Guilford Avenue room. Trimp testified
that there was a telephone in the apartment.

Carroll\'s testimony corroborated Trimp\'s. He saw Rusk walking down the
street arm-in-arm with a woman. He said \"\[s\]he was kind of like, you
know, snuggling up to him like\.... She was hanging all over him then.\"
Carroll was fairly certain that Pat was the woman who was with Rusk.

Rusk, the 31-year-old defendant, testified that he was in the Buggs
Tavern for about thirty minutes when he noticed Pat standing at the bar.
Rusk said: \"She looked at me, and she smiled. I walked over and said,
hi, and started talking to her.\" He did not remember either knowing or
speaking to Terry. When Pat mentioned that she was about to leave, Rusk
asked her if she wanted to go home with him. In response, Pat said that
she would like to, but could not because she had her car. Rusk then
suggested that they take her car. Pat agreed and they left the bar
arm-in-arm.

Rusk testified that during the drive to her apartment, he discussed with
Pat their similar marital situations and talked about their children. He
said that Pat asked him if he was going to rape her. When he inquired
why she was asking, Pat said that she had been raped once before. Rusk
expressed his sympathy for her. Pat then asked him if he **\[ ... \]**
planned to beat her. He inquired why she was asking and Pat explained
that her husband used to beat her. Rusk again expressed his sympathy. He
testified that at no time did Pat express a fear that she was being
followed by her separated husband.

According to Rusk, when they arrived in front of his apartment Pat
parked the car and turned the engine off. They sat for several minutes
\"petting each other.\" Rusk denied switching off the ignition and
removing the keys. He said that they walked to the apartment house and
proceeded up the stairs to his room. Rusk testified that Pat came
willingly to his room and that at no time did he make threatening facial
expressions. Once inside his room, Rusk left Pat alone for several
minutes while he used the bathroom down the hall. Upon his return, he
switched the light on but immediately turned it off because Pat, who was
seated in the dark in a chair next to the bed, complained it was too
bright. Rusk said that he sat on the bed across from Pat and reached out

> \"and started to put my arms around her, and started kissing her; and
> we fell back into the bed, and she --- we were petting, kissing, and
> she stuck her hand down in my pants and started playing with me; and I
> undid her blouse, and took off her bra; and then I sat up and I said
> \`Let\'s take our clothes off;\' and she said, \`Okay;\' and I took my
> clothes off, and she took her clothes off; and then we proceeded to
> have intercourse.\"

Rusk explained that after the intercourse, Pat \"got uptight.\"

> \"Well, she started to cry. She said that --- she said, \`You guys are
> all alike,\' she says, \`just out for,\' you know, \`one thing.\'
>
> \"She started talking about --- I don\'t know, she was crying and all.
> I tried to calm her down and all; and I said, \`What\'s the matter?\'
> And she said, that she just wanted to leave; and I said, \`Well,
> okay;\' **\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** and she walked out to the car. I walked
> out to the car. She got in the car and left.\"

Rusk denied placing his hands on Pat\'s throat or attempting to strangle
her. He also denied using force or threats of force to get Pat to have
intercourse with him.

In reversing Rusk\'s second degree rape conviction, the Court of Special
Appeals, quoting from *Hazel,* 221 Md. at 469, noted that:

> \"Force is an essential element of the crime \[of rape\] and to
> justify a conviction, the evidence must warrant a conclusion either
> that the victim resisted and her resistance was overcome by force or
> that she was prevented from resisting by threats to her safety.\"

Writing for the majority, Judge Thompson said:

> \"In all of the victim\'s testimony we have been unable to see any
> resistance on her part to the sex acts and certainly can we see no
> fear as would overcome her attempt to resist or escape as required by
> *Hazel.* Possession of the keys by the accused may have deterred her
> vehicular escape but hardly a departure seeking help in the rooming
> house or in the street. We must say that \`the way he looked\' fails
> utterly to support the fear required by *Hazel.*\" 43 Md. App. at 480.

The Court of Special Appeals interpreted *Hazel* as requiring a showing
of a reasonable apprehension of fear in instances where the prosecutrix
did not resist. It concluded:

> \"we find the evidence legally insufficient to warrant a conclusion
> that appellant\'s words or actions created in the mind of the victim a
> reasonable fear that if she resisted, he would have harmed her, or
> that faced with such resistance, he would have used force to overcome
> it. The prosecutrix stated that she was afraid, and submitted because
> of \`the look in his eyes.\' After both were undressed and in the bed,
> and **\[ ... \]**she pleaded to him that she wanted to leave, he
> started to lightly choke her. At oral argument it was brought out that
> the \`lightly choking\' could have been a heavy caress. We do not
> believe that \`lightly choking\' along with all the facts and
> circumstances in the case, were sufficient to cause a reasonable fear
> which overcame her ability to resist. In the absence of any other
> evidence showing force used by appellant, we find that the evidence
> was insufficient to convict appellant of rape.\" *Id.* at 484.

In argument before us on the merits of the case, the parties agreed that
the issue was whether, in light of the principles of *Hazel,* there was
evidence before the jury legally sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the intercourse was \"\[b\]y force or threat of force against
the will and without the consent\" of the victim in violation of Art.
27, § 463 (a) (1). **\[ ... \]**

The vaginal intercourse once being established, the remaining elements
of rape in the second degree under § 463 (a) (1) are, as in a
prosecution for common law rape (1) force --- actual or constructive,
and (2) lack of consent. **\[ ... \]** In this regard, it is well
settled that the terms \"against the will\" and \"without the consent\"
are synonymous in the law of
rape.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xbf44325b68c15ff959cfacd5dad76743bf15e85)

**\[ ... \]**

The vast majority of jurisdictions have required that the victim\'s fear
be reasonably grounded in order to obviate the need for either proof of
actual force on the part of the assailant or physical resistance on the
part of the
victim.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X64035ad39a92f0e2519accdfaf26f26a5e23e36) We
think that, generally, this is the correct standard.

As earlier indicated, the Court of Special Appeals held that a showing
of a reasonable apprehension of fear was essential under *Hazel* to
establish the elements of the offense where the victim did not resist.
The Court did not believe, however, that the evidence was legally
sufficient to demonstrate the existence of \"a reasonable fear\" which
overcame Pat\'s ability to resist. In support of the Court\'s
conclusion, Rusk maintains that the evidence showed that Pat voluntarily
entered his apartment without being subjected to a \"single threat nor a
scintilla of force\"; that she made no effort to run away nor did she
scream for help; that she never exhibited a will to resist; and that her
subjective reaction of fear to the situation in which she had
voluntarily placed herself was unreasonable and exaggerated. Rusk claims
that his acts were not reasonably calculated to overcome a will to
resist; that Pat\'s verbal resistance was not resistance within the
contemplation of *Hazel;* that his alleged menacing look did not
constitute a threat of force; and that even had he pulled Pat to the
bed, and lightly choked her, as she claimed, **\[ ... \]** these
actions, viewed in the context of the entire incident --- no prior
threats having been made --- would be insufficient to constitute force
or a threat of force or render the intercourse nonconsensual.

**\[ ... \]**Applying the constitutional standard of review articulated
in *Jackson v. Virginia, supra, i.e.* --- whether after considering the
evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational
trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime
beyond a reasonable doubt --- it is readily apparent to us that the
trier of fact could rationally find that the elements of force and
non-consent had been established and that Rusk was guilty of the offense
beyond a reasonable doubt. Of course, it was for the jury to observe the
witnesses and their demeanor, and to judge their credibility and weigh
their testimony. Quite obviously, the **\[ ... \]**jury disbelieved Rusk
and believed Pat\'s testimony. From her testimony, the jury could have
reasonably concluded that the taking of her car keys was intended by
Rusk to immobilize her alone, late at night, in a neighborhood with
which she was not familiar; that after Pat had repeatedly refused to
enter his apartment, Rusk commanded in firm tones that she do so; that
Pat was badly frightened and feared that Rusk intended to rape her; that
unable to think clearly and believing that she had no other choice in
the circumstances, Pat entered Rusk\'s apartment; that once inside Pat
asked permission to leave but Rusk told her to stay; that he then pulled
Pat by the arms to the bed and undressed her; that Pat was afraid that
Rusk would kill her unless she submitted; that she began to cry and Rusk
then put his hands on her throat and began \"\`lightly to choke\'\" her;
that Pat asked him if he would let her go without killing her if she
complied with his demands; that Rusk gave an affirmative response, after
which she finally submitted.

Just where persuasion ends and force begins in cases like the present is
essentially a factual issue, to be resolved in light of the controlling
legal precepts. That threats of force need not be made in any particular
manner in order to put a person in fear of bodily harm is well
established. **\[ ... \]**That a victim did not scream out for help or
attempt to escape, while bearing on the question of consent, is
unnecessary where she is restrained by fear of violence. **\[ ... \]**

Considering all of the evidence in the case, with particular focus upon
the actual force applied by Rusk to Pat\'s neck, we conclude that the
jury could rationally find that the essential **\[ ... \]** elements of
second degree rape had been established and that Rusk was guilty of that
offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

*Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed; case remanded to
that court with directions that it affirm the judgment of the Criminal
Court of Baltimore; costs to be paid by the appellee.*

*Cole, J., dissenting:*

**\[ ... \]**

The standard of appellate review in deciding a question of sufficiency,
as the majority correctly notes, is \"whether, after viewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, *any* rational
trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime
beyond a reasonable doubt.\" *Jackson v. Virginia,* 443 U.S. 307, 319,
99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original); *Tichnell
v. State,* 287 Md. 695, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). However, it is equally well
settled that when one of the essential elements of a crime is not
sustained by the evidence, the conviction of the defendant cannot stand
as a matter of law.

The majority, in applying this standard, concludes that \"\[i\]n view of
the evidence adduced at the trial, the reasonableness of Pat\'s
apprehension of fear was plainly a question of fact for the jury to
determine.\" In so concluding, the majority has skipped over the crucial
issue. It seems to me that whether the prosecutrix\'s fear is reasonable
becomes a question only after the court determines that the defendant\'s
conduct under the circumstances was reasonably calculated to give rise
to a fear on her part to the extent that she was unable to resist. In
other words, the fear must stem from his articulable conduct, and
equally, if not more importantly,**\[ ... \]**cannot be inconsistent
with her own contemporaneous reaction to that conduct. The conduct of
the defendant, in and of itself, must clearly indicate force or the
threat of force such as to overpower the prosecutrix\'s ability to
resist or will to resist. In my view, there is no evidence to support
the majority\'s conclusion that the prosecutrix was forced to submit to
sexual intercourse, certainly not fellatio.

**\[ ... \]**

While courts no longer require a female to resist to the utmost or to
resist where resistance would be foolhardy, they do require her
acquiescence in the act of intercourse to stem from fear generated by
something of substance. She may not simply say, \"I was really scared,\"
and thereby transform consent or mere unwillingness into submission by
force. These words do not transform a seducer into a rapist. She must
follow the natural instinct of every proud female to resist, by more
than mere words, the violation of her person by a stranger or an
unwelcomed friend. She must make it plain that she regards such sexual
acts as abhorrent and repugnant to her natural sense of pride. She must
resist unless the defendant has objectively manifested his intent to use
physical force to accomplish his purpose. The law **\[ ... \]** regards
rape as a crime of violence. The majority today attenuates this
proposition. It declares the innocence of an at best distraught young
woman. It does not demonstrate the defendant\'s guilt of the crime of
rape.

My examination of the evidence in a light most favorable to the State
reveals no conduct by the defendant reasonably calculated to cause the
prosecutrix to be so fearful that she should fail to resist and thus,
the element of force is lacking in the State\'s proof.

Here we have a full grown married woman who meets the defendant in a bar
under friendly circumstances. They drink and talk together. She agrees
to give him a ride home in her car. When they arrive at his house,
located in an area with which she was unfamiliar but which was certainly
not isolated, he invites her to come up to his apartment and she
refuses. According to her testimony he takes her keys, walks around to
her side of the car, and says \"Now will you come up?\" She answers,
\"yes.\" The majority suggests that \"from her testimony the jury could
have reasonably concluded that the taking of her keys was intended by
Rusk to immobilize her alone, late at night, in a neighborhood with
which she was unfamiliar\....\" But on what facts does the majority so
conclude? There is no evidence descriptive of the tone of his voice; her
testimony indicates only the bare statement quoted above. How can the
majority extract from this conduct a threat reasonably calculated to
create a fear of imminent bodily harm? There was no weapon, no threat to
inflict physical injury.

She also testified that she was afraid of \"the way he looked,\" and
afraid of his statement, \"come on up, come on up.\" But what can the
majority conclude from this statement coupled with a \"look\" that
remained undescribed? There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that
this was anything other than a pattern of conduct consistent with the
ordinary seduction of a female acquaintance who at first suggests her
disinclination.

After reaching the room she described what occurred as follows:

> **\[ ... \]** I was still begging him to please let, you know, let me
> leave. I said, \"you can get a lot of other girls down there, for what
> you want,\" and he just kept saying, \"no,\" and then I was really
> scared, because I can\'t describe, you know, what was said. It was
> more the look in his eyes; and I said, at that point --- I didn\'t
> know what to say; and I said, \"If I do what you want, will you let me
> go without killing me?\" Because I didn\'t know, at that point, what
> he was going to do; and I started to cry; and when I did, he put his
> hands on my throat and started lightly to choke me; and I said \"If I
> do what you want, will you let me go?\" And he said, yes, and at that
> time, I proceeded to do what he wanted me to.

The majority relies on the trial court\'s statement that the defendant
responded affirmatively to her question \"If I do what you want, will
you let me go without killing me?\" The majority further suggests that
the jury could infer the defendant\'s affirmative response. The facts
belie such inference since by the prosecutrix\'s own testimony the
defendant made *no* response. *He said nothing!*

She then testified that she started to cry and he \"started lightly to
choke\" her, whatever that means. Obviously, the choking was not of any
persuasive significance. During this \"choking\" she was able to talk.
She said \"If I do what you want will you let me go?\" It was at this
point that the defendant said yes.

I find it incredible for the majority to conclude that on these facts,
without more, a woman was *forced* to commit oral sex upon the defendant
and then to engage in vaginal intercourse. In the absence of any verbal
threat to do her grievous bodily harm or the display of any weapon and
threat to use it, I find it difficult to understand how a victim could
participate in these sexual activities and not be willing.

What was the nature and extent of her fear anyhow? She herself testified
she was \"fearful that maybe I had someone following me.\" She was
afraid because she didn\'t know him **\[ ... \]**and she was afraid he
was going to \"rape\" her. But there are no acts or conduct on the part
of the defendant to suggest that these fears were created by the
defendant or that he made any objective, identifiable threats to her
which would give rise to this woman\'s failure to flee, summon help,
scream, or make physical resistance.

As the defendant well knew, this was not a child. This was a married
woman with children, a woman familiar with the social setting in which
these two actors met. It was an ordinary city street, not an isolated
spot. He had not forced his way into her car; he had not taken advantage
of a difference in years or any state of intoxication or mental or
physical incapacity on her part. He did not grapple with her. She got
out of the car, *walked with him* across the street and *followed* him
up the stairs to his room. She certainly had to realize that they were
not going upstairs to play *Scrabble.*

Once in the room she waited while he went to the bathroom where he
stayed for five minutes. In his absence, the room was lighted but she
did not seek a means of escape. She did not even \"try the door\" to
determine if it was locked. She waited.

Upon his return, he turned off the lights and pulled her on the bed.
There is no suggestion or inference to be drawn from her testimony that
he yanked her on the bed or in any manner physically abused her by this
conduct. As a matter of fact there is no suggestion by her that he
bruised or hurt her in any manner, or that the \"choking\" was intended
to be disabling.

He then proceeded to unbutton her blouse and her bra. He did not rip her
clothes off or use any greater force than was necessary to unfasten her
garments. He did not even complete this procedure but requested that she
do it, which she did \"because he asked me to.\" However, she not only
removed her clothing but took his clothes off, too.

Then for a while they lay together on the bed kissing, though she says
she did not return his kisses. However, without protest she then
proceeded to perform oral sex and later submitted to vaginal
intercourse. After these activities **\[ ... \]** were completed, she
asked to leave. They dressed and he walked her to her car and asked to
see her again. She indicated that perhaps they might meet at Fells
Point. He gave her directions home and returned to his apartment where
the police found him later that morning.

The record does not disclose the basis for this young woman\'s
misgivings about her experience with the defendant. The only substantive
fear she had was that she would be late arriving home. The objective
facts make it inherently improbable that the defendant\'s conduct
generated any fear for her physical well-being.

In my judgment the State failed to prove the essential element of force
beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, the judgment of conviction
should be reversed.

Synopsis

Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, Durham County, Anthony M.
Brannon, J., of kidnapping and second-degree rape, and he appealed. The
[Court of Appeals, 61 N.C.App. 454, 300 S.E.2d
857](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1983116016&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)),
found no error. Defendant again appealed. The Supreme Court, Mitchell,
J., held that: (1) evidence failed to establish that defendant had
intent to rape victim at time that he removed her from school grounds,
and (2) though evidence established that, even in absence of physical
resistance by victim, act of sexual intercourse was against her will, it
did not establish element of force necessary to sustain second-degree
rape conviction.

 

Reversed and remanded. 

 

Opinion

MITCHELL, Justice.

The defendant raises on appeal the question whether the evidence of his
guilt of \... second degree rape was sufficient to support his
conviction \.... For reasons discussed herein, we conclude the evidence
was insufficient to support his conviction of \[second degree rape\].

 

The State's evidence tended to show that at the time the incident
occurred the defendant and the prosecuting witness in this case, Cottie
Brown, had been involved for approximately six months in a consensual
sexual relationship. During the six months the two had conflicts at
times and Brown would leave the apartment she shared with the defendant
to stay with her mother. She testified that she would return to the
defendant and the apartment they shared when he called to tell her to
return. Brown \*401 testified that she and the defendant had sexual
relations throughout their relationship. Although she sometimes enjoyed
their sexual relations, she often had sex with the defendant just to
accommodate him. On those occasions, she would stand still and remain
entirely passive while the defendant undressed her and had intercourse
with her.

 

Brown testified that at times their consensual sexual relations involved
some violence. The defendant had struck her several times throughout the
relationship when she refused to give him money or refused to do what he
wanted. Around May 15, 1981, the defendant struck her after asking her
for money that she refused to give him. Brown left the apartment she
shared with the defendant and moved in with her mother. She did not have
intercourse with the defendant after May 15 until the alleged rape on
June 15. After Brown left the defendant, he called her several times and
visited her at Durham Technical Institute where she was enrolled in
classes. When he visited her they talked about their relationship. Brown
testified that she did not tell him she wanted to break off their
relationship because she was afraid he would be angry.

 

On June 15, 1981, Brown arrived at Durham Technical Institute by taxicab
to find the defendant standing close to the school \*\*472 door. The
defendant blocked her path as she walked toward the door and asked her
where she had moved. Brown refused to tell him, and the defendant
grabbed her arm, saying that she was going with him. Brown testified
that it would have taken some effort to pull away. The two walked toward
the parking lot and Brown told the defendant she would walk with him if
he let her go. The defendant then released her. She testified that she
did not run away from him because she was afraid of him. She stated that
other students were nearby.

 

Brown stated that she and the defendant then began a casually paced walk
in the neighborhood around the school. They walked, sometimes side by
side, sometimes with Brown slightly behind the defendant. As they walked
they talked about their relationship. Brown said the defendant did not
hold her or help her along in any way as they walked. The defendant
talked about Brown's "dogging" him and making him seem a fool and about
Brown's mother's interference in the relationship. When the \*402
defendant and Brown left the parking lot, the defendant threatened to
"fix" her face so that her mother could see he was not playing. While
they were walking out of the parking lot, Brown told the defendant she
wanted to go to class. He replied that she was going to miss class that
day.

 

The two continued to walk away from the school. Brown testified that the
defendant continually talked about their relationship as they walked,
but that she paid little attention to what he said because she was
preoccupied with her own thoughts. They passed several people. They
walked along several streets and went down a path close to a wooded area
where they stopped to talk. The defendant asked again where Brown had
moved. She asked him whether he would let her go if she told him her
address. The defendant then asked whether the relationship was over and
Brown told him it was. He then said that since everyone could see her
but him he had a right to make love to her again. Brown said nothing.

 

The two turned around at that point and began walking towards a street
they had walked down previously. Changing directions, they walked \...
side by side with Brown sometimes slightly behind. The defendant did not
hold or touch Brown as they walked. Brown testified that the defendant
did not say where they were going but that, when he said he wanted to
make love, she knew he was going to the house of a friend. She said they
had gone to the house on prior occasions to have sex. The defendant and
Brown passed the same group of men they had passed previously. Brown did
not ask for assistance because some of the men were friends of the
defendant, and she assumed they would not help. The defendant and Brown
continued to walk to the house of one of the defendant's friends,
Lawrence Taylor.

 

When they entered the house, Taylor was inside. Brown sat in the living
room while the defendant and Taylor went to the back of the house and
talked. When asked why she did not try to leave when the defendant and
Taylor were in the back of the house, Brown replied, "It was nowhere to
go. I don't know. I just didn't." The defendant returned to the living
room area and turned on the television. He attempted to fix a broken
fan. Brown asked Taylor for a cigarette, and he gave her one.

 

\*403 The defendant began talking to Brown about another man she had
been seeing. By that time Taylor had gone out of the room and perhaps
the house. The defendant asked if Brown was "ready." The evidence tended
to show that she told him "no, that I wasn't going to bed with him." She
testified that she did not want to have sex with the defendant and did
not consent to do so at any time on June 15.

 

After Brown finished her cigarette, the defendant began kissing her
neck. He pulled her up from the chair in which she had been sitting and
started undressing her. He noticed that she was having her menstrual
period, and she sat down pulling her pants back up. The defendant again
took off her pants and blouse. He told her to \*\*473 lay down on a bed
which was in the living room. She complied and the defendant pushed
apart her legs and had sexual intercourse with her. Brown testified that
she did not try to push him away. She cried during the intercourse.
Afterwards they talked. The defendant told her he wanted to make sure
she was not lying about where she lived and that he would not let her up
unless she told him.

 

After they dressed they talked again about the man Brown had been
seeing. They left the house and went to the defendant's mother's house.
After talking with the defendant's mother, Brown took a bus home. She
talked with her mother about taking out a complaint against the
defendant but did not tell her mother she and the defendant had had sex.
Brown made a complaint to the police the same day.

 

The defendant continued to call Brown after June 15, but she refused to
see him. One evening he called from a telephone booth and told her he
had to talk. When he got to her apartment he threatened to kick her door
down and Brown let him inside. Once inside he said he had intended
merely to talk to her but that he wanted to make love again after seeing
her. Brown said she sat and looked at him, and that he began kissing
her. She pulled away and he picked her up and carried her to the
bedroom. He performed oral sex on her and she testified that she did not
try to fight him off because she found she enjoyed it. The two stayed
together until morning and had sexual intercourse several times that
night. Brown did not disclose the incident to the police immediately
because she said she was embarrassed.

 

\*404 The defendant put on no evidence and moved at the close of the
State's evidence for dismissal of both charges based on insufficiency of
evidence. The trial court denied the motions and the majority in the
Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court.

 

**\[ ... \]**

**\...**

The defendant contends there was no substantial evidence that the sexual
intercourse between Brown and him was by force and against her will. He
argues that the evidence was insufficient to allow the trial court to
submit the issue of his guilt of second degree rape to the jury. After a
review of the evidence, we find this argument to have merit.

 

Second degree rape involves vaginal intercourse with the victim both by
force and against the victim's will. [G.S.
14--27.3](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000037&cite=NCSTS14-27.3&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
Consent by the victim is a complete defense, but consent which is
induced by fear of violence is void and is no legal consent. [State v.
Hall, 293 N.C. 559, 563, 238 S.E.2d 473, 476
(1977)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1977135422&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_476&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_476).

 

\[7\] A defendant can be guilty of raping even his mistress or a "common
strumpet." Cf. [State v. Long, 93 N.C. 542
(1885)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1885014536&pubNum=0000572&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default))
(assault with intent to rape). This is so because consent to sexual
intercourse freely given can be withdrawn at any time prior to
penetration. [State v. Way, 297 N.C. 293, 296, 254 S.E.2d 760, 761
(1979)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1979127288&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_761&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_761).
If the particular act of intercourse for which the defendant is charged
was both by force and against the victim's will, the offense is rape
without regard to the victim's consent given to the defendant for prior
acts of intercourse. Id.; R. Anderson, 1 Wharton's Criminal Law And
Procedure § 302 (1957).

 

Where as here the victim has engaged in a prior continuing consensual
sexual relationship with the defendant, however, determining the
victim's state of mind at the time of the alleged rape obviously is made
more difficult. Although inquiry in such cases still must be made into
the victim's state of mind at the time of the alleged rape, the State
ordinarily will be able to show  \*408 the victim's lack of consent to
the specific act charged only by evidence of statements or actions by
the victim which were clearly communicated to the defendant and which
expressly and unequivocally indicated the victim's withdrawal of any
prior consent and lack of consent to the particular act of intercourse.

 

\[8\] In the present case the State introduced such evidence. It is
true, of course, that Brown gave no physical resistance to the
defendant. Evidence of physical resistance is not necessary to prove
lack of consent in a rape case in this jurisdiction. [State v. Hall, 293
N.C. 559, 563, 238 S.E.2d 473, 476
(1977)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1977135422&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_476&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_476).
Brown testified unequivocally that she did not consent to sexual
intercourse with the defendant on June 15. She was equally unequivocal
in testifying that she submitted to sexual intercourse with the
defendant only because she was afraid of him. During their walk, she
told the defendant that their relationship was at an end. When the
defendant asked her if she was "ready" immediately prior to having
sexual intercourse with her, she told him "no, that I wasn't going to
bed with him." Even in the absence of physical resistance by Brown, such
testimony by her provided substantial evidence that the act of sexual
intercourse was against her will. See, e.g., [State v. Arnold, 284 N.C.
41, 199 S.E.2d 423
(1973)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1973128086&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).

 

\*\*476 \[9\] The State did not offer substantial evidence, however, of
the element of force. As we have stated, actual physical force need not
be shown in order to establish force sufficient to constitute an element
of the crime of rape. Threats of serious bodily harm which reasonably
induce fear thereof are sufficient. See [State v. Burns, 287 N.C. 102,
214 S.E.2d

(1975)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&pubNum=0000708&cite=96SCT288&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
In the present case there was no substantial evidence of either actual
or constructive force.

 

\[10\] The evidence in the present case tended to show that, shortly
after the defendant met Brown at the school, they walked out of the
parking lot with the defendant in front. He stopped and told Brown he
was going to "fix" her face so that her mother could see he was not
"playing." This threat by the defendant and his act of grabbing Brown by
the arm at the school, although they may have induced fear, appeared to
have been unrelated to the act of sexual intercourse between Brown and
the defendant. More important, the record is devoid of evidence that
Brown was in any way intimidated into having sexual intercourse with the
defendant \*409 by that threat or any other act of the defendant on June
15. Brown said she did not pay a lot of attention to what the defendant
said because she was thinking about other things. She specifically
stated that her fear of the defendant was based on an experience with
him prior to June 15 and that on June 15 he did not hold her down or
threaten her with what would happen if she refused to submit to him. The
State failed to offer substantial evidence of force used or threatened
by the defendant on June 15 which related to his desire to have sexual
intercourse on that date and was sufficient to overcome the will of the
victim.

 

We note that the absence of an explicit threat is not determinative in
considering whether there was sufficient force in whatever form to
overcome the will of the victim. It is enough if the totality of the
circumstances gives rise to a reasonable inference that the unspoken
purpose of the threat was to force the victim to submit to unwanted
sexual intercourse. [State v. Barnette, 304 N.C. 447, 284 S.E.2d 298
(1981)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1981150509&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
The evidence introduced in the present case, however, gave rise to no
such inference. Under the peculiar facts of this case, there was no
substantial evidence that threats or force by the defendant on June 15
were sufficiently related to sexual conduct to cause Brown to believe
that she had to submit to sexual intercourse with him or suffer harm.
Although Brown's general fear of the defendant may have been justified
by his conduct on prior occasions, absent evidence that the defendant
used force or threats to overcome the will of the victim to resist the
sexual intercourse alleged to have been rape, such general fear was not
sufficient to show that the defendant used the force required to support
a conviction of rape.

 

In summary, we think that the State's evidence was sufficient to show
that the act of sexual intercourse in question was against Brown's will.
It was not sufficient, however, to show that the act was accomplished by
actual force or by a threat to use force unless she submitted to sexual
intercourse. Since the State did not introduce substantial evidence of
the element of force required to sustain a conviction of rape, the trial
court erred in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the case
against the defendant for second degree rape.

 

For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the opinion of the Court of
Appeals holding that there was no error in the defendant's \*410 trial
for second degree rape and remand this action to the Court of Appeals
for its further remand to the Superior Court, Durham County, for the
entry of directed verdicts in favor of the defendant.

## COMMONWEALTH vs. KENNETH A. APPLEBY.

Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Hampden.

December 3, 1979.\
April 1, 1980.

**\[ ... \]**

## QUIRICO, J.

On November 22, 1978, a Superior Court jury convicted Kenneth A. Appleby
of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, to wit: a riding crop.
G.L.c. 265, § 15A.[^\[1\]^](#Xe32f08e6689183db6110e5a38f9eaf3b432f90b)
The judge sentenced Appleby to eight to ten years in the Massachusetts
Correctional Institution at Walpole. **\[ ... \]**

Kenneth Appleby and Steven Cromer were engaged in a homosexual,
sadomasochistic relationship for over two years, during most of which
period they lived together. Appleby frequently beat Cromer. Appleby\'s
general defense to the indictments was that Cromer had consented to the
beatings, and that he, Appleby, had intended them for Cromer\'s sexual
gratification. **\[ ... \]**

By far the major portion of the Commonwealth\'s case consisted of the
testimony of the alleged victim, Steven Cromer. There follows a summary
of his testimony**\[ ... \]**.

Cromer lived with Appleby during most of the period from June, 1974,
until August 31, 1976 (the date of the incident for which Appleby was
convicted). His entire relationship **\[ ... \]** with Appleby,
including the homosexual acts, was forced upon him; he lived with
Appleby as a \"servant,\" performing household and other duties. Appleby
beat him when he was dissatisfied with Cromer\'s performance of these
duties. Their residence was like a \"military camp,\" with Appleby
owning a variety of weapons and employing them on persons in his
\"torture chamber,\" which Cromer was forced to help design.

In October, 1975, an enraged Appleby beat Cromer badly with a bullwhip
and baseball bat, fracturing his kneecap. Cromer was hospitalized for
this injury until December 4. He received surgery to repair the kneecap,
and he spent several weeks on crutches thereafter.

En route to the hospital, Appleby suggested to Cromer that they tell
hospital personnel that Cromer had had an epileptic seizure and fallen
down some stairs, and Cromer, who had had seizures before, agreed and
maintained the story throughout the hospital stay. They fabricated the
story \"\[t\]o cover things up.\" When he left the hospital, Cromer
returned to Appleby\'s residence in West Springfield, where he resumed
his \"duties\" as best he could.

When asked what distinguished this October, 1975, incident from other
beatings, Cromer stated that it was \"going a little over what I was
used to.\" The October, 1975, incident formed the basis of the first
indictment, on which the jury acquitted Appleby.

A second incident, the subject of the second indictment, allegedly
occurred on February 28, 1976, when Appleby beat Cromer with a bullwhip
because of displeasure with a sandwich Cromer had prepared. A friend of
Appleby was outside at the time, and Appleby called to this person to
bring snow to apply to Cromer\'s wounds. Cromer liked this
\"attention\": \"Other beatings I had, nothing came. No attention was
made to me like that. It was unusual in that respect.\" The jury
acquitted Appleby on this indictment as well.

The third incident occurred on August 31, 1976. Cromer served Appleby
some ice cream which had melted. This enraged **\[ ... \]** Appleby, who
reached for a riding crop with which he hit Cromer. Cromer described the
blow as follows: \"He just connected on the back\.... He was sitting
down\.... \[H\]e just lashed with it like that (Indicates.) And it just
barely connected with my back. There were some thongs at the end and I
just felt them hit me, and he was losing his temper\.... I felt the whip
hit me. A glancing blow.\" Cromer, in his underwear, ran from the house
and to a monastery, where a priest encouraged him to telephone his
relatives. His brother and sister-in-law came to the monastery for him,
and later helped him to remove his personal belongings from Appleby\'s
residence. Cromer never returned to Appleby\'s place thereafter. The
jury convicted Appleby on the indictment involving the riding crop
incident.

Cromer maintained that Appleby was sadistic, but denied that he was
engaged in a sadomasochistic relationship with Appleby. He denied that
he was a homosexual, and he claimed the homosexual acts were forced upon
him from the beginning. He said he could not recall whether violence and
sexual activity with Appleby occurred close in time. Cromer said \"Mr.
Appleby explained later that he delighted in violence to an extent that
he said it was almost sexual or sexual.\"

Cromer acquiesced in this relationship because Appleby \"took me over in
a way\.... He had convinced me that people were constantly following me
and observing my every action and reporting to him.\" Cromer told no one
about the relationship, and sought aid from no one, because Appleby told
him no one would believe him, that he was a \"hippie,\" a \"weirdo,\"
and on drugs. He thought that even the police could not \"stop\"
Appleby. He was under \"duress\" the entire time because he feared that
Appleby would harm him or members of his family if he did not continue
in their relationship.

At one point Cromer stated that he never protested or told Appleby to
stop, because he was afraid to do so. At**\[ ... \]** another point he
stated that he did protest Appleby\'s sadistic activity.

Cromer had a low opinion of himself for having got into the situation,
and he \"lost\" himself in his functions at the Appleby residence. He
said that after the bullwhip incident, \"I felt that I was just a joke
--- that I had taken the beating and had done nothing about it. Just
took the beating, and when he told me to clean up the food off the floor
after that, I did, and Jay Robbins \[Appleby\'s friend\] came in and saw
me on my hands and knees doing this.\"

**\[ ... \]**

Appleby\'s general defense to the three charges was that Cromer had
consented to their sadomasochistic relationship. He admitted that he had
whipped or beaten Cromer almost daily. He denied, however, that the
fractured kneecap was caused by a beating; rather, he asserted the truth
of the story of the epileptic seizure and fall down the stairs. (He also
testified to witnessing a prior seizure and presented medical evidence
of Cromer\'s epilepsy.) As to the second incident, he denied that he
ever beat Cromer severely and said that February 28, 1976, did not stick
out in his mind as involving any incident different from the usual daily
whippings. Regarding the riding crop incident, Appleby testified that
Cromer ran out of the house in his underwear on a rainy night, but said
that this occurred on July 24, **\[ ... \]**1976, after a conversation,
and that there was no beating or whipping of any kind that evening.

Appleby trained attack dogs for a living, and kept whips in his house
for that purpose. He ascribed the initiation of the sadomasochistic
activities entirely to Cromer. He met Cromer while the latter was
\"hustling\" sex for money on a Springfield street. At that time Appleby
was a \"conventional\" homosexual. The first night they met, Cromer
showed him a braided rope he had made from clothesline, and said he
liked to be beaten with that. Appleby refused to engage in beatings.
Cromer beat himself with the clothesline, and Appleby told him not to
use it. In the months before Cromer moved in, their \"regular sexual
ritual\" consisted solely of fellatio and anal intercourse. Cromer told
Appleby that he took drugs, and Appleby saw Cromer injecting himself and
taking pills.

One evening, Cromer asked to go home with Appleby; the latter assented
on the condition that Cromer not bring any drugs. Shortly after they
arrived, Cromer spotted one of the whips Appleby used to train dogs.
Cromer asked Appleby to beat him with the whip, but the latter refused.

The next day, Cromer telephoned Appleby and asked if he could come to
live with him, because some people were following him and trying to kill
him. Appleby told Cromer he had taken too many pills. Shortly
thereafter, Cromer arrived at Appleby\'s home and begged to be let in.
Appleby told him he could move in if he fulfilled four conditions;
Cromer balked at the condition that he give up drugs, but finally
acquiesced, and moved all of his belongings into Appleby\'s home. One of
the other conditions was that there would be no beatings, but within two
weeks Appleby reneged on this condition and agreed to strike Cromer for
the latter\'s sexual
fulfilment.[^\[2\]^](#X960a069e16ff36d57e939273597afb1e975e513) He did
this because Cromer begged for it, and because he, Appleby, had a sexual
reaction to the sexual effect of the beatings on Cromer.

**\[ ... \]** After this, their relationship became a sadomasochistic
one, as well as homosexual, and involved daily beatings of Cromer. At
first, Cromer was able to attain sexual satisfaction with only a few
strokes of a whip, but gradually he began to require more variety.
Together they acquired or constructed leg irons, handcuffs, a torture
rack, several other implements of torture, and a room which Cromer liked
to call the \"torture chamber.\"

When shown the riding crop on direct examination, Appleby denied ever
using it on Cromer. On cross-examination, however, he admitted that the
riding crop \"was employed many times,\" and said that Cromer
\"favored\" the crop, that \"he would be whipped until he reached sexual
orgasm.\" The riding crop never caused \"welts,\" but only \"redness;\"
in fact none of the beatings caused more than \"redness.\" Appleby never
enjoyed whipping Cromer; he enjoyed the sexual effect it had on Cromer
and the fact that Cromer allowed him to have anal intercourse after each
beating. When asked if he intended to strike Cromer, he said, \"I did it
with the intent to turn him on sexually.\"

Appleby had several other sadomasochistic relationships after Cromer
left, and used the implements he had purchased or made for Cromer. All
of the implements, including the riding crop, were found at Appleby\'s
house in 1978.

Appleby presented as part of his case expert testimony of Dr. John Peter
Webster, a minister and psychotherapist. Webster, who had counseled
Appleby after his arrest, also had some knowledge of sadomasochism. We
summarize his testimony. He defined sadomasochism as involving a fusion
of the sexual and aggressive drives, and said the masochist may need to
be \"punished\" in order to release inhibited sexual feelings. He said
that the beatings are generally inseparable from the sexual part of the
relationship, and that typically the masochist needs to feel helpless
and dependent. Cromer\'s staying with Appleby under fear of harm to
himself or his family \"would certainly fit the pattern of masochism.\"

**\[ ... \]**

Assuming that the riding crop incident occurred in relation to sexual
behavior, the question is whether the State can regulate, by the law of
assault and battery, violent behavior which occurs in private,
consensual sexual relationships.

We held in *Commonwealth* v. *Balthazar,* 366 Mass. 298, 302 (1974),
that G.L.c. 272, § 35, prohibiting \"unnatural and lascivious\" acts,
\"must be construed to be inapplicable to private, consensual conduct of
adults. We do so on the ground that the concept of general community
disapproval of specific conduct, which is inherent in § 35, requires
such an interpretation. We do not decide whether a statute which
explicitly prohibits sexual conduct, even if consensual and private,
would be constitutionally infirm.\"

**\[ ... \]**After *Balthazar,* consent is a defense to a charge of
\"unnatural and lascivious\" acts under c. 272, § 35. **\[ ...
\]**Appleby has cited no case, and we are aware of none, extending
protection on either statutory or constitutional grounds beyond the
sexual acts and to accompanying force or violence by means of dangerous
weapons. **\[ ... \]** Any right to sexual privacy that citizens
enjoy**\[ ... \]**[^\[8\]^](#X39429a8067c15810f51ea1264430a03baa03e85)
would be outweighed in the constitutional balancing scheme by the
State\'s interest in preventing violence by the use of dangerous weapons
upon its citizens under the claimed cloak of privacy in sexual
relations. **\[ ... \]**

General Laws c. 265, § 15A, is not aimed at regulating sexual conduct.
Appleby was in no way charged with a crime for committing homosexual
acts. Rather he was tried for violating a statute that implies, as a
matter of public policy, that one may not consent to become a victim of
an assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. ***\[ ... \]***

The fact that violence may be related to sexual activity (or may even
*be* sexual activity to the person inflicting pain on another, as
Appleby testified) does not prevent the State from protecting its
citizens against physical harm. The invalidity of the victim\'s consent
to a battery by means of a dangerous weapon would be the same, however,
whether or not the battery was related to sexual activity. The general
rule is: \"It is settled that to commit a battery upon a person with
such violence that bodily harm is likely to result is unlawful, and
consent thereto is immaterial.\" *Farrell, supra* at
620.[^\[9\]^](#X31ef44b1bf10f3bda45a5a080b97376736964dd) Regardless of
whether sexual activity was involved in the incident in question,
Cromer\'s consent to assault and battery upon him by Appleby by means of
a dangerous weapon cannot absolve Appleby of the crime charged
punishable under G.L.c. 265, § 15A.

**\[ ... \]**

5\. Appleby alleges error in the jury instructions, and in the denial of
his request for instructions that (a) intent to cause sexual
gratification precludes a finding of guilty of the offense charged, and
(b) private, consensual sadomasochistic behavior is an \"absolute
defense to the charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.\"
We have reviewed the judge\'s charge, and find no error. Appleby\'s
requested instructions squarely conflict with our holdings today and
with the holdings of *Farrell, supra.*

For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm Appleby\'s conviction. While we
express some reservation on the severity of the sentence imposed for the
particular assault and battery on August 31, 1976, as established by the
jury verdict, albeit an assault and battery by means of a dangerous
weapon, that subject is not open to review by this tribunal. **\[ ...
\]**

*Judgment affirmed.*

## HENNESSEY, C.J. (concurring).

**\[ ... \]** The only incident which resulted in a guilty verdict was
**\[ ... \]**a blow which \"barely connected\" with the victim\'s back;
it was a \"glancing blow,\" with no evidence of visible injury or after
effects. We may speculate that the sentencing process was perhaps
influenced by the indictments as to two more serious episodes of
violence. However, the jury, by their not guilty verdicts, rejected
those charges, and as a consequence they would have no proper bearing on
the sentence. Perhaps the sentence here was unduly influenced by
knowledge of other charges pending against the defendant at the time of
this trial. Perhaps, also, the sentence was influenced by certain
related circumstances which are abhorrent to most persons, but the
defendant was not charged with those circumstances in any indictment. In
sum, the sentencing result here is one which focuses on the compelling
need for reasoned application of the broad sentencing discretion
ordinarily available to our trial court.

[\[1\]](#X7f57c5cc231f41d643215dd5ae88d3103c78780) The jury acquitted
Appleby on two other indictments charging assault and battery with a
dangerous weapon, to wit: a bat, and assault and battery with a
dangerous weapon, to wit: a whip.

[\[2\]](#X2bbbb89ccb6f2ce5e748bdbac5ac7348add64ec) The two other
conditions were that Cromer (a) attend church every Sunday with Appleby,
and (b) not engage in any \"hustling.\"

Questions re Rusk, Alston & Appleby

 

1\. What are the different potential \-- or actual, based on testimony
\-- narratives in these cases? ie He said/she said, or he said he said?
To be clear, this is not to diminish the victimhood of the harmed
parties in these cases\--all 3 of whom I believe were harmed and did not
consent to certain sexual actions\--but to say how complicated from am
evidentiary perspective sexual assault cases can be and usually are. (ie
no witnesses, varying stories etc)

2\. Each cases involves power differentials, based on gender or other
factors. How should the law attempt to mediate or equalize these,
without diminishing the autonomy of adults to sexual activity and
intimacy of varying kinds (recall Lawrence)?

3\. Relatedly, how does sexual assault law, including the force
requirement, interact with gendered, racialized, and heteronormative
stereotypes about how certain people act?

State of New Jersey in the Interest of M.T.S.

129 N.J. 422 (1992)

609 A.2d 1266

### STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN THE INTEREST OF M.T.S.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey.

Argued January 7, 1992.

Decided July 30, 1992.

\[424\] *Carol M. Henderson,* Deputy Attorney General, argued the cause
for appellant, State of New Jersey (*Robert J. Del Tufo,* Attorney
General of New Jersey, attorney; *Jessica S. Oppenheim,* Deputy Attorney
General, of counsel and on the brief).

*Susan Herman,* Assistant Deputy Public Defender, argued the cause for
respondent M.T.S. (*Wilfredo Caraballo,* Public Defender, attorney).

The opinion of the Court was delivered by HANDLER, J.

Under New Jersey law a person who commits an act of sexual penetration
using physical force or coercion is guilty of second-degree sexual
assault. The sexual assault statute does not define the words \"physical
force.\" The question posed by \[425\] this appeal is whether the
element of \"physical force\" is met simply by an act of non-consensual
penetration involving no more force than necessary to accomplish that
result.

That issue is presented in the context of what is often referred to as
\"acquaintance rape.\" The record in the case discloses that the
juvenile, a seventeen-year-old boy, engaged in consensual kissing and
heavy petting with a fifteen-year-old girl and thereafter engaged in
actual sexual penetration of the girl to which she had not consented.
There was no evidence or suggestion that the juvenile used any unusual
or extra force or threats to accomplish the act of penetration.

The trial court determined that the juvenile was delinquent for
committing a sexual assault. The Appellate Division reversed the
disposition of delinquency, concluding that non-consensual penetration
does not constitute sexual assault unless it is accompanied by some
level of force more than that necessary to accomplish the penetration.

petition for certification. 126 *N.J.* 341, 598 *A.*2d 897 (1991).

## I

The issues in this case are perplexing and controversial. We must
explain the role of force in the contemporary crime of sexual assault
and then define its essential features. We then must consider what
evidence is probative to establish the commission of a sexual assault.
The factual circumstances of this case expose the complexity and
sensitivity of those issues and underscore the analytic difficulty of
those seemingly-straightforward legal questions.

On Monday, May 21, 1990, fifteen-year-old C.G. was living with her
mother, her three siblings, and several other people, including M.T.S.
and his girlfriend. A total of ten people resided in the three-bedroom
town-home at the time of the incident. M.T.S., then age seventeen, was
temporarily residing at the home with the permission of the C.G.\'s
mother; he slept \[426\] downstairs on a couch. C.G. had her own room on
the second floor. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on May 21, C.G. went
upstairs to sleep after having watched television with her mother,
M.T.S., and his girlfriend. When C.G. went to bed, she was wearing
underpants, a bra, shorts, and a shirt. At trial, C.G. and M.T.S.
offered very different accounts concerning the nature of their
relationship and the events that occurred after C.G. had gone upstairs.
The trial court did not credit fully either teenager\'s testimony.

C.G. stated that earlier in the day, M.T.S. had told her three or four
times that he \"was going to make a surprise visit up in \[her\]
bedroom.\" She said that she had not taken M.T.S. seriously and
considered his comments a joke because he frequently teased her. She
testified that M.T.S. had attempted to kiss her on numerous other
occasions and at least once had attempted to put his hands inside of her
pants, but that she had rejected all of his previous advances.

C.G. testified that on May 22, at approximately 1:30 a.m., she awoke to
use the bathroom. As she was getting out of bed, she said, she saw
M.T.S., fully clothed, standing in her doorway. According to C.G.,
M.T.S. then said that \"he was going to tease \[her\] a little bit.\"
C.G. testified that she \"didn\'t think anything of it\"; she walked
past him, used the bathroom, and then returned to bed, falling into a
\"heavy\" sleep within fifteen minutes. The next event C.G. claimed to
recall of that morning was waking up with M.T.S. on top of her, her
underpants and shorts removed. She said \"his penis was into \[her\]
vagina.\" As soon as C.G. realized what had happened, she said, she
immediately slapped M.T.S. once in the face, then \"told him to get off
\[her\], and get out.\" She did not scream or cry out. She testified
that M.T.S. complied in less than one minute after being struck;
according to C.G., \"he jumped right off of \[her\].\" She said she did
not know how long M.T.S. had been inside of her before she awoke.

\[427\] C.G. said that after M.T.S. left the room, she \"fell asleep
crying\" because \"\[she\] couldn\'t believe that he did what he did to
\[her\].\" She explained that she did not immediately tell her mother or
anyone else in the house of the events of that morning because she was
\"scared and in shock.\" According to C.G., M.T.S. engaged in
intercourse with her \"without \[her\] wanting it or telling him to come
up \[to her bedroom\].\" By her own account, C.G. was not otherwise
harmed by M.T.S.

At about 7:00 a.m., C.G. went downstairs and told her mother about her
encounter with M.T.S. earlier in the morning and said that they would
have to \"get \[him\] out of the house.\" While M.T.S. was out on an
errand, C.G.\'s mother gathered his clothes and put them outside in his
car; when he returned, he was told that \"\[he\] better not even get
near the house.\" C.G. and her mother then filed a complaint with the
police.

According to M.T.S., he and C.G. had been good friends for a long time,
and their relationship \"kept leading on to more and more.\" He had been
living at C.G.\'s home for about five days before the incident occurred;
he testified that during the three days preceding the incident they had
been \"kissing and necking\" and had discussed having sexual
intercourse. The first time M.T.S. kissed C.G., he said, she \"didn\'t
want him to, but she did after that.\" He said C.G. repeatedly had
encouraged him to \"make a surprise visit up in her room.\"

M.T.S. testified that at exactly 1:15 a.m. on May 22, he entered C.G.\'s
bedroom as she was walking to the bathroom. He said C.G. soon returned
from the bathroom, and the two began \"kissing and all,\" eventually
moving to the bed. Once they were in bed, he said, they undressed each
other and continued to kiss and touch for about five minutes. M.T.S. and
C.G. proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse. According to M.T.S., who
was on top of C.G., he \"stuck it in\" and \"did it \[thrust\] three
times, and then the fourth time \[he\] stuck it in, that\'s when \[she\]
pulled \[him\] off of her.\" M.T.S. said that as \[428\] C.G. pushed him
off, she said \"stop, get off,\" and he \"hopped off right away.\"

According to M.T.S., after about one minute, he asked C.G. what was
wrong; she replied with a back-hand to his face. He recalled asking C.G.
what was wrong a second time, and her replying, \"how can you take
advantage of me or something like that.\" M.T.S. said that he proceeded
to get dressed and told C.G. to calm down, but that she then told him to
get away from her and began to cry. Before leaving the room, he told
C.G., \"I\'m leaving \... I\'m going with my real girlfriend, don\'t
talk to me \... I don\'t want nothing to do with you or anything, stay
out of my life \... don\'t tell anybody about this \... it would just
screw everything up.\" He then walked downstairs and went to sleep.

On May 23, 1990, M.T.S. was charged with conduct that if engaged in by
an adult would constitute second-degree sexual assault of the victim,
contrary to *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1). In addition, he faced unrelated
charges for third-degree theft of movable property, contrary to
*N.J.S.A.* 2C:20-3a, third-degree escape, contrary to *N.J.S.A.*
2C:29-5, and fourth-degree criminal trespass, contrary to *N.J.S.A.*
2C:18-3.

Following a two-day trial on the sexual assault charge, M.T.S. was
adjudicated delinquent. After reviewing the testimony, the court
concluded that the victim had consented to a session of kissing and
heavy petting with M.T.S. The trial court did not find that C.G. had
been sleeping at the time of penetration, but nevertheless found that
she had not consented to the actual sexual act. Accordingly, the court
concluded that the State had proven second-degree sexual assault beyond
a reasonable doubt. On appeal, following the imposition of suspended
sentences on the sexual assault and the other remaining charges, the
Appellate Division determined that the absence of force beyond that
involved in the act of sexual penetration precluded a finding of
second-degree sexual assault. It therefore reversed \[429\] the
juvenile\'s adjudication of delinquency for that offense. 247 *N.J.
Super.* at 260-61, 588 *A.*2d 1282.

## II

The New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1), defines
\"sexual assault\" as the commission \"of sexual penetration\" \"with
another person\" with the use of \"physical force or
coercion.\"[^\[1\]^](#X6e52986e489b7bb12d565d92b1cc16be0e01356) An
unconstrained reading of the statutory language indicates that both the
act of \"sexual penetration\" and the use of \"physical force or
coercion\" are separate and distinct elements of the offense. *See*
*Medical Soc. v. Department of Law & Pub. Safety,* 120 *N.J.* 18, 26,
575 *A.*2d 1348 (1990) (declaring that no part of a statute should be
considered meaningless or superfluous). Neither the definitions section
of *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1 to -8, nor the remainder of the Code of Criminal
Justice provides assistance in interpreting the words \"physical
force.\" The initial inquiry is, therefore, whether the statutory words
are unambiguous on their face and can be \[430\] understood and applied
in accordance with their plain meaning. The answer to that inquiry is
revealed by the conflicting decisions of the lower courts and the
arguments of the opposing parties. The trial court held that \"physical
force\" had been established by the sexual penetration of the victim
without her consent. The Appellate Division believed that the statute
requires some amount of force more than that necessary to accomplish
penetration.

The parties offer two alternative understandings of the concept of
\"physical force\" as it is used in the statute. The State would read
\"physical force\" to entail any amount of sexual touching brought about
involuntarily. A showing of sexual penetration coupled with a lack of
consent would satisfy the elements of the statute. The Public Defender
urges an interpretation of \"physical force\" to mean force \"used to
overcome lack of consent.\" That definition equates force with violence
and leads to the conclusion that sexual assault requires the application
of some amount of force in addition to the act of penetration.

Current judicial practice suggests an understanding of \"physical
force\" to mean \"any degree of physical power or strength used against
the victim, even though it entails no injury and leaves no mark.\"
*Model Jury Charges, Criminal* 3 (revised Mar. 27, 1989). Resort to
common experience or understanding does not yield a conclusive meaning.
The dictionary provides several definitions of \"force,\" among which
are the following: (1) \"power, violence, compulsion, or constraint
exerted upon or against a person or thing,\" (2) \"a general term for
exercise of strength or power, esp. physical, to overcome resistance,\"
or (3) \"strength or power of any degree that is exercised without
justification or contrary to law upon a person or thing.\" *Webster\'s
Third New International Dictionary* 887 (1961).

Thus, as evidenced by the disagreements among the lower courts and the
parties, and the variety of possible usages, the statutory words
\"physical force\" do not evoke a single \[431\] meaning that is obvious
and plain. Hence, we must pursue avenues of construction in order to
ascertain the meaning of that statutory language. Those avenues are well
charted. When a statute is open to conflicting interpretations, the
court seeks the underlying intent of the legislature, relying on
legislative history and the contemporary context of the statute.
*Monmouth County v. Wissell,* 68 *N.J.* 35, 41-42, 342 *A.*2d 199
(1975). With respect to a law, like the sexual assault statute, that
\"alters or amends the previous law or creates or abolishes types of
actions, it is important, in discovering the legislative intent, to
ascertain the old law, the mischief and the proposed remedy.\" *Grobart
v. Grobart,* 5 *N.J.* 161, 166, 74 *A.*2d 294 (1950); *accord* *Key
Agency v. Continental Casualty Co.,* 31 *N.J.* 98, 155 *A.*2d 547 (1959)
(noting that ambiguous statutory phrases should be interpreted in light
of the occasion and necessity of the law, mischief felt, and remedy in
view). We also remain mindful of the basic tenet of statutory
construction that penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor
of the accused. Nevertheless, the construction must conform to the
intent of the Legislature. *See* *State v. Des Marets,* 92 *N.J.* 62,
68-70, 455 *A.*2d 1074 (1983); *State v. Brown,* 22 *N.J.* 405, 126
*A.*2d 161 (1956).

The provisions proscribing sexual offenses found in the Code of Criminal
Justice, *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1), became effective in 1979, and were
written against almost two hundred years of rape law in New Jersey. The
origin of the rape statute that the current statutory offense of sexual
assault replaced can be traced to the English common law. Under the
common law, rape was defined as \"carnal knowledge of a woman against
her will.\" Cynthia A. Wicktom, Note, *Focusing on the Offender\'s
Forceful Conduct: A Proposal for the Redefinition of Rape Laws,* 56
*Geo.Wash.L.Rev.* 399, 401 (1988) (*Offender\'s Forceful Conduct*).
American jurisdictions generally adopted the English view, but over time
states added the requirement that the carnal knowledge have been
forcible, apparently in order to prove that the act was against the
victim\'s will. *Id.* at 402 \[432\] (citing Rollin Perkins & Ronald
Boyce, *Criminal Law* 211 (3d ed. 1982)). As of 1796, New Jersey
statutory law defined rape as \"carnal knowledge of a woman, forcibly
and against her will.\" Crimes Act of March 18, 1796 § 8, \[1821\]
*N.J.Rev.Laws* (Pennington) 246. Those three elements of rape --- carnal
knowledge, forcibly, and against her will --- remained the essential
elements of the crime until 1979. Leigh Bienen, *Rape III --- National
Developments in Rape Reform Legislation,* 6 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* 170,
207 (1981) (Bienen, *Rape III*).

Under traditional rape law, in order to prove that a rape had occurred,
the state had to show both that force had been used and that the
penetration had been against the woman\'s will. Force was identified and
determined not as an independent factor but in relation to the response
of the victim, which in turn implicated the victim\'s own state of mind.
\"Thus, the perpetrator\'s use of force became criminal only if the
victim\'s state of mind met the statutory requirement. The perpetrator
could use all the force imaginable and no crime would be committed if
the state could not prove additionally that the victim did not
consent.\" National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice,
*Forcible Rape --- An Analysis of Legal Issues* 5 (March 1978)
(*Forcible Rape*). Although the terms \"non-consent\" and \"against her
will\" were often treated as equivalent, see, *e.g.,* *Wilson v. State,*
109 *A.*2d 381 (Del. 1954), *cert. den.,* 348 *U.S.* 983, 75 *S.Ct.*
574, 99 *L.Ed.* 765 (1955), under the traditional definition of rape,
both formulations squarely placed on the victim the burden of proof and
of action. Effectively, a woman who was above the age of consent had
actively and affirmatively to withdraw that consent for the intercourse
to be against her will. As a Delaware court stated, \"If sexual
intercourse is obtained by milder means, or with the consent or silent
submission of the female, it cannot constitute the crime of rape.\"
*State v. Brown,* 83 *A.* 1083, 1084 (O.T. 1912); 75 *C.J.S. Rape* §
11-12 (1952).

The presence or absence of consent often turned on credibility. To
demonstrate that the victim had not consented to the \[433\]
intercourse, and also that sufficient force had been used to accomplish
the rape, the state had to prove that the victim had resisted. According
to the oft-quoted Lord Hale, to be deemed a credible witness, a woman
had to be of good fame, disclose the injury immediately, suffer signs of
injury, and cry out for help. 1 Matthew Hale, *History of the Pleas of
the Crown* 633 (1st ed. 1847). Courts and commentators historically
distrusted the testimony of victims, \"assuming that women lie about
their lack of consent for various reasons: to blackmail men, to explain
the discovery of a consensual affair, or because of psychological
illness.\" *Offender\'s Forceful Conduct, supra,* 56 *Geo. Wash.L.Rev.*
at 403. Evidence of resistance was viewed as a solution to the
credibility problem; it was the \"outward manifestation of nonconsent,
\[a\] device for determining whether a woman actually gave consent.\"
Note, *The Resistance Standard in Rape Legislation,* 18 *Stan.L.Rev.*
680, 689 (1966).

The resistance requirement had a profound effect on the kind of conduct
that could be deemed criminal and on the type of evidence needed to
establish the crime. *See, e.g.,* *State v. Brown,* 127 Wis. 193, 106
*N.W.* 536 (1906) (overturning forcible rape conviction based on
inadequate resistance by the victim); *People v. Dohring,* 59 *N.Y.* 374
(1874). Courts assumed that any woman who was forced to have intercourse
against her will necessarily would resist to the extent of her ability.
*People v. Barnes,* 42 *Cal.*3d 284, 228 *Cal. Rptr.* 228, 721 *P.*2d
110, 117 (1986) (observing that \"\[h\]istorically, it was considered
inconceivable that a woman who truly did not consent to sexual
intercourse would not meet force with force\"). In many jurisdictions
the requirement was that the woman have resisted to the utmost. \"Rape
is not committed unless the woman oppose the man to the utmost limit of
her power.\" *People v. Carey,* 223 *N.Y.* 519, 119 *N.E.* 83 (N.Y.
1918). \"\[A\] mere tactical surrender in the face of an assumed
superior physical force is not enough. Where the penalty for the
defendant may be supreme, so must resistance be unto the uttermost.\"
*Moss v. State,* 208 Miss. 531, 45 *So.*2d 125, 126 (1950). Other states
\[434\] followed a \"reasonableness\" standard, while some required only
sufficient resistance to make non-consent reasonably manifest. *Forcible
Rape, supra,* at 5.

At least by the 1960s courts in New Jersey followed a standard for
establishing resistance that was somewhat less drastic than the
traditional rule. In *State v. Harris,* 70 *N.J. Super.* 9, 174 *A.*2d
645 (1961), the Appellate Division recognized that the \"to the
uttermost\" test was obsolete. *Id.* at 16, 174 *A.*2d 645. \"The fact
that a victim finally submits does not necessarily imply that she
consented. Submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put
in fear, is not consent.\" *Id.* at 16-17, 174 *A.*2d 645. Nonetheless,
the \"resistance\" requirement remained an essential feature of New
Jersey rape law. Thus, in 1965 the Appellate Division stated: \"\[W\]e
have rejected the former test that a woman must resist \`to the
uttermost.\' We only require that she resist as much as she possibly can
under the circumstances.\" *State v. Terry,* 89 *N.J. Super.* 445, 449,
215 *A.*2d 374.

The judicial interpretation of the pre-reform rape law in New Jersey,
with its insistence on resistance by the victim, greatly minimized the
importance of the forcible and assaultive aspect of the defendant\'s
conduct. Rape prosecutions turned then not so much on the forcible or
assaultive character of the defendant\'s actions as on the nature of the
victim\'s response. Note, *Recent Statutory Developments in the
Definition of Forcible Rape,* 61 *Va.L.Rev.* 1500, 1505-07 (1975)
(*Definition of Forcible Rape*). \"\[I\]f a woman assaulted is
physically and mentally able to resist, is not terrified by threats, and
is not in a place and position that resistance would have been useless,
it must be shown that she did, in fact, resist the assault.\" *State v.
Terry, supra,* 89 *N.J. Super.* at 449, 215 *A.*2d 374. Under the
pre-reform law, the resistance offered had to be \"in good faith and
without pretense, with an active determination to prevent the violation
of her person, and must not be merely passive and perfunctory.\" *State
v. Terry, supra,* 89 *N.J. Super.* at 450, 215 *A.*2d 374. That the law
put the rape victim on trial was clear.

\[435\] The resistance requirement had another untoward influence on
traditional rape law. Resistance was necessary not only to prove
non-consent but also to demonstrate that the force used by the defendant
had been sufficient to overcome the victim\'s will. The amount of force
used by the defendant was assessed in relation to the resistance of the
victim. *See, e.g., Tex.Penal Code Ann.* § 21.02 (1974) (repealed 1983)
(stating that \"the amount of force necessary to negate consent is a
relative matter to be judged under all the circumstances, the most
important of which is the resistance of the female\"). In New Jersey the
amount of force necessary to establish rape was characterized as \"\`the
degree of force sufficient to overcome any resistance that had been put
up by the female.\'\" *State v. Terry, supra,* 89 *N.J. Super.* at 451,
215 *A.*2d 374 (quoting jury charge by trial court). Resistance, often
demonstrated by torn clothing and blood, was a sign that the defendant
had used significant force to accomplish the sexual intercourse. Thus,
if the defendant forced himself on a woman, it was her responsibility to
fight back, because force was measured in relation to the resistance she
put forward. Only if she resisted, causing him to use more force than
was necessary to achieve penetration, would his conduct be criminalized.
*See, e.g.,* *Moss v. State, supra,* 45 *So.*2d at 125. Indeed, the
significance of resistance as the proxy for force is illustrated by
cases in which victims were unable to resist; in such cases the force
incident to penetration was deemed sufficient to establish the \"force\"
element of the offense. *E.g.,* *Pomeroy v. State,* 94 *Ind.* 96 (1884);
*State v. Atkins,* 292 *S.W.* 422 (Mo. 1926); *Lee v. State,* 322
*So.*2d 751, 752 (Miss. 1975).

The importance of resistance as an evidentiary requirement set the law
of rape apart from other common-law crimes, particularly in the eyes of
those who advocated reform of rape law in the 1970s. *See, e.g.,* Note,
*The Victim in a Forcible Rape Case: A Feminist View,* 11
*Am.Crim.L.Rev.* 335, 346 (1973). However, the resistance requirement
was not the only special rule applied in the rape context. A host of
evidentiary \[436\] rules and standards of proof distinguished the legal
treatment of rape from the treatment of other crimes. Many jurisdictions
held that a rape conviction could not be sustained if based solely on
the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. *See, e.g.,* *Allison v.
United States,* 409 *F.*2d 445, 448 (D.C. Cir.1969). Often judges added
cautionary instructions to jury charges warning jurors that rape was a
particularly difficult charge to prove. Courts in New Jersey allowed
greater latitude in cross-examining rape victims and in delving into
their backgrounds than in ordinary cases. *State v. Conner,* 97 *N.J.L.*
423, 424, 118 *A.* 211 (Sup.Ct. 1922). Rape victims were required to
make a prompt complaint or have their allegations rejected or viewed
with great skepticism. Some commentators suggested that there be
mandatory psychological testing of rape victims. *E.g.,* 3A *Wigmore on
Evidence* § 924a (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1970).

During the 1970s feminists and others criticized the stereotype that
rape victims were inherently more untrustworthy than other victims of
criminal attack. *See, e.g., House \[of Delegates\] Urges New Definition
of Rape,* 61 *A.B.A.J.* 464 (1975); Note, *Toward a Consent Standard in
the Law of Rape,* 43 *U.Chi.L.Rev.* 613, 638 (1976) (*Toward a Consent
Standard*); *see also* *People v. Barnes, supra,* 721 *P.*2d at 117
(discussing influence of distrust of female rape victims on legal
standards). Reformers condemned such suspicion as discrimination against
victims of rape. *See, e.g., The Legal Bias against Rape Victims,* 61
*A.B.A.J.* 464 (1975). They argued that \"\[d\]istrust of the
complainant\'s credibility \[had\] led to an exaggerated insistence on
evidence of resistance,\" resulting in the victim rather than the
defendant being put on trial. *Toward a Consent Standard, supra* 43
*U.Chi.L.Rev.* at 626. Reformers also challenged the assumption that a
woman would seduce a man and then, in order to protect her virtue, claim
to have been raped. If women are no less trustworthy than other
purported victims of criminal attack, the reformers argued, then women
should face no additional burdens of proving that they had not consented
to or had actively resisted the assault. \[437\] *See* Linda Brookover
Bourque, *Defining Rape* 110 (1989) (declaring objective of reform to
\"bring\[\] legal standards for rape cases in line with those used in
other violent crimes by normalizing requirements for evidence\").

To refute the misguided belief that rape was not real unless the victim
fought back, reformers emphasized empirical research indicating that
women who resisted forcible intercourse often suffered far more serious
injury as a result. Menachem Amir, *Patterns in Forcible Rape,* 164-65,
169-171 (1971); *Definition of Forcible Rape, supra,* 61 *Va.L.Rev.* at
1506; Note, *Elimination of the Resistance Requirement and Other Rape
Law Reforms: The New York Experience,* 47 *Alb.L.Rev.* 871, 872 (1983).
That research discredited the assumption that resistance to the utmost
or to the best of a woman\'s ability was the most reasonable or rational
response to a rape.

The research also helped demonstrate the underlying point of the
reformers that the crime of rape rested not in the overcoming of a
woman\'s will or the insult to her chastity but in the forcible attack
itself --- the assault on her person. Reformers criticized the
conception of rape as a distinctly sexual crime rather than a crime of
violence. They emphasized that rape had its legal origins in laws
designed to protect the property rights of men to their wives and
daughters. Susan Brownmiller, *Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape*
377 (1975); *Acquaintance Rape: The Hidden Crime* 318 (Andrea Parrot &
Laurie Bechhofer, eds. 1991). Although the crime had evolved into an
offense against women, reformers argued that vestiges of the old law
remained, particularly in the understanding of rape as a crime against
the purity or chastity of a woman. *Definition of Forcible Rape, supra,*
61 *Va.L.Rev.* at 1506. The burden of protecting that chastity fell on
the woman, with the state offering its protection only after the woman
demonstrated that she had resisted sufficiently.

That rape under the traditional approach constituted a sexual rather
than an assaultive crime is underscored by the spousal \[438\]
exemption. According to the traditional reasoning, a man could not rape
his wife because consent to sexual intercourse was implied by the
marriage contract. *See, e.g.,* *State v. Smith,* 85 *N.J.* 193, 426
*A.*2d 38 (1981); *see also* Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s
Rts.L.Rep.* at 184, 207 (noting that common-law principles excluded
spouses from prosecution in New Jersey as in most other jurisdictions).
Therefore, sexual intercourse between spouses was lawful regardless of
the force or violence used to accomplish it. *Offender\'s Forceful
Conduct, supra,* 58 *Geo.Wash.L.Rev.* at 402; Note, *To Have and to
Hold: The Marital Rape Exemption and the Fourteenth Amendment,* 99
*Harv.L.Rev.* 1255, 1258-60 (1986); *see also* Hale, *supra,* at 629
(noting that \"a \`ravished\' woman could \`redeem\' the convicted
offender and save him from execution by marrying him\").

Critics of rape law agreed that the focus of the crime should be shifted
from the victim\'s behavior to the defendant\'s conduct, and
particularly to its forceful and assaultive, rather than sexual,
character. Reformers also shared the goals of facilitating rape
prosecutions and of sparing victims much of the degradation involved in
bringing and trying a charge of rape. There were, however, differences
over the best way to redefine the crime. Some reformers advocated a
standard that defined rape as unconsented-to sexual intercourse,
*Towards a Consent Standard, supra,* 43 *U.Chi.L.Rev.* 613; others urged
the elimination of any reference to consent from the definition of rape,
*Offender\'s Forceful Conduct, supra,* 56 *Geo.Wash.L.Rev.* at 401.
Nonetheless, all proponents of reform shared a central premise: that the
burden of showing non-consent should not fall on the victim of the
crime. In dealing with the problem of consent the reform goal was not so
much to purge the entire concept of consent from the law as to eliminate
the burden that had been placed on victims to prove they had not
consented. *Ibid.*

Similarly, with regard to force, rape law reform sought to give
independent significance to the forceful or assaultive conduct of the
defendant and to avoid a definition of force that \[439\] depended on
the reaction of the victim. Traditional interpretations of force were
strongly criticized for failing to acknowledge that force may be
understood simply as the invasion of \"bodily integrity.\" Susan
Estrich, *Rape,* 95 *Yale L.J.* 1087, 1105, (1986). In urging that the
\"resistance\" requirement be abandoned, reformers sought to break the
connection between force and resistance.

## III

The history of traditional rape law sheds clearer light on the factors
that became most influential in the enactment of current law dealing
with sexual offenses. The circumstances surrounding the actual passage
of the current law reveal that it was conceived as a reform measure
reconstituting the law to address a widely-sensed evil and to effectuate
an important public policy. Those circumstances are highly relevant in
understanding legislative intent and in determining the objectives of
the current law.

In October 1971, the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission
promulgated a Final Report and Commentary on its proposed New Jersey
Penal Code. New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, *The New Jersey
Penal Code, Vol. I: Report and Penal Code* (1971). The proposed Code
substantially followed the American Law Institute\'s Model Penal Code
(MPC) with respect to sexual offenses. *See M.P.C.* §§ 213.1 to 213.4.
The proposed provisions did not present a break from traditional rape
law. They would have established two principal sexual offenses:
aggravated rape, a first-degree or second-degree crime involving
egregious circumstances; and rape, a crime of the third-degree. 1971
*Penal Code,* § 2C:14-1(a)(1). Rape was defined as sexual intercourse
with a female to which she was compelled to submit by any threat that
would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution. *Id.* at §
14-1(b)(1). The comments to the MPC, on which the proposed Code was
based, state that \"\[c\]ompulsion plainly implies non-consent,\"
\[440\] and that the words \"compels to submit\" require more than \"a
token initial resistance.\" A.L.I., *MPC,* § 213.1, comments at 306
(revised commentary 1980).

The Legislature did not endorse the Model Penal Code approach to rape.
Rather, it passed a fundamentally different proposal in 1978 when it
adopted the Code of Criminal Justice. *L.* 1978, *c.* 95 § 2C:14-1 to
-7; *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1 to -7. The new statutory provisions covering rape
were formulated by a coalition of feminist groups assisted by the
National Organization of Women (NOW) National Task Force on Rape.
Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* at 207. Both houses
of the Legislature adopted the NOW bill, as it was called, without major
changes and Governor Byrne signed it into law on August 10, 1978. *Id.*
at 207-08. The NOW bill had been modeled after the 1976 Philadelphia
Center for Rape Concern Model Sex Offense Statute. Leigh Bienen, *Rape
II,* 3 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* 90 (1977). The Model Sex Offense Statute in
turn had been based on selected provisions of the Michigan Criminal
Sexual Conduct Statute, *Mich. Stat. Ann.* § 28.788(4)(b) (Callaghan
1990), \[M.C.L.A. § 750.520d\] and on the reform statutes in New Mexico,
Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s
Rts.L.Rep.* at 207. The stated intent of the drafters of the
Philadelphia Center\'s Model Statute had been to remove all features
found to be contrary to the interests of rape victims. John M. Cannel,
*New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated* 279 (1991). According to its
proponents the statute would \"\`normalize the law. We are no longer
saying rape victims are likely to lie. What we are saying is that rape
is just like other violent crimes.\'\" Stuart Marques, *Women\'s
Coalition Lauds Trenton Panel: Tough Rape Law Revisions Advance, Newark
Star Ledger,* (May 10, 1978) at 1 (quoting Roberta Kaufman, New Jersey
Coalition Against Rape).

Since the 1978 reform, the Code has referred to the crime that was once
known as \"rape\" as \"sexual assault.\" The crime now requires
\"penetration,\" not \"sexual intercourse.\" It requires \"force\" or
\"coercion,\" not \"submission\" or \"resistance.\" \[441\] It makes no
reference to the victim\'s state of mind or attitude, or conduct in
response to the assault. It eliminates the spousal exception based on
implied consent. It emphasizes the assaultive character of the offense
by defining sexual penetration to encompass a wide range of sexual
contacts, going well beyond traditional \"carnal
knowledge.\"[^\[2\]^](#X12e481bff9aabf93c3e3841b00e437469b084df)
Consistent with the assaultive character, as opposed to the traditional
sexual character, of the offense, the statute also renders the crime
gender-neutral: both males and females can be actors or victims.

The reform statute defines sexual assault as penetration accomplished by
the use of \"physical force\" or \"coercion,\" but it does not define
either \"physical force\" or \"coercion\" or enumerate examples of
evidence that would establish those elements. Some reformers had argued
that defining \"physical force\" too specifically in the sexual offense
statute might have the effect of limiting force to the enumerated
examples. Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* at 181. The
task of defining \"physical force\" therefore was left to the courts.

That definitional task runs the risk of undermining the basic
legislative intent to reformulate rape law. *See* Susan Estrich, *Real
Rape* 60 (1987) (noting that under many modern formulations of rape
\"\[t\]he prohibition of force or \`forcible compulsion\' ends up being
defined in terms of a woman\'s resistance\"). That risk was encountered
by the Michigan Supreme Court in *People v. Patterson,* 428 *Mich.* 502,
410 *N.W.*2d 733 (1987). That court considered the sufficiency of the
evidence of force or coercion in the prosecution of a sexual contact
charge against a defendant who had placed his hands on the genital area
of a seventeen-year-old girl while she was sleeping. A majority of
\[442\] the court concluded that the defendant had not used force as
required by the statute because there was \"no evidence of physical
overpowering \... \[and\] there was no submission.\" *Id.* 410 *N.W.*2d
at 740. Justice Boyle, in dissent, soundly criticized the majority\'s
position as a distortion of the legislature\'s intent to protect the
sexual privacy of persons from the use of force, coercion, or other
undue advantage. Concluding that the statute did not require a showing
of any extra force, Justice Boyle pointed out that in \"defin\[ing\]
force by measuring the degree of resistance by the victim,\" the
majority had effectively \"reintroduc\[ed\] the resistance requirement,
when the proper focus ought to be on whether the contact was
unpermitted.\" *Id.* at 747-49.

Unlike the Michigan statute interpreted in *Patterson,* the New Jersey
Code of Criminal Justice does not refer to force in relation to
\"overcoming the will\" of the victim, or to the \"physical
overpowering\" of the victim, or the \"submission\" of the victim. It
does not require the demonstrated non-consent of the victim. As we have
noted, in reforming the rape laws, the Legislature placed primary
emphasis on the assaultive nature of the crime, altering its constituent
elements so that they focus exclusively on the forceful or assaultive
conduct of the defendant.

The Legislature\'s concept of sexual assault and the role of force was
significantly colored by its understanding of the law of assault and
battery. As a general matter, criminal battery is defined as \"the
unlawful application of force to the person of another.\" 2 Wayne LaFave
& Austin Scott, *Criminal Law,* § 7.15 at 301 (1986). The application of
force is criminal when it results in either (a) a physical injury or (b)
an offensive touching. *Id.* at 301-02. Any \"unauthorized touching of
another \[is\] a battery.\" *Perna v. Pirozzi,* 92 *N.J.* 446, 462, 457
*A.*2d 431 (1983). Thus, by eliminating all references to the victim\'s
state of mind and conduct, and by broadening the definition of
penetration to cover not only sexual intercourse \[443\] between a man
and a woman but a range of acts that invade another\'s body or compel
intimate contact, the Legislature emphasized the affinity between sexual
assault and other forms of assault and battery.

The intent of the Legislature to redefine rape consistent with the law
of assault and battery is further evidenced by the legislative treatment
of other sexual crimes less serious than and derivative of traditional
rape. The Code redefined the offense of criminal sexual contact to
emphasize the involuntary and personally-offensive nature of the
touching. *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1(d). Sexual contact is criminal under the
same circumstances that render an act of sexual penetration a sexual
assault, namely, when \"physical force\" or \"coercion\" demonstrates
that it is unauthorized and offensive. *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-3(b). Thus, just
as any unauthorized touching is a crime under traditional laws of
assault and battery, so is any unauthorized sexual contact a crime under
the reformed law of criminal sexual contact, and so is any unauthorized
sexual penetration a crime under the reformed law of sexual assault.

The understanding of sexual assault as a criminal battery, albeit one
with especially serious consequences, follows necessarily from the
Legislature\'s decision to eliminate non-consent and resistance from the
substantive definition of the offense. Under the new law, the victim no
longer is required to resist and therefore need not have said or done
anything in order for the sexual penetration to be unlawful. The alleged
victim is not put on trial, and his or her responsive or defensive
behavior is rendered immaterial. We are thus satisfied that an
interpretation of the statutory crime of sexual assault to require
physical force in addition to that entailed in an act of involuntary or
unwanted sexual penetration would be fundamentally inconsistent with the
legislative purpose to eliminate any consideration of whether the victim
resisted or expressed non-consent.

\[444\] We note that the contrary interpretation of force --- that the
element of force need be extrinsic to the sexual act --- would not only
reintroduce a resistance requirement into the sexual assault law, but
also would immunize many acts of criminal sexual *contact* short of
penetration. The characteristics that make a sexual contact unlawful are
the same as those that make a sexual penetration unlawful. An actor is
guilty of criminal sexual contact if he or she commits an act of sexual
contact with another using \"physical force\" or \"coercion.\"
*N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-3(b). That the Legislature would have wanted to
decriminalize unauthorized sexual intrusions on the bodily integrity of
a victim by requiring a showing of force in addition to that entailed in
the sexual contact itself is hardly possible.

Because the statute eschews any reference to the victim\'s will or
resistance, the standard defining the role of force in sexual
penetration must prevent the possibility that the establishment of the
crime will turn on the alleged victim\'s state of mind or responsive
behavior. We conclude, therefore, that any act of sexual penetration
engaged in by the defendant without the affirmative and freely-given
permission of the victim to the specific act of penetration constitutes
the offense of sexual assault. Therefore, physical force in excess of
that inherent in the act of sexual penetration is not required for such
penetration to be unlawful. The definition of \"physical force\" is
satisfied under *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1) if the defendant applies any
amount of force against another person in the absence of what a
reasonable person would believe to be affirmative and freely-given
permission to the act of sexual penetration.

Under the reformed statute, permission to engage in sexual penetration
must be affirmative and it must be given freely, but that permission may
be inferred either from acts or statements reasonably viewed in light of
the surrounding circumstances. *See Ill. Rev. Stat. ch.* 38, para. 12-17
(1984) (defining consent as \"freely given agreement\"); *see also,*
*People v.* \[445\] *Patterson, supra,* 410 *N.W.*2d at 749 (Boyle, J.,
dissenting) (reasoning that \"force\" may include \"a sexual touching
brought about involuntarily,\" and may consist of \"a contact which
occurs before consent can be given or refused\"); *cf. N.J.S.A.*
2C:2-10(c)(3) (indicating that \"consent\" does not constitute a defense
sufficient to negate an element of a crime if consent was induced or
accomplished by force or coercion). Persons need not, of course,
expressly announce their consent to engage in intercourse for there to
be affirmative permission. Permission to engage in an act of sexual
penetration can be and indeed often is indicated through physical
actions rather than words. Permission is demonstrated when the evidence,
in whatever form, is sufficient to demonstrate that a reasonable person
would have believed that the alleged victim had affirmatively and freely
given authorization to the act.

Our understanding of the meaning and application of \"physical force\"
under the sexual assault statute indicates that the term\'s inclusion
was neither inadvertent nor redundant. The term \"physical force,\" like
its companion term \"coercion,\" acts to qualify the nature and
character of the \"sexual penetration.\" Sexual penetration accomplished
through the use of force is unauthorized sexual penetration. That
functional understanding of \"physical force\" encompasses the notion of
\"unpermitted touching\" derived from the Legislature\'s decision to
redefine rape as a sexual assault. As already noted, under assault and
battery doctrine, any amount of force that results in either physical
injury or offensive touching is sufficient to establish a battery.
Hence, as a description of the method of achieving \"sexual
penetration,\" the term \"physical force\" serves to define and explain
the acts that are offensive, unauthorized, and unlawful.

That understanding of the crime of sexual assault fully comports with
the public policy sought to be effectuated by the Legislature. In
redefining rape law as sexual assault, the Legislature adopted the
concept of sexual assault as a crime against the bodily integrity of the
victim. Although it is \[446\] possible to imagine a set of rules in
which persons must demonstrate affirmatively that sexual contact is
unwanted or not permitted, such a regime would be inconsistent with
modern principles of personal autonomy. The Legislature recast the law
of rape as sexual assault to bring that area of law in line with the
expectation of privacy and bodily control that long has characterized
most of our private and public law. *See* *Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle
Paint Oil Co.,* 129 *N.J.* 81, 94-96, 609 *A.*2d 11 (1992) (recognizing
importance of constitutional and common-law protection of personal
privacy); *id.* at 106, 609 *A.*2d 11 (Pollock, J., concurring)
(emphasizing that common-law right of privacy protects individual
self-determination and autonomy). In interpreting \"physical force\" to
include any touching that occurs without permission we seek to respect
that goal.

Today the law of sexual assault is indispensable to the system of legal
rules that assures each of us the right to decide who may touch our
bodies, when, and under what circumstances. The decision to engage in
sexual relations with another person is one of the most private and
intimate decisions a person can make. Each person has the right not only
to decide whether to engage in sexual contact with another, but also to
control the circumstances and character of that contact. No one, neither
a spouse, nor a friend, nor an acquaintance, nor a stranger, has the
right or the privilege to force sexual contact. *See Definition of
Forcible Rape, supra,* 61 *Va.L.Rev.* at 1529 (arguing that \"forcible
rape is viewed as a heinous crime primarily because it is a violent
assault on a person\'s bodily security, particularly degrading because
that person is forced to submit to an act of the most intimate
nature\").

We emphasize as well that what is now referred to as \"acquaintance
rape\" is not a new phenomenon. Nor was it a \"futuristic\" concept in
1978 when the sexual assault law was enacted. Current concern over the
prevalence of forced sexual intercourse between persons who know one
another reflects both greater awareness of the extent of such behavior
and a growing appreciation of its gravity. Notwithstanding the \[447\]
stereotype of rape as a violent attack by a stranger, the vast majority
of sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone known to the victim.
*Acquaintance Rape, supra,* at 10. One respected study indicates that
more than half of all rapes are committed by male relatives, current or
former husbands, boyfriends or lovers. Diana Russell, *The Prevalence
and Incidence of Forcible Rape and Attempted Rape of Females,* 7
*Victimology* 81 (1982). Similarly, contrary to common myths,
perpetrators generally do not use guns or knives and victims generally
do not suffer external bruises or cuts. *Acquaintance Rape, supra,* at
10. Although this more realistic and accurate view of rape only recently
has achieved widespread public circulation, it was a central concern of
the proponents of reform in the 1970s. *Id.* at 18.

The insight into rape as an assaultive crime is consistent with our
evolving understanding of the wrong inherent in forced sexual intimacy.
It is one that was appreciated by the Legislature when it reformed the
rape laws, reflecting an emerging awareness that the definition of rape
should correspond fully with the experiences and perspectives of rape
victims. Although reformers focused primarily on the problems associated
with convicting defendants accused of violent rape, the recognition that
forced sexual intercourse often takes place between persons who know
each other and often involves little or no violence comports with the
understanding of the sexual assault law that was embraced by the
Legislature. Any other interpretation of the law, particularly one that
defined force in relation to the resistance or protest of the victim,
would directly undermine the goals sought to be achieved by its reform.

## IV

In a case such as this one, in which the State does not allege violence
or force extrinsic to the act of penetration, the factfinder must decide
whether the defendant\'s act of penetration was undertaken in
circumstances that led the defendant reasonably \[448\] to believe that
the alleged victim had freely given affirmative permission to the
specific act of sexual penetration. Such permission can be indicated
either through words or through actions that, when viewed in the light
of all the surrounding circumstances, would demonstrate to a reasonable
person affirmative and freely-given authorization for the specific act
of sexual penetration.

In applying that standard to the facts in these cases, the focus of
attention must be on the nature of the defendant\'s actions. The role of
the factfinder is not to decide whether reasonable people may engage in
acts of penetration without the permission of others. The Legislature
answered that question when it enacted the reformed sexual assault
statute: reasonable people do not engage in acts of penetration without
permission, and it is unlawful to do so. The role of the factfinder is
to decide not whether engaging in an act of penetration without
permission of another person is reasonable, but only whether the
defendant\'s belief that the alleged victim had freely given affirmative
permission was reasonable.

In these cases neither the alleged victim\'s subjective state of mind
nor the reasonableness of the alleged victim\'s actions can be deemed
relevant to the offense. The alleged victim may be questioned about what
he or she did or said only to determine whether the defendant was
reasonable in believing that affirmative permission had been freely
given. To repeat, the law places no burden on the alleged victim to have
expressed non-consent or to have denied permission, and no inquiry is
made into what he or she thought or desired or why he or she did not
resist or protest.

In short, in order to convict under the sexual assault statute in cases
such as these, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there
was sexual penetration and that it was accomplished without the
affirmative and freely-given permission of the alleged victim. As we
have indicated, such proof can be based on evidence of conduct or words
in light of \[449\] surrounding circumstances and must demonstrate
beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would not have
believed that there was affirmative and freely-given permission. If
there is evidence to suggest that the defendant reasonably believed that
such permission had been given, the State must demonstrate either that
defendant did not actually believe that affirmative permission had been
freely-given or that such a belief was unreasonable under all of the
circumstances. Thus, the State bears the burden of proof throughout the
case.

In the context of a sexual penetration not involving unusual or added
\"physical force,\" the inclusion of \"permission\" as an aspect of
\"physical force\" effectively subsumes and obviates any defense based
on consent. *See N.J.S.A.* 2C:2-10c(3). The definition of \"permission\"
serves to define the \"consent\" that otherwise might allow a defendant
to avoid criminal liability. Because \"physical force\" as an element of
sexual assault in this context requires the *absence* of affirmative and
freely-given permission, the \"consent\" necessary to negate such
\"physical force\" under a defense based on consent would require the
*presence* of such affirmative and freely-given permission. Any lesser
form of consent would render the sexual penetration unlawful and cannot
constitute a defense.

In this case, the Appellate Division concluded that non-consensual
penetration accomplished with no additional physical force or coercion
is not criminalized under the sexual assault statute. 247 *N.J. Super.*
at 260, 588 *A.*2d 1282. It acknowledged that its conclusion was
\"anomalous\" because it recognized that \"a woman has every right to
end \[physically intimate\] activity without sexual penetration.\"
*Ibid.* Thus, it added to its holding that \"\[e\]ven the force of
penetration might\... be sufficient if it is shown to be employed to
overcome the victim\'s unequivocal expressed desire to limit the
encounter.\" *Ibid.*

The Appellate Division was correct in recognizing that a woman\'s right
to end intimate activity without penetration is a \[450\] protectable
right the violation of which can be a criminal offense. However, it
misperceived the purpose of the statute in believing that the only way
that right can be protected is by the woman\'s unequivocally-expressed
desire to end the activity. The effect of that requirement would be to
import into the sexual assault statute the notion that an assault occurs
only if the victim\'s will is overcome, and thus to reintroduce the
requirement of non-consent and victim-resistance as a constituent
material element of the crime. Under the reformed statute, a person\'s
failure to protest or resist cannot be considered or used as
justification for bodily invasion.

We acknowledge that cases such as this are inherently fact sensitive and
depend on the reasoned judgment and common sense of judges and juries.
The trial court concluded that the victim had not expressed consent to
the act of intercourse, either through her words or actions. We conclude
that the record provides reasonable support for the trial court\'s
disposition.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and
reinstate the disposition of juvenile delinquency for the commission of
second-degree sexual assault.

BECK, J.:

This case prompts our consideration of the law with respect to forcible
compulsion and consent in sexual assault cases. After a careful review
of the record and an in-depth analysis of the issue at hand, we affirm.

Appellant, an eighteen year-old college freshman, was charged with
involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (IDSI), aggravated indecent
assault and related offenses in connection with an incident that
occurred in a Lafayette College campus dormitory. The victim was another
freshman student appellant met at school.

At trial, both the victim and appellant testified that a couple of hours
prior to the incident at issue, the two went to appellant's dorm room
and engaged in intimate contact. The victim testified that the couple's
conduct was limited to kissing and fondling. Appellant, on the other
hand, testified that during this initial encounter, he and the victim
engaged in "rough sex" which culminated in the victim performing
fellatio on him. According to appellant, the victim acted aggressively
at this first rendezvous by holding appellant's arms above his head,
biting his chest, stating "You know you want me," and initiating oral
sex.

After the encounter, the students separated and went to the dining hall
with their respective friends. They met up again later and once more
found themselves in appellant's dorm room. While their accounts of what
occurred at the first meeting contained significant differences, their
versions of events at the second meeting were grossly divergent. The
victim testified that appellant locked the door, pushed her onto the
bed, straddled her, held her wrists above her head and forced his penis
into her mouth. She struggled with appellant throughout the entire
encounter and warned him that "someone would look for her" and "someone
would find out." She also told him that she was scheduled to be at a
mandatory seminar and repeatedly stated that she did not want to engage
in sex, but her pleas went unheeded.

According to the victim, appellant forced his hands inside a hole in her
jeans and penetrated her with his fingers. He then placed his penis
inside the torn jeans, removed it and ejaculated on her face, hair and
sweater. Thereafter, he turned her over onto her stomach, pulled down
her underpants and attempted to penetrate her anally. Throughout the
incident, appellant made various statements to the victim, including "I
know you want it," "I know you want my dick in your mouth" and "Nobody
will know where you are." When the victim attempted to leave, appellant
blocked her path. Only after striking him in the groin with her knee was
the victim able to escape.

Appellant characterized the second meeting in a far different light. He
stated that as he led the victim into his room, she told him it would
have to be "a quick one." As a result, appellant figured that their
sexual liaison would be brief. Thereafter, according to appellant, he
began to engage in the same type of behavior the victim had exhibited in
their previous encounter. Appellant admitted that he held the young
woman's arms above her head, straddled her and placed his penis at her
mouth. He testified that at that point he told her "I know you want my
dick in your mouth." When she replied "no," appellant answered "No means
yes." After another verbal exchange that included the victim's statement
that she had to leave, appellant again insisted that "she wanted it."
This time she answered "No, I honestly don't." Upon hearing this,
appellant no longer sought to engage in oral sex and removed himself
from her body. However, as the two lay side by side on the bed, they
continued to kiss and fondle one another.

Appellant admitted to touching the victim's genitalia and to placing his
penis inside the hole in her jeans. According to appellant, the victim
enjoyed the contact and responded positively to his actions. At some
point, however, she stood up and informed appellant that she had to
leave. When appellant again attempted to touch her, this time on the
thigh, she told him she was "getting pissed." Before appellant could
"rearrange himself," so that he could walk the victim to her class, she
abruptly left the room.

At trial, both sides presented evidence to support their positions.
Appellant's college friends testified that after the first encounter,
but before the second, appellant showed them bite marks on his chest
that he had received from the victim during the first encounter.
Numerous character witnesses testified on appellant's behalf.

The Commonwealth offered physical evidence of sperm found on the
victim's sweater. Medical personnel testified to treating the victim on
the night in question. Many of the victim's friends and classmates
described her as nervous, shaken and upset after the incident.

Defense counsel argued throughout the trial and in closing that
appellant, relying on his previous encounter with the victim, did not
believe his actions were taken without her consent. Presenting appellant
as sexually inexperienced, counsel argued that his client believed the
victim was a willing participant during their intimate encounters. In
light of his limited experience and the victim's initially. aggressive
behavior, argued counsel, appellant's beliefs were reasonable. Further,
the victim's conduct throughout the second encounter, as testified to by
appellant, would not make appellant's actions "forcible" since it
appeared that the victim was enjoying the encounter. Finally, as soon as
appellant realized that the victim truly did not wish to engage in oral
sex a second time, appellant stopped seeking same. As a result,
appellant's actions could not be deemed forcible compulsion.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty on virtually all counts.[^102]
Appellant was sentenced to two to five years in prison. On direct
appeal, he retained new counsel who has raised a single issue of
ineffectiveness before this court. He argues that trial counsel provided
ineffective assistance in failing to request a jury charge on the
defense of mistake of fact. Specifically, appellant claims that counsel
should have asked the court to instruct the jurors that if they found
appellant reasonably, though mistakenly, believed that the victim was
consenting to his sexual advances, they could find him not guilty.

**\[ ... \]**

Counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a baseless
claim. **\[ ... \]**Further, the quality of counsel's stewardship is
based on the state of the law as it existed at time of trial; counsel is
not ineffective if he fails to predict future developments or changes in
the law. **\[ ... \]**

The Commonwealth relies on **\[ ... \]**

an opinion by a panel of this court. *Commonwealth v. Williams,* 294
Pa.Super. 93, 439 A.2d 765 (Pa.Super.1982), concerned the rape and
assault of a Temple University student. The facts established that the
victim accepted a ride from the appellant on a snowy evening in
Philadelphia. Instead of taking the young woman to the bus station,
appellant drove her to a dark area, threatened to kill her and informed
her that he wanted sex. The victim told Williams to "go ahead" because
she did not wish to be hurt.

After his conviction and sentence, appellant filed a direct appeal and
argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in refusing to
instruct the jury "that if the defendant reasonably believed that the
pros-ecutrix had consented to his sexual advances that this would
constitute a defense to the rape and involuntary deviate sexual
intercourse charge."

**\[ ... \]**This court rejected Williams's claim and held:

> **\[ ... \]**The charge requested by the defendant is not now and has
> never been the law of Pennsylvania. When one individual uses force or
> the threat of force to have sexual relations with a person not his
> spouse and without the person's consent he has committed the crime of
> rape. *If the element of the defendant's belief as to the victim's
> state of mind is to be established as a defense to the crime of rape
> then it should be done by our legislature which has the power to
> define crimes and offenses. We refuse to create such a defense.*

**\[ ... \]**

In response, appellant makes two arguments. First, he argues that the
"stranger rape" facts of *Williams* were far different from those of
this case, making the case inapplicable. Second, he maintains that the
law with respect to rape and sexual assault has changed significantly
over the last decade, along with our understanding of the crime and its
permutations, making a mistake of fact instruction in a date rape case a
necessity for a fair trial.

**\[ ... \]**

The issues of consent and forcible compulsion raised in sexual assault
prosecutions have always been complex. Unless the incident is witnessed
by a third party, or is accompanied by conspicuous injury, a rape case
is often reduced to a credibility battle between the complainant and the
defendant. Our laws have sought continually to protect victims of sexual
assault, and in the process, have undergone significant change. Although
the rape and IDSI laws have always required the element of "forcible
compulsion," that. term was not initially defined. **\[ ... \]**

Indeed, it was not until the supreme court's decision in *Commonwealth
v. Berkowitz,* 537 Pa. 143, 641 A.2d 1161 (1994), that the legislature
amended the law with respect to sexual assaults.[^103] *Berkowitz,* like
the case before us, involved an incident between two young college
students in a dormitory room. The complainant testified that she entered
the appellant's room hoping to find his roommate. She stayed in the room
at the appellant's request. At some point, the appellant moved toward
the complainant, touched her breasts and attempted to put his penis in
her mouth. He then removed her pants and undergarments and penetrated
her vagina with his penis. Throughout the encounter, the complainant
repeatedly told the appellant "no," but she made no attempt to leave
even though she could have done so as the appellant was not restraining
her in any manner.

Our supreme court considered the facts set out above and concluded that
the element of forcible compulsion was not established. While
recognizing that the complainant said "no" throughout the incident, the
court stated that the legislature intended the term forcible compulsion
to mean "something more than a lack of consent." **\[ ...
\]**Berkowitz's rape conviction was reversed.

Less than one year after the *Berkowitz* decision, the legislature
amended the sexual assault law by adding a definition for forcible
compulsion. **\[ ... \]**

> "Forcible Compulsion." Compulsion by use of physical, intellectual,
> moral, emotional or psychological force, either express or implied.
> **\[ ... \]**

It is this broader definition, argues appellant in this case, that
prompts the necessity for a mistake of fact jury instruction in cases
where such a defense is raised. According to appellant:

> The language of the present statute inextricably links the issues of
> consent with *mens rea.* To ask a jury to consider whether the
> defendant used "intellectual or moral" force, while denying the
> instruction as to how to consider the defendant's mental state at the
> time of alleged encounter is patently unfair to the accused.

**\[ ... \]**

Appellant's argument is bolstered by the fact that the concept of
"mistake of fact" has long been a fixture in the criminal law. The
concept is codified in Pennsylvania and provides:

> Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact, for which there is
> reasonable explanation or excuse, is a defense if:
>
> \(1\) the ignorance or mistake negatives the intent, knowledge,
> belief, recklessness, or negligence required to establish a material
> element of the offense; or
>
> \(2\) the law provides that the state of mind established by such
> ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 304.

The notion that one charged with sexual assault may defend by claiming a
reasonable belief of consent has been recognized in other jurisdictions.
The New Jersey Supreme Court has stated:

> If there is evidence to suggest that the defendant reasonably believed
> that \... permission had been given, the State must demonstrate either
> that the defendant did not actually believe that affirmative
> permission had been freely-given or that such belief was unreasonable
> under all of the circumstances.

*In the Interest of M.T.S.,* 129 N.J. 422, 609 A.2d 1266, 1279
(N.J.1992).

Courts in other jurisdictions have likewise held that jury instructions
regarding the defendant's reasonable belief as to consent are proper.
**\[ ... \]**

Although the logic of these other cases is persuasive, we are unable to
adopt the principles enunciated in them because of the binding precedent
with which we are faced, namely, *Williams.* In an effort to avoid
application of *Williams,* appellant directs our attention to the
Subcommittee Notes of the Pennsylvania Criminal Suggested Standard Jury
Instructions. The possible conflict between *Williams* and § 304
(Mistake of Fact) was not lost on the Subcommittee.

> **\[ ... \]**In the Subcommittee's opinion, the courts should
> recognize as a defense a defendant's non-reeklessly held, mistaken
> belief regarding consent. The jury ought to be told in what
> circumstances a mistaken belief may preclude a defendant's forceful
> conduct from being forcible compulsion or threat of forcible
> compulsion.

**\[ ... \]**

> In the opinion of the Subcommittee there may be cases, especially now
> that *Rhodes* has extended the definition of force to psychological,
> moral and intellectual force, where a defendant might non-recklessly
> or even reasonably, but wrongly, believe that his words and conduct do
> not constitute force or the threat of force and that a non-resisting
> female is consenting. An example might be "date rape" resulting from
> mutual misunderstanding. The boy does not intend or suspect the
> intimidating potential of his vigorous wooing. The girl, misjudging
> the boys' character, believes he will become violent if thwarted; she
> feigns willingness, even some pleasure. In our opinion the defendant
> in such a case ought not to be convicted of rape.

**\[ ... \]**

It is clear that the Subcommittee gave extensive thought to the
ever-changing law of sexual assault and our understanding of sexual
behavior in modern times. We agree **\[ ... \]**that the rule in
*Williams* is inappropriate in the type of date rape case described
above. Changing codes of sexual conduct, particularly those exhibited on
college campuses, may require that we give greater weight to what is
occurring beneath the overt actions of young men and women. Recognition
of those changes, in the form of specified jury instructions, strikes us
an appropriate course of action.

**\[ ... \]**As is obvious from our discussion above, the changes in the
statute are significant and have served to extend culpability in rape
and IDSI eases to a variety of new circumstances, including incidents
involving psychological, moral and intellectual force.

**\[ ... \]**

We are keenly aware of the differences between *Williams* and this case.
Most notable is the fact that Williams and his victim never met before
the incident in question. Here, appellant and the victim not only knew
one another, but had engaged in intimate contact just hours before the
incident in question. It is clear however, that the *Williams* court's
basis for denying the jury instruction was its conclusion that the law
did not require it and, further, that the judiciary had no authority to
grant it. Even if we were to disagree with those conclusions, we are
powerless to alter them.

In any event, distinguishing *Williams* on the basis of the parties'
previous contacts, and therefore holding that it should not apply here,
is not enough to allow appellant the relief he seeks. Even if we decide
that we are persuaded by appellant's arguments chronicling the history
of sexual assault law and the Jury Instructions Subcommittee's views, we
face a second barrier. Because this appeal raises ineffective assistance
of counsel, we are-required to find that appellant's trial lawyer made a
mistake. That mistake is the failure to ask the trial court for an
instruction that the *Williams* case held is unwarranted. In other
words, we would have to find that counsel's failure to argue for a
change in the law constituted ineffectiveness. This, of course, is not
possible. We simply cannot announce a new rule of law and then find
counsel ineffective for failing to predict same. **\[ ... \]**

The relief appellant seeks represents a significant departure from the
current state of the law. Despite its compelling nature, it cannot be
the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

Judgment of sentence affirmed.

709 N.W.2d 560 (2006)

STATE of Iowa, Appellee,\
v.\
John Michael BOLSINGER, Appellant.

No. 03-0823.

Supreme Court of Iowa.

February 10, 2006.

**\[ ... \]**

## LARSON, Justice.

John Michael Bolsinger appealed his convictions of third-degree sexual
abuse under Iowa Code section 709.4(1) (2001), sexual exploitation by a
counselor under Iowa Code section 709.15(2), and sexual misconduct with
juvenile offenders under Iowa Code section 709.16(2). Bolsinger **\[ ...
\]**was sentenced to a combination of concurrent and consecutive
sentences totaling a term not exceeding thirty-seven years. **\[ ...
\]**

Bolsinger was the program supervisor of a highly structured state
facility for delinquent boys, the Wittenmyer Youth Center, in August
2001 when the Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) conducted an
investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Bolsinger. The
investigation revealed, through interviews with past and present youth
at the camp, that Bolsinger would take boys into a private room and
touch their genitals, saying he was checking for bruises, scratches,
hernias, and testicular cancer. The testimony of the boys revealed that
Bolsinger asked permission to touch them in this way and that he did not
appear to them to be gaining any sexual gratification from the touching.
The boys testified that they were not aware that they were being touched
in a sexual manner, and they would not have consented if they had known
the true reason for the touching. However, they also testified that,
given the nature of the structured program, it was almost impossible for
them to make choices of their own or to refuse the request of an
instructor.

**\[ ... \]**

Under Iowa Code section 709.4,

> \[a\] person commits sexual abuse in the third degree when the person
> performs a sex act under any of the following circumstances:
>
> 1\. The act is done by force or against the will of the other person,
> whether or not the other person is the person\'s spouse or is
> cohabiting with the person.

In applying the \"force or against the will\" language of section 709.4,
the court submitted Instruction No. 21:

> Concerning \[the third-degree sexual abuse counts\] the State must
> prove that the defendant committed a sex act \"by force or against the
> will\" of the alleged victim in that Instruction. In order to do so,
> however, the State does not have to prove that the alleged victim
> physically resisted the defendant\'s acts. The force used by the
> defendant does not have to be physical. *An act may be done \"by force
> and against the will\" of another if the other\'s consent or
> acquiescence is procured by:*
>
> *1. threats of violence; or*
>
> *2. deception, which may include deception concerning the nature of
> the act or deception concerning the defendant\'s* **\[ ... \]***right
> to exercise authority over the other under the circumstances.*
>
> You may consider all of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\'s
> act in deciding whether the act was done by force or against the will
> of the alleged victim.

**\[ ... \]**

The court stated that its authority for giving this instruction was
found in Iowa Code section 709.5, which provides:

> Under the provisions of this chapter it shall not be necessary to
> establish physical resistance by a person in order to establish that
> an act of sexual abuse was committed by force or against the will of
> the person. *However, the circumstances surrounding the commission of
> the act may be considered in determining whether or not the act was
> done by force or against the will of the other.*

**\[ ... \]**The court also relied on the case of *State v. Vander
Esch,* 662 N.W.2d 689 (Iowa Ct.App.2002). In *Vander Esch* the
defendant, an owner of a pizza restaurant, employed teenage boys. He
informed two of these employees that he was doing a scientific research
project and asked them to provide him semen samples for this purpose. He
promised to pay \$50 for the samples should their sperm count be high
enough. Vander Esch was present during the procedure and took possession
of the semen samples.**\[ ... \]** Vander Esch was not authorized by any
scientific body to collect semen samples, and the victims indicated that
they would not have consented to these acts had they known that no
scientific research existed. **\[ ... \]**Vander Esch was charged with
four counts of third-degree sexual abuse under Iowa Code section
709.4(1). **\[ ... \]**

In *Vander Esch* the district court ruled that**\[ ... \]** fraud and
deception may vitiate consent. The court of appeals upheld that
decision, classifying the fraud in question as fraud in fact, as opposed
to fraud in the inducement (concepts we later discuss), and therefore,
the act was done \"by force or against the will\" of the boys.

Bolsinger argues that the acts which occurred were hand-to-genital
contact, which was expressly agreed to by the boys. He argues that his
unexpressed purpose, apparently sexual gratification, was collateral to
the act itself and, therefore, constituted fraud only in the inducement.
As such, the fraud does not vitiate consent, according to him. **\[ ...
\]** Bolsinger argues **\[ ... \]**that *Vander Esch* erroneously
characterized the consent to semen sampling as being produced by fraud
in fact, and therefore, any consent was vitiated.

If an act is done that is different from the act the defendant said he
would perform, this is fraud in fact. If the act is done as the
defendant stated it would be, but it is for some collateral or ulterior
purpose, this is fraud in the inducement. Fraud in fact vitiates
consent; fraud in the inducement does not. *See* Rollin M. Perkins &
Ronald N. Boyce, *Criminal Law* ch. 9, § 3, at 1079 (3d ed.1982)
\[hereinafter Perkins & Boyce\]. In other words,

> if deception causes a misunderstanding as to the fact itself (fraud in
> the *factum*) there is no legally-recognized consent because what
> happened is not that for which consent was given; whereas consent
> induced by fraud is as effective as other consent, so far as direct
> and immediate legal consequences are concerned, if the deception
> relates not to the thing done but merely to some collateral matter
> (fraud in the inducement).

*Id.; accord* Wayne R. LaFave, *Substantive Criminal Law* § 6.5(a), at
506 (2d ed.2003) (stating that \"fraud in the factum involves a form of
deception which results in a misunderstanding by the victim as to the
very fact of the defendant\'s conduct\").

Cases illustrating fraud in fact have often involved victims undergoing
medical examination or treatment. In many cases, the victims consented
to an examination, only to find that the doctor engaged in sex acts.
**\[ ... \]**

Bolsinger argues that each of these young men was told what the touching
would consist of and that they were then touched in the exact manner
they expected. Thus, he argues, any fraud was fraud in the inducement,
not fraud in fact.

In Bolsinger\'s case, if the boys had consented to acts such as
massaging their legs and instead Bolsinger had touched their genital
area, this would clearly be fraud in fact; they would have consented to
one act but subjected to a different one. That is not the case, however.
We conclude that the consents given here were based on fraud in the
inducement, not on fraud in fact, as the victims were touched in exactly
the manner represented to them. The consents, therefore, were not
vitiated.

**\[ ... \]**

The defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his
motion for directed verdict as to all charges because \"sex acts,\"
under **\[ ... \]**the Code, were not proved. We have already determined
that Bolsinger\'s conviction of third-degree sexual abuse cannot stand.
The remaining charges, sexual abuse by a counselor or therapist and
sexual misconduct with offenders, both require proof of sex acts.
Bolsinger argues that none of the young men testified there was anything
sexual going on and that the evidence was insufficient to establish the
existence of sex acts. The jury was instructed, based on Iowa Code
section 702.17, that a \"sex act\" is

> \[a\]ny sexual contact between the fingers or hand of one person and
> the genitals or anus of another person. \`Genitals\' include the
> scrotum and penis. You may consider the type of contact and the
> circumstances surrounding it in deciding whether the contact was
> sexual in nature.

We believe there was substantial evidence to support the jury\'s finding
that sex acts had been committed. Direct evidence is not required.

> The sexual nature of the contact can be determined from the type of
> contact and the circumstances surrounding it. . . .
>
> . . . Other relevant circumstances include but are not limited to the
> relationship between the defendant and the victim; whether anyone else
> was present; the length of the contact; the purposefulness of the
> contact; whether there was a legitimate, nonsexual purpose for the
> contact; where and when the contact took place; and the conduct of the
> defendant and victim before and after the contact.

**\[ ... \]** The evidence shows that Bolsinger was acting outside the
scope of his duties, his actions took place in private, and he did not
document these procedures, contrary to the policy at Wittenmyer.
Bolsinger had no medical training other than information he had received
in school on testicular cancer and self-examination and was in a
position of power over the victims. Considered in light of this evidence
a rational finder of fact could conclude that Bolsinger committed sex
acts under the guise of performing medical examinations. The trial court
did not err in overruling his motions for judgment of acquittal on the
charges of sexual abuse by a counselor or sexual misconduct with
offenders.

We reverse the convictions for third-degree sexual abuse and affirm the
remaining convictions. We remand for resentencing without regard to the
third-degree sexual abuse convictions under Iowa Code section 709.4(1).

People v. Acosta

 

### *People v. Acosta*

California Court of Appeals

284 Cal. App.3d 1375 (1991)

 

At 10 p.m. on March 10, 1987, Officers Salceda and Francis of the Santa
Ana Police Department\'s automobile theft detail saw Acosta in Elvira
Salazar\'s stolen Nissan Pulsar parked on the street. The officers
approached Acosta and identified themselves. Acosta inched the Pulsar
forward, then accelerated rapidly. He led Salceda, Francis and officers
from other agencies on a 48--mile chase along numerous surface streets
and freeways throughout Orange County. The chase ended near Acosta\'s
residence in Anaheim.

During the chase, Acosta engaged in some of the most egregious driving
tactics imaginable. He ran stop signs and red lights, and drove on the
wrong side of streets, causing oncoming traffic to scatter or swerve to
avoid colliding with him. Once, when all traffic lanes were blocked by
vehicles stopped for a red light, he used a dirt shoulder to circumvent
stationary vehicles and pass through the intersection. When leaving the
freeway in Anaheim, he drove over a cement shoulder.

Throughout the pursuit, Acosta weaved in and out of traffic, cutting in
front of other cars and causing them to brake suddenly. At one point on
the freeway, he crossed three lanes of traffic, struck another car,
jumped the divider between the freeway and a transition lane, and passed
a tanker truck, forcing it to swerve suddenly to avoid a collision.

Acosta generally drove at speeds between 60 and 90 miles per hour,
slowing only when necessary. During several turns, his wheels lost
traction. When an officer was able to drive parallel to the Pulsar for a
short distance, Acosta looked in his direction and smiled. Near the end
of the chase, one of the Pulsar\'s front tires blew out, but Acosta
continued to drive at 55 to 60 miles per hour, crossing freeway traffic
lanes.

Police helicopters from Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, and
Newport Beach assisted in the chase by tracking Acosta. During the early
part of the pursuit, the Costa Mesa and Newport Beach craft were used,
pinpointing Acosta\'s location with their high beam spotlights. The
Costa Mesa helicopter was leading the pursuit, in front of and below the
Newport Beach helicopter. As they flew into Newport Beach, the pilots
agreed the Newport Beach craft should take the lead. The normal
procedure for such a maneuver is for the lead helicopter to move to the
right and swing around clockwise behind the other craft while climbing
to an altitude of 1,000 feet. At the same time, the trailing helicopter
descends to 500 feet while maintaining a straight course.

At the direction of the Costa Mesa pilot, the Newport Beach helicopter
moved forward and descended while the Costa Mesa helicopter banked to
the right. Shortly after commencing this procedure, the Costa Mesa
helicopter, having terminated radio communication, came up under the
Newport Beach helicopter from the right rear and collided with it. Both
helicopters fell to the ground. Three occupants in the Costa Mesa
helicopter died as a result of the crash.

Menzies Turner, a retired Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
investigator, testified as an expert and concluded the accident occurred
because the Costa Mesa helicopter, the faster of the two aircraft, made
a 360--degree turn and closed too rapidly on the Newport Beach
helicopter. He opined the Costa Mesa helicopter\'s pilot violated an FAA
regulation prohibiting careless and reckless operation of an aircraft by
failing to properly clear the area, not maintaining communication with
the Newport Beach helicopter, failing to keep the other aircraft in view
at all times, and not changing his altitude. He also testified the Costa
Mesa pilot violated another FAA regulation prohibiting operation of one
aircraft so close to another as to create a collision hazard.2

Turner could not think of any reason for the Costa Mesa helicopter\'s
erratic movement. The maneuver was not a difficult one, and was not
affected by the ground activity at the time. He had never heard of a
midair collision between two police helicopters involved in tracking a
ground pursuit, and had never investigated a midair collision involving
helicopters.

**\[ ... \]**

Acosta claims there was insufficient evidence **\[ ... \]** that he
proximately caused the deaths of the victims, a**\[ ... \]**

As to the proximate cause issue, Acosta argues that although a collision
between ground vehicles was a foreseeable result of his conduct, one
between airborne helicopters was not, noting his expert had never heard
of a similar incident. He also contends the Costa Mesa helicopter
pilot\'s violation of FAA regulations was a superseding cause. Because
the deaths here were unusual, to say the least, the issue deserves
special scrutiny.

"Proximate cause" is the term historically used to separate those
results for which an actor will be held responsible from those not
carrying such responsibility. The term is, in a sense, artificial,
serving matters of policy surrounding tort and criminal law and based
partly on expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice.
Because such concerns are sometimes more a matter of "common sense" than
pure logic, the line of demarcation is flexible, and attempts to lay
down uniform tests which apply evenly in all situations have failed.
That does not mean general guidelines and approaches to analysis cannot
be constructed.

The threshold question in examining causation is whether the
defendant\'s act was an "actual cause" of the victim\'s injury. It is a
sine qua non test: But for the defendant\'s act would the injury have
occurred? Unless an act is an actual cause of the injury, it will not be
considered a proximate cause.

The next inquiry is whether the defendant\'s act was a "substantial
factor" in the injury. In California, the substantial factor issue has
arisen most often where multiple causes act concurrently, but
independently, to produce the harm. The test is one of exclusion only. 
Unless a cause is a substantial factor in the harm it will not be
considered a proximate cause, but some substantial factor causes may not
be deemed proximate causes.

\[The Court then focused on California cases which held that proximate
cause often boils down to the question of foreseeability.\]

*Prosser* and *Keeton*, in an in-depth discussion of the dynamics of
foresight, conclude that although it is desirable to exclude extremely
remarkable and unusual results from the purview of proximate cause, it
is virtually impossible to express a logical verbal formula which will
produce uniform results. I agree. The standard should be simply stated,
exclude extraordinary results, and allow the trier of fact to determine
the issue on the particular facts of the case using "the common sense of
the common man as to common things." As with other ultimate issues,
appellate courts must review that determination, giving due deference to
the trier of fact.

The "highly extraordinary result" standard serves that purpose. It is
consistent with the definition of foreseeability used in California. It
does not involve the defendant\'s state of mind, but focuses upon the
objective conditions present when he acts. Like numerous other legal
definitions, what it means in practice will be determined as case law
develops. Limitations arising from the mental state of the actor can be
left to concepts like malice, recklessness and negligence.

Because the highly extraordinary result standard is consistent with the
limitation on direct causes, it simplifies the proximate cause inquiry.
The analysis is: (1) was the defendant\'s conduct the actual cause of
the harm (but for his actions would it have occurred as it did)? (2) was
the result an intended consequence of the act? (3) was the defendant\'s
action a substantial factor in the harm? and (4) was the result highly
extraordinary in light of the circumstances?

If the first question is answered no, proximate cause is lacking. If
answered yes, the next question must be examined. If the second question
is answered yes, proximate cause is established. If answered no, the
next question must be examined. If the third question is answered no,
proximate cause is lacking. If answered yes, proximate cause is
established unless the fourth question is answered yes, in which case it
is lacking. The analysis does away with the need to consider the
distinction between direct, concurrent, contributory, and dependent and
independent intervening causes. It focuses, as it should, upon the role
the defendant\'s act played in the harm, limiting culpability only where
the conduct was de minimis or the result highly extraordinary.

Here, but for Acosta\'s conduct of fleeing the police, the helicopters
would never have been in position for the crash. However, there was no
evidence he intended the harm, so I must examine questions three and
four.

Although an extremely close question, Acosta\'s conduct was a
substantial factor in causing the crash. He was fleeing when the
accident occurred, and there was no lapse of time between his flight and
the crash---his action had not "come to rest." The only other factor
operating at the time was the improper flight pattern of the Costa Mesa
pilot. Although Acosta\'s horrendous driving did not cause the
helicopter\'s improper maneuver, his flight undoubtedly infused
excitement and tension into the situation, which can be considered to be
a substantial factor. No similar case has held otherwise, although the
third party collisions all have involved accidents on the ground.

The result was not highly extraordinary. Although a two-helicopter
collision was unknown to expert witness Turner and no reported cases
describe one, it was "a possible consequence which reasonably might have
been contemplated." Given the emotional dynamics of any police pursuit,
there is an "appreciable probability" that one of the pursuers, in the
heat of the chase, may act negligently or recklessly to catch the
quarry. That no pursuits have ever before resulted in a helicopter crash
or midair collision is more a comment on police flying skill and
technology than upon the innate probabilities involved.

\[The Court next concluded that, although Acosta was the legal cause of
the crash, the murder conviction could not be sustained. "\[T\]here is
no evidence Acosta had a conscious disregard for any risk to the
helicopters. Although he stated he knew his conduct was dangerous "to
the bone," nothing connected the statement to the aerial surveillance.
His knowledge that there were helicopters involved in the pursuit does
not suffice. In the absence of more evidence, no reasonable juror could
find a conscious disregard for a risk which is barely objectively
cognizable."\]

George Sheinberg, Brooklyn, for defendant.

E. LEO MILONAS, Judge.

The defendant was indicted on September 28, 1977 for two counts of
murder in the second degree and arson in the third degree after he
allegedly intentionally set fire to a couch, thus causing a serious fire
on the fifth floor of an abandoned building at 358 East 8th Street in
New York County. The New York City Fire Department, in responding to the
conflagration, arrived to find the rear portion of the fifth and sixth
floors burning. The firemen attempted to bring the situation under
control, but making no progress and there being no additional assistance
available, they decided to withdraw from the building. At that point,
they were suddenly enveloped by a dense smoke, which was later
discovered to have arisen from another independent fire that had broken
out on the second floor.

Although this fire was also determined to have originated in arson,
there is virtually no evidence implicating the defendant in its
responsibility. However, the combination of the thick smoke and the
fifth floor fire made evacuation from the premises extremely hazardous,
and, in the process, Fireman Martin Celic sustained injuries from which
he subsequently died. Accordingly, the defendant was accused of murder
in the second degree for having, \"Under circumstances evincing a
depraved indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which
created a grave risk of death to another person,\" thereby causing the
death of Martin Celic, and with felony murder. The third charge of the
indictment, arson, is not at issue for purposes of the instant
application.

It is the defendant\'s contention that the evidence before the grand
jury is insufficient to support the first two counts. He argues that
**\[ ... \]**murder requires a causal link between the underlying crime
and the death, a connection which, in the defendant\'s view, is here
lacking.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

Clearly, an obscure or merely probable connection between the
defendant\'s conduct and another person\'s death is not enough to
support a charge of homicide. People v. Stewart, supra. In Stewart, the
victim had been operated upon for a stab wound in the stomach inflicted
by the defendant. Afterwards, the surgeon performed an entirely
unrelated hernia procedure on him, and he died. According to the court,
\"the prosecutor must, at least, prove that the defendant\'s conduct was
an actual cause of death, in the sense that it forged a link in the
chain of causes which actually brought about the death . . . .\" At p.
697, 389 N.Y.S.2d at p. 807, 358 N.E.2d at p. 491. In this instance, the
possibility that death resulted from a factor not attributable to the
defendant could not be ruled out beyond a reasonable doubt, since the
patient would, in all likelihood, have survived except for the hernia
operation.

**\[ ... \]**

Moreover, the defendant\'s conduct need not be the sole and exclusive
factor in the victim\'s death. **\[ ... \]**an individual is criminally
liable if his conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death, and
the ultimate harm is something which should have been foreseen as being
reasonably related to his acts. It is irrelevant that, in this instance
the fire which had erupted on the second floor intervened, thus
contributing to the conditions that culminated in the death of Fireman
Celic. In Kibbe, the victim was killed when he was struck by a truck.
This did not relieve the defendants in that case from criminal
responsibility for his murder, as it does not absolve the defendant
here. Certainly, it was foreseeable that firemen would respond to the
situation, thus exposing them, along with the persons already present in
the vicinity, to a life-threatening danger. The fire set by the
defendant was an indispensable link in the chain of events that resulted
in the death. It continued to burn out of control, greatly adding to the
problem of evacuating the building by blocking off one of the access
routes. At the very least, the defendant\'s act, as was the case in
Kibbe, placed the deceased in a position where he was particularly
vulnerable to the separate and independent force, in this instance, the
fire on the second floor.

Consequently, the defendant\'s motion to dismiss the first count of the
indictment is denied.

People v. Warner-Lambert

 

### *People v. Warner-Lambert Co.*

Court of Appeals of New York

414 N.E.2d 660 (N.Y. 1980)

 

The indictment charges each defendant with six counts of manslaughter in
the second degree in violation of section 125.15 of the Penal Law and
six counts of criminally negligent homicide in violation of section
125.10 of the Penal Law in consequence of the deaths of six employees
which resulted from a massive explosion and fire at the Long Island City
Warner-Lambert plant about 2:30 A.M. on November 21, 1976.

On the day on which the explosion occurred, Freshen-Up Gum, which is
retailed in the shape of a square tablet with a jellylike center, was
being produced at the Warner-Lambert plant by a process in which filled
ropes of the gum were passed through a bed of magnesium stearate (MS), a
dry, dustlike lubricant which was applied by hand, then into a die-cut
punch (a Uniplast machine) which was sprayed with a cooling agent
(liquid nitrogen), where the gum was formed into the square tablets.
Both the MS (normally an inert, organic compound) and the liquid
nitrogen were employed to prevent the chicle from adhering to the sizing
and cutting machinery, the tendency to adhere being less if a dry
lubricant was used and the punch was kept at a low temperature. The
process produced a dispersal of MS dust in the air and an accumulation
of it at the base of the Uniplast machine and on overhead pipes; some
also remained ambient in the atmosphere in the surrounding area. 

**\[ ... \]**

On November 21, 1976 defendant Warner-Lambert was operating six Uniplast
machines in the production of Freshen-Up Gum on the fourth floor of its
Long Island City plant. The machines were in almost constant operation;
however, at the time of the catastrophic explosion near the end of one
of the work shifts only one machine (designated the "D" machine) was in
operation and employees were engaged in removing settled MS dust from
the base of that machine and from overhead pipes by broom sweeping and
by the use of airhoses. Suddenly an explosion occurred in the area of
the operating machine, followed almost immediately by a second, much
larger explosion accompanied by flames which caused injuries to more
than 50 workers in the area (six of whom did not survive) and extensive
damage to the building and equipment, which was attributed to burning of
ambient dust and explosion rather than general fire. Thorough
postcatastrophe investigation eliminated intentional or "man-caused"
ignition as the origin of the event. A New York City Fire Marshal and an
investigator for the United States Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, both of whom examined the scene, testified before the
Grand Jury that a primary explosion had occurred at the "D" machine
which dispersed added MS dust into the atmosphere and could have caused
the second, greater explosion. There was testimony that the ceiling of
the floor below the "D" machine had been covered with peeling paint,
indicating that the temperature of that machine was colder than the
others and that an examination of the machine itself after the explosion
had shown that its base, made of cast iron, had cracked, perhaps by
reason of the cold. An employee present at the time of the occurrence
testified that he had observed a spark in the area of the "D" machine
immediately prior to the event. Although there was no direct proof as to
what had triggered the early morning disaster, the People introduced
expert testimony hypothesizing that there might have been a mechanical
sparking induced by a breakup of metal parts of the Uniplast machine.
Also presented was testimony by one of the People\'s experts who
theorized that liquid oxygen produced through liquefaction occurring in
the Uniplast machine was ignited by the impact of a moving metal part
and that this touched off the dispersed MS dust present.

With respect to the quantity of ambient MS dust in the area of the
Uniplast machines (the presence of which was the basis for the People\'s
submission to the Grand Jury of evidence against the defendants
ultimately indicted), there was proof that an inspection of the plant by
Warner-Lambert\'s insurance carrier in February, 1976 had resulted in
advice to the insured that the dust condition in the Freshen-Up gum
production area presented an explosion hazard and that the MS
concentration was above the LEL, together with recommendations for
installation of a dust exhaust system and modification of electrical
equipment to meet standards for dust areas. Although a variety of
proposals for altering the dust condition were considered by the
individual defendants in consultations and communications with each
other and some alterations in the MS application were made, both ambient
and settled MS dust were still present on November 21, 1976, as the
result of an executive decision to work toward the eventual elimination
of MS entirely by modification of the Freshen-Up equipment. This
modification had been accomplished with respect to only one Uniplast
machine at the date of the explosion, when approximately 500 pounds of
MS a day were still being used in Freshen-Up production. Employees were
wearing face masks and goggles to protect their eyes and breathing
passages, and just prior to the tragedy, when sweeping and airhosing of
accumulated MS were in progress, there was rising dust and a "heavy fog"
or "mist" all around.

First, we look at the evidence as to the actual event or chain of events
which triggered the explosion\--evidence which may only be characterized
as hypothetical and speculative. There was direct testimony by
eyewitnesses, confirmed by reconstruction of the physical evidence that
two explosions occurred. The first was a low-order detonation, occurring
approximately two seconds before the major explosion, at the base of the
"D" Uniplast machine, which was itself found to be in a substantially
fragmented condition with gears, metal shafts, and other parts broken up
and displaced; the second, occurring in rapid succession, was a major
explosion accompanied by fire which caused the massive destruction and
personal injuries. The prosecution hypothesizes that under what it
describes as "the most plausible of theories" the initial detonation was
attributable to mechanical sparking resulting from the breakup of the
metal parts of the Uniplast machine, possibly occasioned by the
machine\'s having become overheated or overloaded, by vibration, or by
slipping of components. Testimony supporting this hypothesis included
descriptions of the condition of the machine after the event, expert
testimony that the physical evidence suggested mechanical failure prior
to the first explosion and testimony of prior instances in which the
machine had become overheated or metal parts had broken off. The
District Attorney adds that "ignition produced by an electrical spark or
arc emission from the non-explosion proof, over loaded Uniplast motor
was not ruled out either."

**\[ ... \]**

Viewed most favorably to the People, the proof with respect to the
actual cause of the explosion is speculative only, and as to at least
one of the major hypotheses\--that involving oxygen liquefaction\--there
was no evidence that that process was foreseeable or known to any of the
defendants. In sum, there is no proof sufficient to support a finding
that defendants foresaw or should have foreseen the physical cause of
the explosion. This being so there was not legally sufficient evidence
to establish the offenses charged or any lesser included offense.

It has been the position of the People that but-for causation is all
that is required for the imposition of criminal liability. Thus, it is
their submission, reduced to its simplest form, that there was evidence
of a foreseeable and indeed foreseen risk of explosion of MS dust and
that in consequence of defendants\' failure to remove the dust a fatal
explosion occurred. The chain of physical events by which the explosion
was set off, i.e., its particular cause, is to them a matter of total
indifference. On oral argument the People contended that liability could
be imposed if the cause of the explosion were the lighting of a match by
an uninvited intruder or the striking of a bolt of lightning. In effect
they would hold defendants to the status of guarantors until the ambient
dust was removed. It thus appears that the People would invoke an
expanded application of proximate cause principles lifted from the civil
law of torts.

We have rejected the application of any such sweeping theory of
culpability under our criminal law, however. We recently considered
concepts of criminal culpability grounded in recklessness or negligence
in *People v. Kibbe* (35 N.Y.2d 407). In that case the defendants had
abandoned their helplessly intoxicated robbery victim in subfreezing
temperatures, without shoes or eyeglasses, by the side of an unlighted
highway, and he was shortly thereafter struck and killed by a passing
motorist. The critical issue in the case was whether the defendants
should be held criminally liable for murder when the particular cause of
death was vehicular impact rather than freezing. Under the theory now
advanced by the People it would have been irrelevant that death had been
the consequence of one particular chain of causation rather than
another; it would have been enough that the defendants exposed their
victim to the risk of death and that he died. That, of course, was not
the analysis of culpability that we adopted. Recognizing that "\[a\]
distance separates the negligence which renders one criminally liable
from that which establishes civil liability" \-- both as to quantum and
content of proof\--we held that "the defendants should not be found
guilty unless their conduct \'was a cause of death sufficiently direct
as to meet the requirements of the criminal, and not the tort, law.\'"
"We subscribe to the requirement that the defendants\' actions must be a
sufficiently direct cause of the ensuing death before there can be any
imposition of criminal liability, and recognize, of course, that this
standard is greater than that required to serve as a basis for tort
liability." Thus, we were concerned for the nature of the chain of
particularized events which in fact led to the victim\'s death; it was
not enough that death had occurred as the result of the defendants\'
abandonment of their helpless victim. To analogize the factual situation
in the case now before us to that in *Kibbe* it might be hypothesized
that the abandoned victim in *Kibbe* instead of being either frozen to
death or killed when struck by a passing motor vehicle was killed when
struck by an airplane making an emergency landing on the highway or when
hit by a stray bullet from a hunter\'s rifle\--occasions of death not
reasonably to have been foreseen when the defendants abandoned their
victim.

**\[ ... \]**

For the reasons stated, we conclude that there was not legally
sufficient evidence in this case on the premise of which any jury could
permissibly have imposed criminal liability on any of these defendants.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and
the indictment dismissed.

**\[ ... \]**At age seventeen, Michelle Carter was charged with
involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender for the suicide death of
Conrad Roy, age eighteen. **\[ ... \]**The defendant was convicted as
charged and has **\[ ... \]** appealed. **\[ ... \]**

 

[Facts]{.underline}.**\[ ... \]**

 

On July 13, 2014, the victim's body was found in his truck, which was
parked in a store parking lot in Fairhaven. He had committed suicide by
inhaling carbon monoxide that was produced by a gasoline powered water
pump located in the truck.

 

The defendant, who lived in Plainville, and the victim, who divided his
time between his mother's home in Fairhaven and his father's home in
Mattapoisett, first met in 2012, when they were both visiting relatives
in Florida. Thereafter, they rarely saw each other in person, but they
maintained a long-distance relationship by electronic text
messaging[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X2f34e03fad7a753c61ff6787255ae5f279f0fcd)
and cellular telephone (cell phone) conversations. A frequent subject of
their communications was the victim's fragile mental health, including
his suicidal thoughts. Between October 2012 and July 2014, the victim
attempted suicide several times by various means, including overdosing
on over-the-counter medication, drowning, water poisoning, and
suffocation. None of these attempts succeeded, as the victim abandoned
each attempt or sought rescue.

 

**\[ ... \]**At first, the defendant urged the victim to seek
professional help for his mental illness. Indeed, in early June 2014,
the defendant, who was planning to go to McLean Hospital for treatment
of an eating disorder, asked the victim to join her, saying that the
professionals there could help him with his depression and that they**\[
... \]**could mutually support each other. The victim rebuffed these
efforts, and the tenor of their communications changed. As the victim
continued researching suicide methods and sharing his findings with the
defendant, the defendant helped plan how, where, and when he would do
so,[^3^](#X113636096a4a005c9716beae0d36839ac41bdc7) and downplayed his
fears about how his suicide would affect his
family.[^4^](#Xee891772360d782c4cec8877de12e534288570b) She also
repeatedly chastised **\[ ... \]**him for his indecision and delay,
texting, for example, that he "better not be bull shiting me and saying
you're gonna do this and then purposely get caught" and made him
"promise" to kill
himself.[^5^](#X1bc67bbb09ef7e5b6dc48138d12669747d45049) The trial judge
found that the **\[ ... \]** defendant's actions from **\[ ... \]**June
30 to July 12 constituted wanton or reckless conduct in serious
disregard of the victim's well-being, but that this behavior did not
cause his death. This and other evidence, however, informed and
instructed the judge about the nature of their relationship and the
defendant's understanding of "the feelings that he has exchanged with
her \-- his ambiguities, his fears, his concerns," on the next night.

 

In the days leading to July 12, 2014, the victim continued planning his
suicide, including by securing a water pump that he would use to
generate carbon monoxide in his closed
truck.[^6^](#Xae6de9683c46806e034fd6bd4fc9249eb3f0127) On July 12, the
victim drove his truck to a local store's parking**\[ ... \]**lot **\[
... \]**and started the pump. While the pump was operating, filling the
truck with carbon monoxide, the defendant and victim were in contact by
cell phone. Cell phone records showed that one call of over forty
minutes had been placed by the victim to the defendant, and a second
call of similar length by the defendant to the victim, during the time
when police believe the victim was in his truck committing suicide.
There is no contemporaneous record of what the defendant and victim said
to each other during those calls.

 

The defendant, however, sent a text to a friend at 8:02 P.M., shortly
after the second call: "he just called me and there was a loud noise
like a motor and I heard moaning like someone was in pain, and he
wouldn't answer when I said his name. I stayed on the phone for like 20
minutes and that's all I heard." And at 8:25 P.M., she again texted that
friend: "I think he just killed himself." She sent a similar text to
another friend at 9:24 P.M.: "He called me, and I heard like muffled
sounds and some type of motor running, and it was like that for 20
minutes, and he wouldn't answer. I think he killed himself." Weeks
later, on September 15, 2014, she texted the first friend again, saying
in part:

 

"I failed \[the victim\] I wasn't supposed to let that happen and now
I'm realizing I failed him. \[H\]is death is my fault like honestly I
could have stopped him I was on the phone with him and he got out of the
car because it was working and he got scared and I fucking told him to
get back in \... because I knew he would do it all over again the next
day and I couldn't have him live the way he was living anymore I
couldn't do it I wouldn't let him."

 

The judge found that the victim got out of the truck, seeking fresh air,
in a way similar to how he had abandoned his prior **\[ ... \]** suicide
attempts. The judge also focused his verdict**\[ ... \]** on "those
final moments, when the victim had gotten out of his truck, expressing
doubts about killing himself." The judge found that when the defendant
realized he had gotten out of the truck, she instructed him to get back
in, knowing that it had become a toxic environment and knowing the
victim's fears, doubts, and fragile mental state. The victim followed
that instruction. Thereafter, the defendant, knowing the victim was
inside the truck and that the water pump was operating \-- the judge
noted that she could hear the sound of the pump and the victim's
coughing \-- took no steps to save him. She did not call emergency
personnel, contact the victim's
family,[^7^](#X991f5c45bcde7c843f6a1278701060ceb9a5270) or instruct him
to get out of the truck. The victim remained in the truck and succumbed
to the carbon monoxide. The judge concluded that the defendant's actions
and her failure to act constituted, "each and all," wanton and reckless
conduct that caused the victim's death.

 

[Discussion]{.underline}. **\[ ... \]**

 

A. [Sufficiency of the evidence]{.underline}. The defendant argues that
her conviction was unsupported by sufficient
evidence.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X3d28aafd51feca8358c5a1b486b71e8f17af0f8)

 

The defendant **\[ ... \]** points out that the judge's remarks on the
record, explaining the guilty verdict, contain no express finding that
her words had a "coercive quality" that caused the victim to follow
through with his suicide. **\[ ... \]** He found: "She instructs \[the
victim\] to get back into the truck, well knowing of all of the feelings
that he has exchanged with her \-- his ambiguities, his fears, his
concerns." This, the judge found, constituted "wanton and reckless
conduct by \[the defendant\], creating a situation where there is a high
degree of likelihood that substantial harm would result to \[the
victim\]."[^9^](#Xf3dae3c8aaeac1c0141608aeb7546a7d85c8454) The judge**\[
... \]**then further found that this conduct caused the victim's death
beyond a reasonable doubt. His finding of causation in this context, at
that precise moment in time, includes the concept of coercion, in the
sense of overpowering the victim's will.

 

This finding is supported by the temporal distinctions about causation
drawn by the judge. Until the victim got out of the truck, the judge
described the victim as the cause of his own suicidal actions and
reactions. This period of "self-causation" and "self-help," which is
completely consistent with his prior behavior, ended when he got out of
the truck. As the judge explained:

 

"It is apparent to this Court in reviewing the evidence that \[the
victim\] was struggling with his issues and seeing a way to address them
and took significant actions of his own toward that end. His research
was extensive. He spoke of it continually. He secured the generator. He
secured the water pump. He researched how to fix the generator. He
located his vehicle in an unnoticeable area and commenced his attempt by
starting the pump.

"[However, he breaks that chain of self-causation by exiting the
vehicle]{.underline}. He takes himself out of the toxic environment that
it has become. This is completely consistent with his earlier**\[ ...
\]**attempts at suicide. In October of 2012, when he attempted to drown
himself, he literally sought air. When he exited the truck, he literally
sought fresh air. And he told a parent of that attempt.

"Several weeks later, in October of 2012 again, he attempts, through the
use of pills, to take his life but calls a friend and assistance is
sought and treatment secured. That \[the victim\] may have tried and
maybe succeeded another time, after July 12 or 13 of 2014, is of no
consequence to this Court's deliberations." (Emphasis added.)

The judge found that, once the victim left the truck, the defendant
overpowered the victim's will and thus caused his death. As the
defendant herself explained, and we repeat due to its importance, "\[The
victim's\] death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him I
was on the phone with him and he got out of the \[truck\] because it was
working and he got scared and I fucking told him to get back in \...

let him."

 

Although we recognize that legal causation in the context of suicide is
an incredibly complex inquiry, we conclude that there was sufficient
evidence to support a finding of proof of such causation beyond a
reasonable doubt in the instant case. The judge could have properly
found, based on this evidence, that the vulnerable, confused, mentally
ill, eighteen year old victim had managed to save himself once again in
the midst of his latest suicide attempt, removing himself from the truck
as it filled with carbon monoxide. But then in this weakened state he
was badgered back into the gas-infused truck by the defendant, his
girlfriend and closest, if not only, confidant in this suicidal
planning, the person who had been constantly pressuring him to complete
their often discussed plan, fulfill his promise to her, and finally
commit suicide. And then after she convinced him to get back into the
carbon monoxide filled truck, she did absolutely nothing to help him:
she did not call for help or tell him to **\[ ... \]**get out of the
truck as she listened to him choke and die.

 

In sum, the evidence at trial, in the light most favorable to the
Commonwealth, was sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.

The defendant argues essentially that, when considering a juvenile's
actions under the objective measure of recklessness, we should consider
whether an ordinary [juvenile]{.underline} under the same circumstances
would have realized the gravity of the danger. It is clear from the
judge's findings, however, that he found the defendant's actions wanton
or reckless under the [subjective]{.underline} measure, that is, based
on her own knowledge of the danger to the victim and on her choice to
run the risk that he would comply with her instruction to get back into
the truck. That finding is amply supported by the trial record. Because
the defendant's conduct was wanton or reckless when evaluated under the
subjective standard, there is no need to decide whether a different
objective standard should apply to juveniles.

 

Moreover, it is clear from the judge's sentencing memorandum that he did
in fact consider the defendant's age and maturity when evaluating her
actions and that he was familiar with the relevant case law and
"mindful" of the general principles regarding juvenile brain
development. He**\[ ... \]** noted that on the day of the victim's
death, she was seventeen years and eleven months of age and at an
age-appropriate level of maturity. Her ongoing contact with the victim
in the days leading to his suicide, texting with him about suicide
methods and his plans and demanding that he carry out his plan rather
than continue to delay, as well as the lengthy cell phone conversations
on the night itself, showed that her actions were not spontaneous or
impulsive. And, as the judge specifically found, "\[h\]er age or level
of maturity does not explain away her knowledge of the effects of her
telling \[the victim\] to enter and remain in that toxic environment,
leading to his death." Where the judge found that the defendant ordered
the victim back into the truck knowing the danger of doing so, he
properly found that her actions were wanton or reckless, giving
sufficient consideration to her age and maturity.

 

**\[ ... \]**

 

[Conclusion]{.underline}. The evidence against the defendant proved
that, by her wanton or reckless conduct, she caused the victim's death
by suicide. Her conviction of involuntary manslaughter as a youthful
offender is not legally or constitutionally infirm. The judgment is
therefore affirmed.

Nebraska Supreme Court

269 Neb. 703, 695 N.W.2d 425

No. S-03-1399

2005-04-28

695 N.W.2d 425

**\[ ... \]**

Susana Muro was convicted by the district court for Dawson County of
child abuse resulting in the death of a child and sentenced to 20 years'
imprisonment. The Nebraska Court of Appeals affirmed her conviction,
finding there was sufficient evidence that she knowingly failed to
secure necessary medical care for her daughter, Vivianna Muro, after
becoming aware that the child had sustained a serious injury, and that
such failure was a proximate cause of the child's death. *State v.
Muro,* 13 Neb. App. 38, 688 N.W.2d 148 (2004). On further review, we
conclude that while the evidence in the record is sufficient to support
the finding that Muro knowingly and intentionally caused or permitted
Vivianna to be deprived of medical care, it is insufficient as a matter
of law to establish that such deprivation caused the child's death.

**\[ ... \]**

On October 27, 2002, Muro resided in Lexington, Nebraska, with her
husband, Jose Muro (Jose), and their children, a 4-year-old son and
8-month-old Vivianna. At approximately 3:20 p.m. on that day, Muro left
the children at home in the care of Jose while she ran errands. Vivianna
appeared normal at that time. When Muro returned home sometime after 6
p.m., Jose was holding Vivianna but the child was not crying as she
usually did when held by Jose. Muro inquired about Vivianna, and Jose
replied that she was asleep. He placed her in her crib while Muro fed
their son and performed various chores.

Between 7 and 7:30 p.m., Muro took Vivianna from her crib and noticed
that something was wrong. Vivianna was unresponsive and appeared
"dazed," and her eyes were "half open, half closed." Muro observed that
Vivianna was "limp, kind of like a rag doll." Over the next several
horns, both Muro and Jose called the Tri-County Hospital in Lexington
for advice without identifying themselves or disclosing that Vivianna
was limp and unresponsive. A nurse testified that she advised the
unidentified callers to bring the baby to the emergency room if they had
any concern or uncertainty regarding her condition. **\[ ... \]**

When she arrived at the hospital at approximately 11 p.m., Vivianna was
not breathing, her pupils were fixed and dilated, and she was limp and
cold. Although medical personnel performing resuscitation were able to
establish a heartbeat, they were never able to stabilize Vivianna or
establish spontaneous respiration. A physician diagnosed various
injuries, including a hematoma on the left side of her head. **\[ ...

Death occurred at 6:28 a.m. on October 28, 2002.

An autopsy was performed by Dr. Blaine Roffman the next day. He made
certain findings indicative of trauma, including torn skin over the
right lateral thorax and the left anterior thorax, broken and
hemorrhaged fingernails, recent bruising of the right side of the neck
and the midline of the forehead, bruising to "the left of the oral
cavity on the cheek," and a fracture of the left parietal skull. At
trial, Roffman ultimately opined that the cause of death was "a fracture
of the left parietal skull, which resulted in cerebral edema
\[swelling\], which resulted in brain death."

There is no contention or evidence that Muro inflicted or witnessed the
infliction of the fatal injuries. There is evidence that the injuries
occurred during the period when Muro was away from the family home on
October 27, 2002.

**\[ ... \]**

On November 19, 2002, Muro was charged by information with felony child
abuse resulting in death under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-707 (Cum. Supp.
2004). Muro stood mute at her arraignment, and a plea of not guilty was
entered for her. Following a bench trial at which Muro testified on her
own behalf, the district court entered an order finding Muro guilty of
the charged crime. The court found that Muro knowingly and intentionally
failed to provide necessary care, that Vivianna's condition worsened as
a result, and that the worsening of her condition ultimately led to her
death. The court specifically found that Muro's deprivation of care for
Vivianna contributed in a natural and continuous sequence to Vivianna's
death. At a subsequent sentencing hearing, the district court imposed
the minimum sentence for a Class IB felony of imprisonment for 20 years.
See Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-105 (Cum. Supp. 2002).

**\[ ... \]**

In her petition for further review, Muro assigns, restated, that the
Court of Appeals erred in (1) ruling that the State provided sufficient
evidence that any act or omission done by her was the proximate cause or
resulted in the death of Vivianna, **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

.

It is undisputed that Muro did not seek medical care for Vivianna for a
period of approximately 4 hours after she first noticed the child's
unresponsiveness and other abnormal symptoms. Muro argues in this appeal
that the State failed to prove both that the deprivation of care was
knowing and intentional on her part and that it resulted in the death of
Vivianna.

1\. State of Mind

Muro argues that because she did not realize or comprehend the extent of
Vivianna's injuries, she could not have knowingly and intentionally
deprived Vivianna of necessary medical care. The Court of Appeals
examined the evidence pertaining to the events which transpired during
the 4-hour period before Vivianna was taken to the hospital and
concluded that such evidence, viewed in a light favorable to the State,
was sufficient to support an inference that Muro knowingly and
intentionally failed to provide necessary medical care for Vivianna
after the seriousness of the child's condition became readily apparent
to her. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

\(b\) Medical Testimony

In this case, the State attempted to prove through the testimony of two
physicians that Muro's conduct was a proximate cause of the death.
Parys, the pediatrician who treated Vivianna during and after her
transport to Good Samaritan Hospital, testified at trial that there was
very little chance of saving her life while she was in his care. Parys
did state, with reasonable medical certainty, that "\[i\]f treatment was
sought earlier, then there would've been a chance of survival." On
cross-examination, he testified that he could not give a percentage of
what the chance for survival would have been. He stated that if
treatment had been sought immediately, survival was possible, but he
could not say it was probable. He opined that Vivianna "might have
survived" if treatment was sought earlier. He further testified that a
person's condition progressively worsens after the type of skull injury
suffered by Vivianna.

Dr. Randell Alexander, a pediatrician and an expert on child abuse,
testified that a brain could swell to the degree seen in Vivianna within
an hour, or it could also take several hours. He testified that in most
cases with this type of injury, a child will die within 1 to 2 hours
even with medical care. He opined, based upon the fact that Vivianna was
still alive 4 hours after the trauma was inflicted, that "this is an
injury that might have been survivable." He further testified that
because of the delay in seeking treatment, Viviánna's survival was
hopeless, but that there may have been a small amount of hope if prompt
treatment had been sought. **\[ ... \]**

On cross-examination, Alexander admitted the possibility that doctors
may not have been able to save Vivianna even if Muro had sought
immediate treatment. He could not say that she would have survived if
treatment had been sought 3 hours earlier. Alexander testified there was
a reasonable likelihood that Vivianna could have survived with early
treatment, but declined to say whether survival was possible or
probable. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

> **\[ ... \]**

\(d\) Disposition on Further Review

Our case law, as summarized above, establishes that criminal conduct is
a proximate cause of an event if the event in question would not have
occurred but for that conduct; conversely, conduct is not a proximate
cause of an event if that event would have occurred without such
conduct. **\[ ... \]** Thus, to establish that Muro's unlawful conduct
was a proximate cause of Vivianna's death, the State was required to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that but for Muro's delay in seeking
medical treatment, Vivianna would have survived her preexisting
traumatic head injury. We agree with the dissenting judge that the State
did not meet this burden. The State proved only the *possibility* of
survival with earlier treatment. Such proof is insufficient to satisfy
even the lesser civil burden of proof by a preponderance of the
evidence. See *Doe* v. *Zedek, supra.*

**\[ ... \]**

The State's failure to prove that Muro's unlawful conduct caused the
death, however, does not relieve her of criminal responsibility. As
noted above, § 28-707 includes multiple gradations of felony child
abuse, depending upon the result of the abusive conduct. We agree with
the trial court and the Court of Appeals that the State proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that Muro knowingly and intentionally deprived Vivianna
of necessary care. That finding is sufficient to sustain a conviction
for Class IIIA felony child abuse under § 28-707(4) without any proof of
resulting harm to the child. Accordingly, Muro's sentence must be
vacated and the cause remanded for imposition of an appropriate sentence
for the Class IIIA felony.

Questions on Causation

 

1.  Is there a way to reconcile or distinguish the very broad conception
of proximate cause on Acosta and Arzon with the narrow view in
Warner-Lambert?

 

2\. Stephenson was long considered an outlier exception to the general
rule that an intervening human actor - as in committing suicide or
overdosing\--cut off the chain of causation. Yet recent cases, including
Carter, are challenging the general rule. What are the pros and cons to
watering down or creating exceptions to the intervening huma actor rule?
What are the retributive and/or utilitarian arguments for doing so?

3\. Boro raises the issue of \"but for\" causation, something that
defendants rarely are able to show was not proven BRD, as Boro did here.
What kinds of evidence would help defendants do this?

Judge Rules Breonna Taylor's Boyfriend, Not the Police, Caused Her Death

 

https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2024/08/judge-rules-breonna-taylors-boyfriend-not-the-police-caused-her-death/

More than four years after Kentucky police barged into Breonna Taylor's
home in the middle of the night and shot her to death, her family is
still fighting for justice. And this week, a federal judge dealt them a
major blow.\
\
On Thursday, US District Judge Charles Simpson, a Ronald Reagan
appointee, dismissed felony charges against two of the former Louisville
officers involved in the police raid that led to Taylor's death.
Instead, the judge [ruled
that](https://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/sites/kywd/files/USA%20v.%20Jaynes%20Memorandum%20Opinion%20and%20Order.pdf)
Taylor's boyfriend was legally responsible for her death. The officers
still face other charges.\
\
Former Detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany were not
present at the raid on Taylor's home in March 2020, but they allegedly
lied to obtain a warrant for other officers to enter in search of drugs.
Taylor, a Black 26-year-old medical worker, had fallen asleep watching
the movie *Freedom Writers* when, a little after midnight, seven
plainclothes police barged through her door. Her boyfriend, Kenneth
Walker, thinking the officers were intruders, fired a single shot, and
the officers returned with a barrage of bullets that struck Taylor. As
she lay wounded, Walker called 911, still not realizing it was the
police who had attacked them.

In 2022 the Justice Department filed civil rights charges against four
current and former officers who were involved in her death, including
Jaynes and Meany. Not long afterward I was writing a profile of Taylor's
aunt, [Bianca
Austin](https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2023/06/after-the-police-kill-your-loved-one-who-can-you-lean-on/),
who told me that the family felt relieved about the prosecutions. "I was
just so happy," Austin said of the indictments. "I'm just grateful the
DOJ decided to do their job, that somebody decided to step up and say,
'This is not right.\'"\
\
Within a few weeks of the charges, one of the four officers, Kelly
Goodlett, [pleaded
guilty](https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2022/08/breonna-taylor-death-no-knock-raid-cops-lied-warrant/).
Goodlett said she and her colleagues lied to obtain the warrant by
claiming to have evidence they didn't have. More specifically, she said
she did not stop Jaynes when he falsely claimed to have proof that a
drug dealer was sending packages to Taylor's apartment. According to
prosecutors, the warrant application also stated that the dealer used
Taylor's address as his own, even though the detectives knew the dealer
did not live there. No drugs were found on the premises.

The lies allegedly continued later. News of Taylor's death sparked
widespread outrage. Thousands protested. As public backlash grew,
according to prosecutors, Goodlett and Jaynes met in Jaynes' garage to
scheme how they could cover up the false statements they had made. And
according to prosecutors, Meany allegedly lied to the FBI.\
\
The two cops who actually shot Taylor---Jonathan Mattingly and Myles
Cosgrove---were never charged. Prosecutors said they did not know their
colleagues had lied to obtain the warrant. Instead, the Justice
Department blamed the four other officers for Taylor's death. But on
Thursday, Judge Simpson disagreed. "While the indictment alleges that
Jaynes and Meany set off a series of events that ended in Taylor's
death, it also alleges that \[Taylor's boyfriend, Walker\] disrupted
those events when he decided to open fire" on the police, Simpson wrote.
Walker's "decision to open fire," he added, "is the legal cause of her
death."\
\
The ruling effectively reduced some of the felony charges against Jaynes
and Meany, which had carried a maximum sentence of life in prison, to
misdemeanors. But officers are not totally off the hook: The judge
refused to dismiss a charge against Jaynes for conspiracy and a charge
against Meany for lying to the FBI. Goodlett, who pleaded guilty to
federal charges, is expected to testify against them at their trials. A
fourth former officer, Brett Hankison, also faces a retrial for federal
charges in October.

Taylor's family said prosecutors plan to appeal this week's ruling.
"Obviously we are devastated," the family wrote in [a
statement](https://apnews.com/article/breonna-taylor-police-boyfriend-a7ff7c9b48307dd6423e9e999c667405?utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter)
to the Associated Press. "The only thing we can do at this point is
continue to be patient...we will continue to fight until we get full
justice for Breonna Taylor."

however, is not an excessive force case. To the contrary, the Government
expressly noted that "\[t\]he two officers who immediately returned fire
through Ms. Taylor's front door----including the officer who fired the
round that killed Ms. Taylor----have not been charged with any crime."81

2\. Proximate Cause

Requiring a proximate cause showing also comports with the purpose of §
242's death-results penalty. Two decisions from the Sixth Circuit: U.S
v. Martinez82 and U.S. v. Jeffries83 support this conclusion. Together,
Martinez and Jeffries stand for this proposition: requiring proximate
cause makes sense where a death-results penalty enhancement is tied to
an underlying offense which may be committed in many ways, some of which
carry an inherently foreseeable risk of death and others which do not.
Where death is inherently foreseeable, there is little point in
requiring proof of proximate cause, according to the Sixth Circuit.84
However, the same is not true when the penalty enhancement is tied to a
crime that may be committed in a way that does not necessarily hazard
someone's life. In such cases, proof of proximate cause makes sense:

In circumstances in which the potential for injury or death is not an
inherently foreseeable result of the conduct proscribed . . . , it might
make sense to require the government to prove that it was reasonably
foreseeable to the defendant that the conduct would be likely to lead to
injury or death, see Martinez, 588 F.3d at 319, and that the prohibited
conduct was the proximate cause of the injury or death.85

Thus, in the context of healthcare fraud, to convict the defendant of
causing a death, the Government must prove that the fraud was the
proximate cause (the Martinez holding).86 By

defendant.").\

#: 924

contrast, in a drug case where the enhanced penalty is tied to the use
of the narcotic, proximate cause is not required (the Jeffries
holding).87

Given this reasoning, requiring proximate cause with respect to § 242's
death-results penalty enhancement makes sense. "\[I\]n lieu of
describing the specific conduct it forbids, \[§ 242's\] general terms
incorporate constitutional law by reference, and many of the
incorporated constitutional guarantees are, of course, themselves stated
with some catholicity of phrasing."88 Thus, § 242 does not "delineate
the range of forbidden conduct with particularity."89 Indeed, as
explained, it is possible to commit the base offense -- a
rights-violation, including a constitutional rights violation -- without
violent means or causing bodily injury or death. That is, one can
violate another's constitutional rights without creating the risk that
someone may die. Thus, death is not an inherently foreseeable result of
violating § 242. In such cases, according to the Sixth Circuit's
decision in Jeffries, a proximate cause showing makes sense. The Fifth
Circuit reached the same conclusion about § 242:

Can it be seriously argued that a police officer, determined only to
extract a confession from a prisoner, who inflicts a fatal wound in the
persuasion process, has not committed the type of offense which Section
242 was designed to proscribe? Conversely, can it be seriously argued
that a police officer who illegally arrests a person who, on the way to
the paddy wagon, is killed by a bolt of lightning has committed the type
of offense which the amendment to Section 242 was designed to deter? We
think not. Rather, the more severe punishment prescribed for those
Section 242 violations resulting in death is clearly designed to deter
the type of conduct that creates an unacceptable risk of loss of life.90

This Court agrees. Section 242's harshest penalties -- life imprisonment
or a death sentence -- are meant to deter conduct that "creates an
unacceptable risk of loss of life."91 Not all police conduct

87 Id. at 524 ("Because death or injury from the use of the substance is
inherently foreseeable, . . . . \[i\]t therefore makes sense to require
the government to prove only but-for causation in order to apply the
enhanced penalty.").\

-- even conduct that violates a constitutional right -- inherently
creates such a risk. True, some wrongful police conduct carries an
inherently foreseeable risk of death (beating an arrestee to a pulp),
but some does not (wrongly impounding a car). Indeed, an officer should
not expect to be fired upon while booting a car much less expect that he
cannot return fire without risking life imprisonment or a death
sentence. Yet, if § 242 were to demand only but-for causation, such
would be the case as but-for wrongly impounding the car, a firefight
would not have broken out. There would be no consideration for whether
the shooter's conduct was the proximate cause of any harm that resulted
from the return fire.

Nonetheless, the Government argues that it need only prove actual cause
under § 242, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Burrage92 and
the Sixth Circuit's decision in Jeffries.93 Neither case requires that
conclusion. Burrage and Jeffries both concerned 21 U.S.C. § 841. In
Burrage, the Supreme Court did not reach a decision as to whether § 841
requires proximate cause. While Jeffries did reach the issue and held
only actual cause is required in § 841 cases, for the reasons explained
earlier, Jeffries still warrants the conclusion that § 242 requires
proximate cause proof. Again, unlike § 841 cases, violations of § 242
present "circumstances in which the potential for injury or death is not
an inherently foreseeable result of the conduct proscribed,"94 such that
proximate cause proof is warranted. This conclusion not only comports
with § 242's aims but also with the "fundamental principle of criminal
law that a person is held responsible for all consequences proximately
caused by his criminal conduct."95

Having found that proximate cause is required, the Court now turns to
its conclusion that the charged Fourth Amendment violation was not the
proximate cause of Taylor's death. The basis of

that alleged rights-violation is a lack of probable cause to enter
Taylor's apartment. More specifically, the Indictment alleges that
Jaynes and Meany each knew that the warrant affidavit, and by
commonsense implication, the warrant, "was not supported by probable
cause."96 The Indictment does not allege that Taylor's Fourth Amendment
rights were violated for any other reason. Thus, to state a case for the
death-results penalty enhancement, the Government must allege facts
which, if true, would permit the conclusion that Taylor's death was the
natural and probable consequence of the lack of probable cause to enter
her apartment. It has not done so.

"Every event has many causes . . . and only some of them are proximate,
as the law uses that term. So to say that one event was a proximate
cause of another means that it was not just any cause, but one with a
sufficient connection to the result."97 There "must be 'some direct
relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct
alleged.'"98 At the same time, proximate cause "is often explicated in
terms of foreseeability or the scope of the risk created by the
predicate conduct."99 Taken together, foreseeability and directness
overlap because in "most cases the more directly related an outcome is
to an underlying action, the more likely that the outcome will have been
foreseeable, and vice versa.'"100 Accordingly, an alleged harm is not
"foreseeable" simply because it is a conceivable consequence of some
action. Instead, it must be "the natural and probable consequence" of
the action at issue.101

In the context of constitutional rights, foreseeability/scope-of-risk is
defined by the interest that the constitutional right is meant to
protect.102 Here, again, the facts in this case implicate two

sets of interests: (1) those protected by the warrant requirement and
(2) those protected by the knock-and-announce rule. The warrant
requirement protects "privacy interests."103 It assures citizens that a
search is not an arbitrary, random act by government, "that the
intrusion is authorized by law," is narrow in scope, and is supported by
a judge's "objective determination" as to cause.104 By contrast, the
knock-and-announce rule is meant to protect "life and limb, because an
unannounced entry may provoke violence in supposed self-defense by the
surprised resident."105 The interests are different.106 Indeed, the risk
created by the failure to knock and announce has "nothing to do with
whether the Fourth Amendment require\[s\] the officers to obtain a
warrant."107 Accordingly, while Taylor's death is within the scope of
risk created by the failure to knock and announce, it is not within the
scope of risk created by the warrantless entry, i.e., by the fact that
the officers lacked probable cause to enter. This is the rub for the
Government.

The Government has not explained how the lack of probable cause to enter
created a foreseeable risk of a gunfire exchange. The Government does
not explain how the gunfire was the

natural and probable consequence of lacking a valid warrant. Instead,
the Government argues that the gunfire exchange was a foreseeable result
of the late-night, surprise manner of entry:

. . . the firefight that killed Ms. Taylor was a foreseeable result of
sending armed officers to execute an ill-gotten warrant on an
unsuspecting household late at night.108

. . . The execution of this warrant foreseeably resulted in a gunfight
when an unsuspecting resident (K.W.) fired a shot in self-defense at the
moment officers broke down Ms. Taylor's door.109

. . . if the trial evidence proves that K.W. lawfully fired to defend
Ms. Taylor's home because he and Ms. Taylor believed (honestly, but
mistakenly) that the police were intruders, Ms. Taylor's death would be
a foreseeable consequence of the defendants' obtaining a false warrant
that they knew would be served by armed officers at night on
unsuspecting people.110

. . . The government intends to prove . . . that the defendants . . .
knew that heavily armed officers would execute that ill-gotten warrant
at Ms. Taylor's home late at night . . . .111

The key here is the "late night" surprise, according to the Government.
That manner of executing the warrant created the risk of death, not the
lack of a valid warrant. The Government's argument fails to recognize
the distinction, conflating manner-of-entry issues with invalid entries.
As such, its argument is untenable. Indeed, Cnty. of Los Angeles v.
Mendez, a Supreme Court decision, instructs that such conflated
reasoning misses the mark and constitutes reversible error:

The \[appellate\] court reasoned that when officers make a "startling
entry" by "barging into" a home "unannounced," it is reasonably
foreseeable that violence may result. But this appears to focus solely
on the risks foreseeably associated with the failure to knock and
announce, which could not serve as the basis for liability since . . .
the officers had qualified immunity on that claim. By contrast, the
Court of Appeals did not identify the foreseeable risks associated with
the relevant constitutional violation (the warrantless entry); nor did
it explain how, on these facts, respondents' injuries were proximately
caused by the warrantless entry. In other words, the Court of Appeals'
proximate cause analysis . . . conflated distinct Fourth

Amendment claims and required only a murky causal link between the
warrantless entry and the injuries attributed to it.112

Here, the only alleged constitutional violation is a warrantless entry.
Yet there are no fact allegations which suggest that Taylor's death was
proximately caused by that entry. Nor has the Government explained how,
based on the alleged facts, Taylor's death was proximately caused by the
lack of probable cause to enter. Instead, the fact allegations and the
Government's argument compel the conclusion that Taylor's death was
proximately caused by the manner in which the warrant was executed.
K.W.'s decision to open fire, as alleged and argued, was the natural and
probable consequence of executing the warrant at 12:45 a.m. on "an
unsuspecting household." That decision prompted the return fire which
hit and killed Taylor.113

3\. Superseding Cause

Even if the warrantless entry were deemed the actual and proximate cause
of Taylor's death, the Court would still dismiss the Death-Results
Charge. While the Indictment alleges that Jaynes and Meany set off a
series of events that ended in Taylor's death, it also alleges that K.W.
disrupted those events when he decided to open fire on the Execution
Team: "When those officers broke down the door to the apartment, a guest
in Taylor's home (K.W.), believing that intruders were breaking in,
immediately fired one shot . . . ."114 Given this allegation, this case
presents a broken chain of events. There is no direct link between the
warrantless entry and Taylor's death. As a result, the issue becomes
whether the law deems K.W.'s decision to shoot first to supersede the
warrantless entry such that his conduct became the proximate, or legal,
cause of Taylor's death. The Court concludes K.W.'s decision to shoot
first did just that.

The Sixth Circuit's decision in Estate of Sowards v. City of Trenton115
supports this conclusion. In Sowards, a § 1983 case, police broke down
Sowards' door without probable cause, consent or exigent circumstance --
a warrantless entry. After police kicked in the door, they saw Sowards
pointing a gun at them and opened fire. Sowards was undeterred and
police fired again from a covered position. Sowards died from gunshot
wounds. Prior to that, in response to an officer's knocking on his door,
Sowards began yelling profanities and slipped a note under his door
suggesting that the officer was the devil. Thus, it is unclear if
Sowards, a schizophrenic, knew he was pointing his gun at police. The
district court held that the illegal entry was not the proximate cause
of the shooting; rather it was Sowards' threatening officers with a gun.
The Sixth Circuit affirmed: "Sowards' own conduct of pointing the
handgun toward the officers was the intervening or superseding cause
that set in motion the events that ultimately led to his death."116

Bodine v. Warwick,117 on which Sowards relied, is also instructive.
Bodine held that a warrantless entry does not automatically expose the
offending officers to liability for bodily harm caused by the officers'
subsequent use of force. Rather, if a subject threatens an officer who
responds with reasonable force, the officer cannot be liable for any
bodily harm because the subject's conduct would constitute a superseding
cause.118 The dispositive factor is the reasonableness of the officer's
conduct. Later, in Lamont v. New Jersey, the Third Circuit said as much,
explaining that Bodine stands for this proposition: "as long as 'the
officer\['s\] use of force was reasonable given the plaintiff's acts,
then despite the illegal entry, the plaintiff's own conduct would be a
\[superseding\] cause that limited the officer\['s\] liability.'"119

The Government has a different view. It contends that the dispositive
factor is whether the shooter recognizes that he is confronting
police.120 The Government cites Kane v. Lewis,121 a Fourth Circuit §
1983 case based on a failure to knock and announce theory. However, Kane
ultimately does not help the Government. In Kane, the police encounter
resulted in the death of Andrew Cornish, plaintiff Kane's father. After
police entered Cornish's home, he advanced toward them with a knife. The
Fourth Circuit found that given the logistics, Cornish must have known
he faced police but chose to advance on them anyway, making his attack
the superseding cause of his death.122 At the same time, the court put
it this way: "In other words, the Officers' illegal entry was not the
legal cause of Cornish's death; rather he was 'killed as a direct result
of trying to stab a police officer.'"123 That is, Cornish's death was
the natural and probable consequence of his attempt to stab a police
officer, an intervening act which bore the most direct relationship to
Cornish's death.124 Thus, Cornish's own conduct superseded the illegal
entry and became the legal cause of his death. This conclusion
epitomizes proximate and superseding cause analysis.

This reasoning also comports with the Restatement (Third)'s definition
of superseding cause. The Restatement states that a "'superseding cause'
is an intervening force or act that is deemed sufficient to prevent
liability for an actor whose tortious conduct was a factual cause of
harm. The 'act' may be tortious or entirely innocent."125 That is,
superseding-cause analysis does not turn on the culpability of the
intervening actor. Rather, it turns on what conduct bears the most

break the causal chain because it is foreseeable.") (emphasis in

Smallwood v. State

 

TW: Sexual Assault

 

### *Smallwood v. State*

Maryland Court of Appeals

680 A.2d 512 (App. Md.1996)

 

MURPHY, Chief Judge.

On August 29, 1991, Dwight Ralph Smallwood was diagnosed as being
infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). According to
medical records from the Prince George\'s County Detention Center, he
had been informed of his HIV-positive status by September 25, 1991. In
February 1992, a social worker made Smallwood aware of the necessity of
practicing \"safe sex\" in order to avoid transmitting the virus to his
sexual partners, and in July 1993, Smallwood told health care providers
at Children\'s Hospital that he had only one sexual partner and that
they always used condoms. Smallwood again tested positive for HIV in
February and March of 1994.

On September 26, 1993, Smallwood and an accomplice robbed a woman at
gunpoint, and forced her into a grove of trees where each man
alternately placed a gun to her head while the other one raped her. On
September 28, 1993, Smallwood and an accomplice robbed a second woman at
gunpoint and took her to a secluded location, where Smallwood inserted
his penis into her with \"slight penetration.\" On September 30, 1993,
Smallwood and an accomplice robbed yet a third woman, also at gunpoint,
and took her to a local school where she was forced to perform oral sex
on Smallwood and was raped by him. In each of these episodes, Smallwood
threatened to kill his victims if they did not cooperate or to return
and shoot them if they reported his crimes. Smallwood did not wear a
condom during any of these criminal episodes.

Based upon his attack on September 28, 1993, Smallwood was charged with,
among other crimes, attempted first-degree rape, robbery with a deadly
weapon, assault with intent to murder, and reckless endangerment. In
separate indictments, Smallwood was also charged with the attempted
second degree murder of each of his three victims. On October 11, 1994,
Smallwood pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Prince George\'s County
to attempted first-degree rape and robbery with a deadly weapon. The
circuit court also convicted Smallwood of assault with intent to murder
and reckless endangerment based upon his September 28, 1993 attack, and
convicted Smallwood of all three counts of attempted second-degree
murder.

Following his conviction, Smallwood was sentenced to concurrent
sentences of life imprisonment for attempted rape, twenty years
imprisonment for robbery with a deadly weapon, thirty years imprisonment
for assault with intent to murder, and five years imprisonment for
reckless endangerment. The circuit court also imposed a concurrent
thirty-year sentence for each of the three counts of attempted
second-degree murder. The circuit court\'s judgments were affirmed in
part and reversed in part by the Court of Special Appeals. In *Smallwood
v. State*, 106 Md.App. 1, 661 A.2d 747 (1995), the intermediate
appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient for the trial
court to conclude that Smallwood intended to kill his victims and upheld
all of his convictions.\[2\] Upon Smallwood\'s petition, we granted
certiorari to consider whether the trial court could properly conclude
that Smallwood possessed the requisite intent to support his convictions
of attempted second-degree murder and assault with intent to murder.

Smallwood asserts that the trial court lacked sufficient evidence to
support its conclusion that Smallwood intended to kill his three
victims. Smallwood argues that the fact that he engaged in unprotected
sexual intercourse, even though he knew that he carried HIV, is
insufficient to infer an intent to kill. The most that can reasonably be
inferred, Smallwood contends, is that he is guilty of recklessly
endangering his victims by exposing them to the risk that they would
become infected themselves. The State disagrees, arguing that the facts
of this case are sufficient to infer an intent to kill. The State likens
Smallwood\'s HIV-positive status to a deadly weapon and argues that
engaging in unprotected sex when one is knowingly infected with HIV is
equivalent to firing a loaded firearm at that person.

As we have previously stated, \"\[t\]he required intent in the crimes of
assault with intent to murder and attempted murder is the specific
intent to murder, i.e., the specific intent to kill under circumstances
that would not legally justify or excuse the killing or mitigate it to
manslaughter.\" Smallwood has not argued that his actions were performed
under mitigating circumstances or that he was legally justified in
attacking the three women. He was properly found guilty of attempted
murder and assault with intent to murder only if there was sufficient
evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably have concluded
that Smallwood possessed a specific intent to kill at the time he
assaulted each of the three women.

An intent to kill may be proved by circumstantial evidence. \"\[S\]ince
intent is subjective and, without the cooperation of the accused, cannot
be directly and objectively proven, its presence must be shown by
established facts which permit a proper inference of its existence.
Therefore, the trier of fact may infer the existence of the required
intent from surrounding circumstances such as \"the accused\'s acts,
conduct and words.\" As we have repeatedly stated, \"under the proper
circumstances, an intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a
deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body.\"

In *Raines*, 606 A.2d 265 (Md.,1992) we upheld the use of such an
inference. In that case, Raines and a friend were traveling on a highway
when the defendant fired a pistol into the driver\'s side window of a
tractor trailer in an adjacent lane. The shot killed the driver of the
tractor trailer, and Raines was convicted of first degree murder. The
evidence in the case showed that Raines shot at the driver\'s window of
the truck, knowing that the truck driver was immediately behind the
window. We concluded that \"Raines\'s actions in directing the gun at
the window, and therefore at the driver\'s head on the other side of the
window, permitted an inference that Raines shot the gun with the intent
to kill.\"

The State argues that our analysis in Raines rested upon two elements:
(1) Raines knew that his weapon was deadly, and (2) Raines knew that he
was firing it at someone\'s head. The State argues that Smallwood
similarly knew that HIV infection ultimately leads to death, and that he
knew that he would be exposing his victims to the risk of HIV
transmission by engaging in unprotected sex with them. Therefore, the
State argues, a permissible inference can be drawn that Smallwood
intended to kill each of his three victims. The State\'s analysis,
however, ignores several factors.

First, we must consider the magnitude of the risk to which the victim is
knowingly exposed. The inference drawn in *Raines*, supra, rests upon
the rule that \"\[i\]t is permissible to infer that \'one intends the
natural and probable consequences of his act.\'\" Before an intent to
kill may be inferred based solely upon the defendant\'s exposure of a
victim to a risk of death, it must be shown that the victim\'s death
would have been a natural and probable result of the defendant\'s
conduct. It is for this reason that a trier of fact may infer that a
defendant possessed an intent to kill when firing a deadly weapon at a
vital part of the human body. When a deadly weapon has been fired at a
vital part of a victim\'s body, the risk of killing the victim is so
high that it becomes reasonable to assume that the defendant intended
the victim to die as a natural and probable consequence of the
defendant\'s actions.

Death by AIDS is clearly one natural possible consequence of exposing
someone to a risk of HIV infection, even on a single occasion. It is
less clear that death by AIDS from that single exposure is a
sufficiently probable result to provide the sole support for an
inference that the person causing the exposure intended to kill the
person who was exposed. While the risk to which Smallwood exposed his
victims when he forced them to engage in unprotected sexual activity
must not be minimized, the State has presented no evidence from which it
can reasonably be concluded that death by AIDS is a probable result of
Smallwood\'s actions to the same extent that death is the probable
result of firing a deadly weapon at a vital part of someone\'s body.
Without such evidence, it cannot fairly be concluded that death by AIDS
was sufficiently probable to support an inference that Smallwood
intended to kill his victims in the absence of other evidence indicative
of an intent to kill.

In this case, we find no additional evidence from which to infer an
intent to kill. Smallwood\'s actions are wholly explained by an intent
to commit rape and armed robbery, the crimes for which he has already
pled guilty. For this reason, his actions fail to provide evidence that
he also had an intent to kill. As one commentator noted, in discussing a
criminal case involving similar circumstances, \"\[b\]ecause virus
transmission occurs simultaneously with the act of rape, that act alone
would not provide evidence of intent to transmit the virus. Some
additional evidence, such as an explicit statement, would be necessary
to demonstrate the actor\'s specific intent.\" Smallwood\'s knowledge of
his HIV-infected status provides the only evidence in this case
supporting a conclusion that he intended anything beyond the rapes and
robberies for which he has been convicted.

The cases cited by the State demonstrate the sort of additional evidence
needed to support an inference that Smallwood intended to kill his
victims. The defendants in these cases have either made explicit
statements demonstrating an intent to infect their victims or have taken
specific actions demonstrating such an intent and tending to exclude
other possible intents. In *State v. Hinkhouse*, 139 Or.App. 446 (1996),
for example, the defendant engaged in unprotected sex with a number of
women while knowing that he was HIV positive. The defendant had also
actively concealed his HIV-positive status from these women, had lied to
several of them by stating that he was not HIV-positive, and had refused
the women\'s requests that he wear condoms. There was also evidence that
he had told at least one of his sexual partners that \"if he were
\[HIV-\] positive, he would spread the virus to other people.\" The
Oregon Court of Appeals found this evidence to be sufficient to
demonstrate an intent to kill, and upheld the defendant\'s convictions
for attempted murder.

In *State v. Caine*, 652 So.2d 611 (La.App.), cert. denied, 661 So.2d
1358 (La.1995), a conviction for attempted second degree murder was
upheld where the defendant had jabbed a used syringe into a victim\'s
arm while shouting \"I\'ll give you AIDS.\" The defendant in *Weeks v.
State*, 834 S.W.2d 559 (Tex.App.1992), made similar statements, and was
convicted of attempted murder after he spat on a prison guard. In that
case, the defendant knew that he was HIV-positive, and the appellate
court found that \"the record reflects that \[Weeks\] thought he could
kill the guard by spitting his HIV-infected saliva at him.\" *Id.* at
562. There was also evidence that at the time of the spitting incident,
Weeks had stated that he was \"going to take someone with him when he
went,\' that he was \`medical now,\' and that he was \'HIV-4.\'\"

The evidence in *State v. Haines*, 545 N.E.2d 834 (Ind.App.1989),
contained both statements by the defendant demonstrating intent and
actions solely explainable as attempts to spread HIV. There, the
defendant\'s convictions for attempted murder were upheld where the
defendant slashed his wrists and sprayed blood from them on a police
officer and two paramedics, splashing blood in their faces and eyes. Id.
at 835. Haines attempted to scratch and bite them and attempted to force
blood-soaked objects into their faces. During this altercation, the
defendant told the officer that he should be left to die because he had
AIDS, that he wanted to \"give it to him,\" and that he would \"use his
wounds\" to spray the officer with blood. Id. Haines also \"repeatedly
yelled that he had AIDS, that he could not deal with it and that he was
going to make \[the officer\] deal with it.\" Id.

*Scroggins v. State*, 198 Ga.App. 29, 401 S.E.2d 13, 15 (1990), presents
a similar scenario, where the defendant made noises with his mouth as if
bringing up spittle and then bit a police officer hard enough to break
the skin. Immediately after this incident he informed a nurse that he
was HIV-positive and laughed when the police officer asked him if he had
AIDS. The Georgia Court of Appeals found that evidence showing that the
defendant \"sucked up excess sputum\" before biting the officer was
\"evidence of a deliberate, thinking act\" and that in conjunction with
the defendant\'s laughter when asked about AIDS, it provided sufficient
evidence of intent to support Scroggins\'s conviction for assault with
intent to kill.

In contrast with these cases, the State in this case would allow the
trier of fact to infer an intent to kill based solely upon the fact that
Smallwood exposed his victims to the risk that they might contract HIV.
Without evidence showing that such a result is sufficiently probable to
support this inference, we conclude that Smallwood\'s convictions for
attempted murder and assault with intent to murder must be reversed.

People v. Rizzo

 

### *People v. Rizzo*

New York Court of Appeals

158 N.E. 888 (N.Y. 1927)

 

CRANE, J.

The police of the city of New York did excellent work in this case by
preventing the commission of a serious crime. It is a great satisfaction
to realize that we have such wide­-awake guardians of our peace. Whether
or not the steps which the defendant had taken up to the time of his
arrest amounted to the commission of at crime, as defined by our law,
is, however, another matter. He has been convicted of an attempt to
commit the crime of robbery in the first degree and sentenced to State's
prison. There is no doubt that he had the intention to commit robbery if
he got the chance. An examination, however, of the facts is necessary to
determine whether his acts were in preparation to commit the crime if
the opportunity offered, or constituted a crime in itself, known to our
law as an attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. Charles Rizzo,
the defendant, appellant, with three others, Anthony Dorio, Thomas Milo
and John Thomasello, on January 14th planned to rob one Charles Rao of a
payroll valued at about \$31,200 which he was to carry from the bank for
the United Lathing Company. These defendants, two of whom had firearms,
started out in an automobile, looking for Rao or the man who had the
payroll on that day. Rizzo claimed to be able to identify the man and
was to point him out to the others who were to do the actual holding up.
The four rode about in their car looking for Rao. They went to the bank
from which he was supposed to get the money and to various buildings
being constructed by the United Lathing Company. At last they came to
One Hundred and Eightieth street and Morris Park avenue. By this time
they were watched and followed by two police officers. As Rizzo jumped
out of the car and ran into the building all- four were arrested. The
defendant was taken out from the building in which he was hiding.
Neither Rao nor a man named Previti, who was also supposed to carry a
payroll, were at the place at the time of the arrest. The defendants had
not found or seen the man they intended to rob; no person with a payroll
was at any of the places where they had stopped no one had been pointed
out or identified by Rizzo. The four men intended to rob the payroll
man, whoever he was; they were looking for him, but they had not seen or
discovered him up to the time they were arrested.

Does this constitute the crime of an attempt to commit robbery in the
first degree? The Penal Law, section 2, prescribes: An act, done with
intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its
commission, is \"an attempt to commit that crime\". The word tending is
very indefinite. It is perfectly evident that there will arise
differences of opinion as to whether an act in a given case is one
tending. to commit a crime. Tending means to exert activity in a
particular direction. Any act in preparation to commit a crime may be
said to have a tendency towards its accomplishment. The procuring of the
automobile, searching the streets looking for the desired victim, were
in reality acts tending toward the commission of the proposed crime. The
law, however, has recognized that many acts in the way of preparation
are too remote to constitute the crime of attempt. The line has been
drawn between those acts which are remote and those which are proximate
and near to the consummation. The law must be practical, and, therefore,
considers those acts only as tending to the commission of the crime
which are so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable
probability the crime itself would, have been committed but for timely
interference. The cases which have been before the courts express this
idea in different language, but the idea remains the same. The act or
acts must come or advance very near to the accomplishment of the
intended crime. In *People v. Mills* (178 N. Y. 274) it was said:
"Felonious intent alone is not enough, but there must be an overt act
shown in order to establish even an attempt. An overt act is one done to
carry out the intention, and it must be such as would naturally effect
that result, unless prevented by some extraneous cause." In *Hyde V. U.
S.* (225 U.S. 347) it was stated that the act amounts to an attempt when
it is so near to the result that the danger, of success is very great.
There must be dangerous proximity to success."

The method of committing or attempting crime varies in each case so that
the difficulty, if any, is not with this rule of law regarding an
attempt, which is well understood, but with its application to the
facts.

How shall we apply this rule of immediate nearness to this case? The
defendants were looking for the payroll man to rob him of his money.
This is the charge in the indictment. Robbery is defined in section 2120
of the Penal Law as the unlawful taking of personal property, from the
person or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of
force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his
person; and it is made robbery in the first degree by section 2124 when
committed by a person aided by accomplices actually present. To
constitute the crime of robbery the money must have been taken from Rao
by means of force or violence, or through fear. The crime of attempt to
commit robbery was committed if these defendants did any act tending to
the commission of this robbery. Did the acts above describe come
dangerously near to the taking of Rao's property? Did the acts come so
near the commission of robbery that there was reasonable likelihood of
its accomplishment but for the interference? Rao was not found the
defendants were still looking for him; no attempt to rob him could be
made, at least until he came in sight; he was not in the building at One
Hundred and Eightieth street and Morris Park Avenue. There was no man
there with the payroll for the United Lathing Company whom these
defendants could rob. Apparently, no money had been drawn from the bank
for the payroll by anybody at the time of the arrest. In a word, these
defendants had planned to commit a crime and were looking around the
city for an opportunity to commit it, but the opportunity fortunately
never came. Men would not be guilty of an attempt at burglary if they
had planned to break into a building and were arrested while they were
hunting about the streets for the building not knowing where it was.
Neither would a man be guilty of an attempt to commit murder if he armed
himself and started out to find the person whom he had planned to kill
but could not him. So here these defendants were not guilty of an
attempt to commit robbery in the first degree when they had not found or
reached the presence of the person they intended to rob.

For these reasons, the judgment of conviction of this defendant,
appellant, must be reversed and a new trial granted.

If sheer volume of literature be the measure of fascination, then few
subjects have been as intriguing for criminal law scholars as the nexus
between the doctrine of impossibility and the crime of
attempt.[**^1^**](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/266/#footnote_1_1) Perhaps
this is so because that subject raises issues that are central to the

to [*\*267*](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/266/#p267)consider the
application of the concepts

A police undercover sting operation culminated in the indictment of
defendant Kerry Vann Bell for attempted rape of a child and solicitation
of sexual conduct for a fee . . . The defendant moved to dismiss the
charges, claiming there was insufficient evidence presented to the grand
jury. . .

*Background. *The evidence before the grand jury can be summarized as
follows. On March 25, 2004, Officer Patricia Cummings was assigned to
pose as a prostitute willing to sell the sexual favors of a five year
old child. Using a false name, Cummings called the defendant's cellular
telephone number, which was provided to her by a confidential informant,
and asked for a man named "Ron." "Ron," who turned out to be the
defendant, answered the telephone and acknowledged that a mutual friend
(the confidential informant) had told him that Cummings was "cool."
After both parties verified that they were not recording the call,
Cummings asked to meet the defendant in person at a convenience store in
Worcester, and the defendant agreed. The defendant, however, would not
describe his appearance or the car he would be driving. He asked
Cummings for her description and said that he would find her. The
defendant also asked her to bring the child with her; otherwise, he
said, they did not need to meet. Cummings, unable to bring the
nonexistent child, told the defendant that the child would be close to
the meeting point, and the defendant agreed to meet.

. . .The defendant arrived, approached Cummings's car, and said, "I
found you." The defendant answered to the name "Ron." Cummings exited
her car and walked with the defendant to the store. After questioning
each other on whether either was a police officer or was wearing a wire,
the defendant began to complain that Cummings had not brought the child.
Eventually, Cummings told the defendant that the child was "over by" a
nearby park.

Cummings and the defendant then walked to a black sport utility vehicle
(SUV) (which the defendant had driven to the site), where they discussed
the transaction in detail. First, the defendant entered the vehicle and
moved some items around inside to show that he was not a police officer.
Then he told Cummings to get in. Inside the vehicle, the defendant told
Cummings that he "doesn't. . . \[often\] do this and that he had a lot
at stake, that he was a professional," and that "\[o\]ther people that
do this don't have much at stake." Cummings replied that she did not
want this "to get back" to her and that she did not want the child hurt.
The defendant asked if the child was "stretched," to which Cummings
replied that the child had been. The defendant also asked the child's
age. When Cummings answered that she was almost five, the defendant
said, "\[t\]hat is a good age because they're not in school yet where no
one has to report anything." The defendant also said that he had "done
boys before, but prefers girls," and that he had "done ages from three
to five, six." Cummings responded to other questions from the defendant,
explaining that the child was "withdrawn" and that she "doesn't say
much, kind of does what you say." Cummings warned the defendant that she
did not want the child hurt, and the defendant responded that he wanted
intercourse and that he had done this before. The defendant asked
Cummings about her "place that was nearby," and whether she felt better
about the arrangement now, after her initial hesitation. He again asked
where the child was. Cummings replied that the child was at "Elm Street
by Elm Park." They then agreed that the defendant would follow Cummings
to the location. When Cummings told the defendant she would not take
anything less than \$200, he looked at her and nodded "yes." Cummings
then left the SUV, walked toward her car, and signaled other officers,
who arrested the defendant. During booking, \$211 were found in the
defendant's possession.

*Discussion. * . . . \[Does\] the indictment alleging an attempt to
commit rape of a child in this case is supported, as matter of law, by
sufficient evidence of an overt act to survive a motion to dismiss.. . .
The offense of criminal attempt, G. L. c. 274, § 6, requires proof of
both "a specific intent to commit the substantive offense . . . and \...
an overt act towards its commission." *Commonwealth *v. *Foley, *[24
Mass. App. Ct. 114](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/24/114/#p115), 115
(1987). The overt act alleged "must approach the achievement of
the substantive crime attempted near enough to warrant criminal
liability in view of such circumstances as the gravity of the crime, the
uncertainty of the result, and the seriousness of any threatened
danger." *. . .*While "preparation is not an attempt \...\[,\] some
preparations may amount to an attempt." . . . "If the preparation comes
very near to the accomplishment of the act, the intent to complete it
renders the crime so probable that the act will be a misdemeanor
although there is still a *locus penitentiae *\[opportunity to
withdraw\] in the need of a further exertion of the will to complete the
crime. . . . \[T\]he degree of proximity held sufficient may vary with
circumstances, including among other things the apprehension which the
particular crime is calculated to excite." 

Here, we have just such a combination of factors. The record before the
grand jury showed that the defendant received a telephone call from a
woman who he thought was offering a child to him in an exchange of
sexual services for money. He agreed to meet that woman for the express
purpose of effectuating that exchange. The defendant met the woman;
expressed disappointment that she had not brought the child with her as
he thought she had agreed to do; discussed with her the temperament and
physical condition of the child, the location of the child, and the
woman's experience in this type of activity; and agreed to the amount of
the charge (not less than \$200). When the police arrested him, the
defendant was about to follow the woman to the child for the purpose of
having intercourse with the child in a nearby location. The defendant
had just over \$200 in his possession when he was arrested. These
alleged actions and the evidence, in context and taken together, show
both a detailed plan and an agreement to commit the rape. All that was
left to do was to drive to a nearby location and get the child. A
present intention to perform the crime coupled with a well thought out
plan and a commitment to complete it weighs heavily towards the
certainty that the commission of the crime was imminent. In addition,
"the gravity of the crime . . . and the seriousness of any threatened
danger" cannot be gainsaid. *Commonwealth *v. *Foley, *[24 Mass. App.
Ct. at 115](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/24/114/#p115). In sum,
considering the relatively small gap between the defendant's completed
actions and consummation of the contemplated rape, the defendant's
commitment to a detailed plan, and the gravity of the offense, we
conclude that there was sufficient evidence of an overt act to survive a
motion to dismiss the indictment.

The defendant
cites *Commonwealth *v. *Ortiz, [supra,](https://cite.case.law/mass/408/463/#p471) *to
support his contention that because he might have had a change of heart
while traveling to the meeting, the evidence of his conduct was too
remote to constitute an overt act. Each case, however, must be decided
on its own facts. Here, there was substantial evidence alleged before
the grand jury that the defendant had a specific plan to which he was
apparently committed and was in the process of carrying out when he was
arrested. . .

All in all, given the nature of the crime alleged, the thoroughness of
the defendant's planning and his conduct as alleged, and the little that
remained for him to do to complete the crime, we conclude that the gap
here between what was done and what remained to be done was small enough
to warrant probable cause for a charge of attempt.

[**9**](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/266/#ref_footnote_1_9)

The doctrine of attempt in this Commonwealth is to be distinguished from
the position adopted by the Model Penal Code.
See *Commonwealth *v. *Hamel, [supra ](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/250/#p257)*[at
258-259](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/250/#p257). The Code
focuses on what the offender has done, not what he has left to do. It
looks to whether the defendant took "a 'substantial step in a course of
conduct planned to culminate in \[the\] commission of the crime,' which
step was 'strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.'
" [*Id. *at 258](https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/250/#p257),
quoting from Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 5.01(l)(c) & (2), at
296 (1985). Legislation reflecting this approach, which broadens the
base of criminal attempt and would make criminal convictions easier to
secure, was proposed \[in Massachusetts\] but not enacted.

McQuirter v. State

 

### *McQuirter v. State*

Court of Appeals of Alabama

63 So.2d 388 (1953)

 

PRICE, Judge.

Appellant, a Negro man, was found guilty of an attempt to commit an
assault with intent to rape, under an indictment charging an assault
with intent to rape. The jury assessed a fine of \$500.

About 8:00 o\'clock on the night of June 29, 1951, Mrs. Ted Allen, a
white woman, with her two children and a neighbor\'s little girl, were
drinking Coca-Cola at the \"Tiny Diner\" in Atmore. When they started in
the direction of Mrs. Allen\'s home she noticed appellant sitting in the
cab of a parked truck. As she passed the truck appellant said something
unintelligible, opened the truck door and placed his foot on the running
board.

Mrs. Allen testified appellant followed her down the street and when she
reached Suell Lufkin\'s house she stopped. As she turned into the Lufkin
house appellant was within two or three feet of her. She waited ten
minutes for appellant to pass. When she proceeded on her way, appellant
came toward her from behind a telephone pole. She told the children to
run to Mr. Simmons\' house and tell him to come and meet her. When
appellant saw Mr. Simmons he turned and went back down the street to the
intersection and leaned on a stop sign just across the street from Mrs.
Allen\'s home. Mrs. Allen watched him at the sign from Mr. Simmons\'
porch for about thirty minutes, after which time he came back down the
street and appellant went on home.

Mrs. Allen\'s testimony was corroborated by that of her young daughter.
The daughter testified the appellant was within six feet of her mother
as she approached the Lufkin house, and this witness said there was a
while when she didn\'t see appellant at the intersection.

Mr. Lewis Simmons testified when the little girls ran up on his porch
and said a Negro was after them, witness walked up the sidewalk to meet
Mrs. Allen and saw appellant. Appellant went on down the street and
stopped in front of Mrs. Allen\'s home and waited there approximately
thirty minutes.

Mr. Clarence Bryars, a policeman in Atmore, testified that appellant
stated after his arrest that he came to Atmore with the intention of
getting him a white woman that night.

Mr. W. E. Strickland, Chief of Police of Atmore, testified that
appellant stated in the Atmore jail he didn\'t know what was the matter
with him; that he was drinking a little; that he and his partner had
been to Pensacola; that his partner went to the \"Front\" to see a
colored woman; that he didn\'t have any money and he sat in the truck
and made up his mind he was going to get the first woman that came by
and that this was the first woman that came by. He said he got out of
the truck, came around the gas tank and watched the lady and when she
started off he started off behind her; that he was going to carry her in
the cotton patch and if she hollered he was going to kill her. He
testified appellant made the same statement in the Brewton jail.

Mr. Norvelle Seals, Chief Deputy Sheriff, corroborated Mr. Strickland\'s
testimony as to the statement by appellant at the Brewton jail.

Appellant, as a witness in his own behalf, testified he and Bill Page,
another Negro, carried a load of junk-iron from Monroeville to
Pensacola; on their way back to Monroeville they stopped in Atmore. They
parked the truck near the \"Tiny Diner\" and rode to the \"Front,\" the
colored section, in a cab. Appellant came back to the truck around 8:00
o\'clock and sat in the truck cab for about thirty minutes. He decided
to go back to the \"Front\" to look for Bill Page. As he started up the
street he saw prosecutrix and her children. He turned around and waited
until he decided they had gone, then he walked up the street toward the
\"Front.\" When he reached the intersection at the telegraph pole he
decided he didn\'t want to go to the \"Front\" and sat around there a
few minutes, then went on to the \"Front\" and stayed about 25 or 30
minutes, and came back to the truck.

He denied that he followed Mrs. Allen or made any gesture toward
molesting her or the children. He denied making the statements testified
to by the officers.

He testified he had never been arrested before and introduced testimony
by two residents of Monroeville as to his good reputation for peace and
quiet and for truth and veracity.

Appellant insists the trial court erred in refusing the general
affirmative charge and in denying the motion for a new trial on the
ground the verdict was contrary to the evidence.

\"\'An attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape,\' . . . means
an attempt to rape which has not proceeded far enough to amount to an
assault\". *Burton v. State*, 8 Ala.App. 295, 62 So. 394, 396.

Under the authorities in this state, to justify a conviction for an
attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to have
sexual intercourse with prosecutrix against her will, by force or by
putting her in fear.

Intent is a question to be determined by the jury from the facts and
circumstances adduced on the trial, and if there is evidence from which
it may be inferred that at the time of the attempt defendant intended to
gratify his lustful desires against the resistance of the female a jury
question is presented.

In determining the question of intention the jury may consider social
conditions and customs founded upon racial differences, such as that the
prosecutrix was a white woman and defendant was a Negro man.

After considering the evidence in this case we are of the opinion it was
sufficient to warrant the submission of the question of defendant\'s
guilt to the jury, and was ample to sustain the judgment of conviction.

Defense counsel contends in brief that the testimony of the officers as
to defendant\'s declarations of intent was inadmissible because no
attempt or overt act toward carrying that intent into effect had been
proven.

Defendant\'s grounds of objection to this evidence were that it was
\"irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial.\" Proper predicates were laid
for the introduction of each of said statements. In the absence of a
ground of objection calling the court\'s attention to the fact that the
corpus delicti has not been sufficiently proven to authorize admission
of a confession such question cannot be reviewed here.

Moreover, if any facts are proven from which the jury may reasonably
infer that the crime has been committed proof of the confession is
rendered admissible. We find no reversible error in the record and the
judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

Affirmed.

MPC Section 5.01

 

### Section 5.01. Criminal Attempt.

\(1\) Definition of Attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit
a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for
commission of the crime, he:

\(a\) purposely engages in conduct that would constitute the crime if
the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or

\(b\) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does
or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief
that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; or

\(c\) purposely does or omits to do anything that, under the
circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission
constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to
culminate in his commission of the crime.

\(2\) Conduct That May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection (1)(c).
Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under
Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of
the actor\'s criminal purpose. Without negativing the sufficiency of
other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor\'s
criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law:

\(a\) lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim
of the crime;

\(b\) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim ofthe crime
to go to the place contemplated for its commission;

\(c\) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the
crime;

\(d\) unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is
contemplated that the crime will be committed;

\(e\) possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the
crime, that are specially designed for such unlawful use or that can
serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;

 (f) possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed
in the commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for
its commission, if such possession, collection or fabrication serves no
lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;

\(g\) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an
element of the crime.

\(3\) Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime.

A person who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit a
crime that would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the
crime were committed by such other person, is guilty of an attempt to
commit the crime, although the crime is not committed or attempted by
such other person.

\(4\) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. When the actor\'s conduct would
otherwise constitute an attempt under Subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) of
this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort
to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under
circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his
criminal purpose. The establishment of such defense does not, however,
affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such
abandonment or prevention.

Within the meaning of this Article, renunciation of criminal purpose is
not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances,
not present or apparent at the inception of the actor\'s course of
conduct, that increase the probability of detection or apprehension or
that make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.
Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to
postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to
transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.

O\'Shaughnessy v. People

 

### *O'Shaughnessy v. People*

Colorado Supreme Court

269 P.3d 1233 (Colo. 2012)

 

Justice RICE delivered the Opinion of the Court.

**I. Introduction**

We granted certiorari in this case to review whether the court of
appeals imposed an unauthorized restriction on the affirmative defense
of abandonment when it held that a defendant was not entitled to a jury
instruction on abandonment when charged with attempted first degree
murder with a deadly weapon or with attempted aggravated robbery once
the defendant injured the victim. We hold that to present an affirmative
defense of abandonment of an attempt crime for jury consideration the
defendant must present "some credible evidence" on the issue. Further,
we hold that having injured the victim does not necessarily foreclose
the affirmative defense of abandonment. Nonetheless, we agree that here
the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative
defense of abandonment because the defendant failed to present
sufficient evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.

**II. Facts and Proceedings Below**

Uncontroverted evidence presented at trial showed that Geri David was
attacked in the parking lot of a grocery store on the morning of
September 13, 2004, by a man she later identified as Michael
O\'Shaughnessy. She was approached from behind by O\'Shaughnessy, who
was brandishing a six-inch hunting knife with a serrated blade. He held
the knife to her face and ordered her into her car. She sat in the
driver\'s seat with her feet outside of the car and kicked at her
assailant to ward off the attack. As she lashed out at him, he stabbed
her with the knife, causing injury to the right and left sides of her
neck and throat, to her left thigh, and to her hand.

At that point, O\'Shaughnessy said, "You\'re going to die," and demanded
her money. David told him she did not have any money and turned toward
the floor of the passenger seat to look for her purse. When she turned
back, O\'Shaughnessy was gone. He did not reach for or take the purse.

A jury convicted O\'Shaughnessy of attempted first degree murder with a
deadly weapon, attempted aggravated robbery, second degree assault,
false imprisonment, reckless endangerment, and a violent crime sentence
enhancement. . . .

We granted certiorari to determine whether the court of appeals imposed
an unauthorized restriction on the affirmative defense of abandonment.

**III. Analysis**

The issue before this Court is whether the court of appeals imposed an
unauthorized restriction on the affirmative defense of abandonment when
it held that a defendant is not entitled to a jury instruction on
abandonment when charged with attempted first degree murder with a
deadly weapon, or with attempted aggravated robbery, once the defendant
has injured the victim. We hold that a defendant must present "some
credible evidence" on the issue involving the claimed defense in order
to merit a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of abandonment
for criminal attempt. We additionally hold that evidence showing that
the defendant injured the victim does not necessarily foreclose the
defendant\'s ability to present the abandonment defense to the jury.
Nonetheless, we agree with the court of appeals\' conclusion that here
the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative
defense of abandonment because the defendant failed to present
sufficient evidence.

**A. Section 18--2--101---Attempt Crimes**

Under section 18--2--101(1), C.R.S. (2011), a person commits criminal
attempt if "he engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward
the commission of the offense." A substantial step is any conduct "which
is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor\'s purpose to
complete the commission of the offense." \[Note: this is the same as the
MPC formulation\]

The statute goes on to provide that a defendant may assert the
affirmative defense of abandonment to the crime of attempt when the
defendant "abandon\[s\] his effort to commit the crime or otherwise
prevent\[s\] its commission \... under circumstances manifesting the
complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal intent." 

Thus, under the statute, though the crime of attempt is complete once
the actor takes a substantial step toward the commission of the crime,
the affirmative defense of abandonment applies if the actor completely
and voluntarily renunciates his criminal intent thereafter.

This tension between completion by a substantial step and a subsequent
complete voluntary renunciation of criminal intent gives rise to the
issue before this Court. Though the abandonment defense "may apply at
various stages, early and late, in the commission of attempted crimes,"
it is not unlimited. Once the attempt has been completed by putting into
motion forces the actor can no longer stop, it cannot be abandoned. . . 

We now turn to whether the defense presented some credible evidence to
support an instruction on the affirmative defense of abandonment in the
case at hand. 

**1. Attempted Aggravated Robbery**

The criminal code provides that a person is guilty of aggravated robbery
if

. . . during the act of robbery or immediate flight therefrom . . . he
knowingly wounds or strikes the person robbed . . . with a deadly weapon
or by the use of force, threats, or intimidation with a deadly weapon
knowingly puts the person robbed . . . in reasonable fear of death or
bodily injury.

§ 18--4--302(1)(b), C.R.S. (2011). The requirement of the attempt
statute quoted above, section 18--2--101, must also be met to satisfy a
charge of attempted aggravated robbery.

Here, uncontroverted evidence showed that O\'Shaughnessy knowingly
struck and wounded David in the process of attempting to rob her. He
stabbed her six times with a hunting knife while demanding money. While
doing so, he used force, threats, and intimidation by telling her she
was "going to die," while wielding the knife.

Given these undisputed facts, O\'Shaughnessy failed to present some
credible evidence that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime under
circumstances manifesting the complete and voluntary renunciation of his
criminal intent. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court\'s
determination, as a matter of law, that O\'Shaughnessy did not raise an
affirmative defense of abandonment to the charge of attempted aggravated
robbery.

**2. Attempted First Degree Murder**

O\'Shaughnessy also asserts that he was entitled to a jury instruction
on the affirmative defense of abandonment with respect to the charge of
attempted first degree murder.

O\'Shaughnessy asserts that there was some evidence in the record that
he abandoned the attempt to murder David when he stopped the assault,
asked for money, and then walked away. To the contrary, the undisputed
evidence at trial is that in the course of thirty to sixty seconds the
assailant stabbed the victim six times, including four times in and near
the throat; verbally threatened her life; and demanded money. The victim
also testified that she fought her attacker throughout the incident. In
addition, there was undisputed testimony that the defendant asked others
to lie about his whereabouts that morning and changed his appearance and
clothes immediately following the attack.

We hold that the evidence did not satisfy the threshold requirement of
some credible evidence of abandonment of attempted first degree murder.
A defendant must present some affirmative evidence of his abandonment of
the crime to raise the defense. The defendant\'s mere
withdrawal---particularly when faced with resistance by the
victim---before completing the murder or the robbery is insufficient
evidence of abandonment. Because the defendant did not present some
credible evidence of abandonment, the defendant was not entitled to a
jury instruction on an affirmative defense on that issue.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.

Questions Regarding Attempt

 

1\. Why is heightened proof of mens rea (sometimes called \"specific
intent\") required for attempt?

2\. What are the retributive and utilitarian rationales for the various
tests for attempt\'s actus reus, i.e. (a) proximity text (Rizzo & Bell);
(b) unequivocal act test (McQuirter), and (c) then MPC substantial test
and abandonment test?

3\. How does attempt doctrine interact with the general rule that
omissions are not punished? Or with the rule that we do not punish just
bad thoughts? (Hint: think of proof issues)

State v. Gladstone

 

### *State v. Gladstone*

Supreme Court of Washington

474 P.2d 274 (Wash. 1970)

 

ALE, J.

A jury found defendant Bruce Gladstone guilty of aiding and abetting one
Robert Kent in the unlawful sale of marijuana. Deferring imposition of
sentence, the court placed defendant on probation. He appeals the order
deferring sentencing contending that the evidence as a matter of law was
insufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. His point, we think, is
well taken.

One who aids or abets another in the commission of a crime is guilty as
a principal under RCW 9.01.030, which says:

Every person concerned in the commission of a felony, gross misdemeanor
or misdemeanor, whether he directly commits the act constituting the
offense, or aids or abets in its commission, and whether present or
absent; and every person who directly or indirectly counsels,
encourages, hires, commands, induces or otherwise procures another to
commit a felony, gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor, is a principal, and
shall be proceeded against and punished as such. The fact that the
person aided, abetted, counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced
or procured, could not or did not entertain a criminal intent, shall not
be a defense to any person aiding, abetting, counseling, encouraging,
hiring, commanding, inducing or procuring him.

Gladstone\'s guilt as an aider and abettor in this case rests solely on
evidence of a conversation between him and one Douglas MacArthur
Thompson concerning the possible purchase of marijuana from one Robert
Kent. There is no other evidence to connect the accused with Kent who
ultimately sold some marijuana to Thompson.

When asked by Thompson an agent of the police where marijuana could be
bought, the defendant did no more than name Kent as an individual who
might be willing to sell some and draw a sketch of his location. There
was no evidence whatever that the defendant had any association,
understanding, agreement or arrangement, direct or indirect, tacit or
express with Kent to aid or persuade him in any way in the sale of
marijuana.

The conversation between defendant and Thompson occurred at defendant\'s
residence. Douglas MacArthur Thompson, a 25-year-old student at the
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma and an employee of the Internal
Revenue Service of the United States, had done some investigative work
for the government. From time to time, the Tacoma Police Department
engaged him to investigate the use, possession and sale of narcotics,
principally marijuana, among college students. When working for the
Tacoma Police Department, he operated under the control and direction of
the department\'s narcotics detail.

Thompson testified that Lieutenant Seymour and Detective Gallwas of the
narcotics detail asked him to attempt purchase of marijuana from
Gladstone. During the evening of April 10, 1967 between 10 and 11
o\'clock the two officers and Thompson drove in a police car to the
vicinity of defendant\'s apartment. Thompson went to Gladstone\'s door
alone, beyond the hearing and out of the sight of the two officers. He
knocked at the door and Gladstone responded. Thompson asked Gladstone if
he would sell him some marijuana. Describing this incident, Thompson
testified as follows:

Well, I asked at the time Gladstone told me that he was he did not have
enough marijuana on hand to sell me any, but he did know an individual
who had quite a sufficient quantity and that was very willing to sell
and he named the individual as Robert Kent, or Bob Kent as he put it,
and he gave me directions to the residence and he due to the directions
I asked him if, you know, if he could draw me a map and he did.

When Thompson said he asked Gladstone to draw the map for him, he added,
\"I\'m not sure whether he did give me the exact address or not, he told
me where the residence was.\" He said that Gladstone then with pencil
and paper sketched the location of Kent\'s place of residence. Thompson
had no prior knowledge of where Kent lived, and did not know if he might
have marijuana or that he had ever possessed it.

The two officers then took Thompson to Kent\'s residence where marijuana
was purchased. The actual purchase was made by Thompson directly from
Kent while Officer Gallwas and Lieutenant Seymour stayed in the police
car. Kent was subsequently arrested and convicted of selling Thompson
approximately 8 ounces of marijuana the very sale which defendant here
was convicted of aiding and abetting.

That ended the prosecution\'s case. Even if it were accorded all
favorable inferences, there appears at this point a gap in the evidence
which we feel as a matter of law is fatal to the prosecution\'s cause.
Neither on direct examination nor under cross-examination did Thompson
testify that he knew of any prior conduct, arrangements or
communications between Gladstone and Kent from which it could be even
remotely inferred that the defendant had any understanding, agreement,
purpose, intention or design to participate or engage in or aid or abet
any sale of marijuana by Kent. Other than to obtain a simple map from
Gladstone and to say that Gladstone told him Kent might have some
marijuana available, Thompson did not even establish that Kent and the
defendant were acquainted with each other. Testimony of the brief
conversation and Gladstone\'s very crude drawing consisting of 8
penciled lines indicating where Kent lived constitute the whole proof of
the aiding and abetting presented.

If all reasonable inferences favorable to the state are accorded the
evidence, it does not, in our opinion, establish the commission of the
crime charged. That vital element a nexus between the accused and the
party whom he is charged with aiding and abetting in the commission of a
crime is missing. The record contains no evidence whatever that
Gladstone had any communication by word, gesture or sign, before or
after he drew the map, from which it could be inferred that he
counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced or procured Kent to
sell marijuana to Douglas Thompson as charged, or took any steps to
further the commission of the crime charged. He was not charged with
aiding and abetting Thompson in the purchase of marijuana, but with
Kent\'s sale of it.

Gladstone\'s culpability, if at all, must be brought within RCW
9.01.030, which makes a principal of one who aids and abets another in
the commission of the crime. Although an aider and abettor need not be
physically present at the commission of the crime to be held guilty as a
principal, his conviction depends on proof that he did something in
association or connection with the principal to accomplish the crime.
Learned Hand, J., we think, hit the nail squarely when, in *United
States v. Peoni*, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938), he wrote that, in
order to aid and abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that a
defendant

. . . in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he
participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he
seek by his action to make it succeed. All the words used even the most
colorless, \"abet\" carry an implication of purposive attitude towards
it. . .

There being no evidence whatever that the defendant ever communicated to
Kent the idea that he would in any way aid him in the sale of any
marijuana, or said anything to Kent to encourage or induce him or direct
him to do so, or counseled Kent in the sale of marijuana, or did
anything more than describe Kent to another person as an individual who
might sell some marijuana, or would derive any benefit, consideration or
reward from such a sale, there was no proof of an aiding and abetting,
and the conviction should, therefore, be reversed as a matter of law.

20.1.2

Rosemond v. United States

 

 Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the
Court.\[[1](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/65/#F1)\]\*

    \...

     The Government charged Rosemond with, inter alia, violating §924(c)
by using a gun in connection with a drug trafficking crime, or aiding
and abetting that offense under §2 of Title 18. Section 924(c) provides
that "any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or
drug trafficking crime\[,\] . . . uses or carries a firearm," shall
receive a five-year mandatory-minimum sentence, with seven- and ten-year
minimums applicable, respectively, if the firearm is also brandished or
discharged. 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). Section 2, for its part, is the
federal aiding and abetting statute: It provides that "\[w\]hoever
commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels,
commands, induces or procures its commission is punishable as a
principal."

    \[T\]he Government prosecuted the §924(c) charge on two alternative
theories. The Government's primary contention was that Rosemond himself
used the firearm during the aborted drug transaction. But recognizing
that the identity of the shooter was disputed, the Government also
offered a back-up argument: Even if it was Joseph who fired the gun as
the drug deal fell apart, Rosemond aided and abetted the §924(c)
violation.

     \[The district judge instructed the jury\] that it could convict if
"(1) the defendant knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug
trafficking crime, and (2) the defendant knowingly and actively
participated in the drug trafficking crime." Id., at 196.     

     The jury convicted Rosemond of violating §924(c) \... . \...

     The Tenth Circuit affirmed. \...

     We granted certiorari, 569 U. S. \_\_\_ (2013), to resolve the
Circuit conflict over what it takes to aid and abet a §924(c) offense.
\[W\]e find that the trial court erred in instructing the jury. We
therefore vacate the judgment below.

II

     The federal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U. S. C. §2, states
that a person who furthers---more specifically, who "aids, abets,
counsels, commands, induces or procures"---the commission of a federal
offense "is punishable as a principal." That provision derives from
(though simplifies) common-law standards for accomplice liability. \...
And in so doing, §2 reflects a centuries-old view of culpability: that a
person may be responsible for a crime he has not personally carried out
if he helps another to complete its commission. \...

     As at common law, a person is liable under §2 for aiding and
abetting a crime if (and only if) he (1) takes an affirmative act in
furtherance of that offense, (2) with the intent of facili-tating the
offense's commission. 

     The questions that the parties dispute \... concern how those two
requirements \... apply in a prosecution for aiding and abetting a
§924(c) offense. \... The prosecutor must show the use or carriage of a
gun; so too he must prove the commission of a predicate (violent or drug
trafficking) offense. \... Rosemond therefore could assist in §924(c)'s
violation by facilitating either the drug transaction or the firearm use
\... . It is inconsequential \... that his acts did not advance each
element of the offense; all that matters is that they facilitated one
component. \...

    \[A\]n aiding and abetting conviction requires not just an act
facilitating one or another element, but also a state of mind extending
to the entire crime. See infra, at 11. And under that rule, a defendant
may be convicted of abetting a §924(c) violation only if his intent
reaches beyond a simple drug sale, to an armed one. \... And the
canonical formulation of that needed state of mind---later appropriated
by this Court and oft-quoted in both parties' briefs---is Judge Learned
Hand's: To aid and abet a crime, a defendant must not just "in some sort
associate himself with the venture," but also "participate in it as in
something that he wishes to bring about" and "seek by his action to make
it succeed." \...

     We have previously found that intent requirement satisfied when a
person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge
of the circumstances constituting the charged offense. \... So for
purposes of aiding and abetting law, a person who actively participates
in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and character intends that
scheme's
commission.\[[9](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/65/#F9)\]

     The same principle holds here: An active participant in a drug
transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a §924(c) violation
when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun. In such a
case, the accomplice has decided to join in the criminal venture, and
share in its benefits, with full awareness of its scope---that the plan
calls not just for a drug sale, but for an armed one. In so doing, he
has chosen (like the abettors in Pereira and Bozza or the driver in an
armed robbery) to align himself with the illegal scheme in its
entirety---including its use of a firearm. And he has determined (again
like those other abettors) to do what he can to "make \[that scheme\]
succeed." Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. He thus becomes responsible,
in the typical way of aiders and abettors, for the conduct of others. He
may not have brought the gun to the drug deal himself, but because he
took part in that deal knowing a confederate would do so, he intended
the commission of a §924(c) offense---i.e., an armed drug sale.

     For all that to be true, though, the §924(c) defendant's knowledge
of a firearm must be advance knowledge---or otherwise said, knowledge
that enables him to make the relevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice.
When an accomplice knows beforehand of a confederate's design to carry a
gun, he can attempt to alter that plan or, if unsuccessful, withdraw
from the enterprise; it is deciding instead to go ahead with his role in
the venture that shows his intent to aid an armed offense. But when an
accomplice knows nothing of a gun until it appears at the scene, he may
already have completed his acts of assistance; or even if not, he may at
that late point have no realistic opportunity to quit the crime. And
when that is so, the defendant has not shown the requisite intent to
assist a crime involving a gun. As even the Government concedes, an
unarmed accomplice cannot aid and abet a §924(c) violation unless he has
"foreknowledge that his confederate will commit the offense with a
firearm." Brief for United States 38; see also infra, at 15--17. For the
reasons just given, we think that means knowledge at a time the
accomplice can do something with it---most notably, opt to walk
away.\[[10](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/65/#F10)\]

     Both parties here find something to dislike in our view of this
issue. Rosemond argues that a participant in a drug deal intends to
assist a §924(c) violation only if he affirmatively desires one of his
confederates to use a gun. \[A\]ccording to Rosemond, the instructions
must \[permit the jury to find\] that although the defendant
participated in a drugdeal knowing a gun would be involved, he did not
spe-cifically want its carriage or use. That higher standard, Rosemond
claims, is necessary to avoid subjecting persons of different
culpability to the same punishment. Rosemond offers as an example an
unarmed driver assisting in the heist of a store: If that person spent
the drive "trying to persuade \[his confederate\] to leave \[the\] gun
behind," then he should be convicted of abetting shoplifting, but not
armed robbery. Reply Brief 9.

     We think not. What matters for purposes of gauging intent, and so
what jury instructions should convey, is that the defendant has chosen,
with full knowledge, to participate in the illegal scheme---not that, if
all had been left to him, he would have planned the identical crime.
Consider a variant of Rosemond's example: The driver of a getaway car
wants to help rob a convenience store (and argues passionately for that
plan), but eventually accedes when his confederates decide instead to
hold up a national bank. Whatever his original misgivings, he has the
requisite intent to aid and abet bank robbery\... . The same is true of
an accomplice who knowingly joins in an armed drug
transaction---regardless whether he was formerly indifferent or even
resistant to using firearms. The law does not, nor should it, care
whether he participates with a happy heart or a sense of foreboding.
Either way, he has the same culpability, because either way he has
knowingly elected to aid in the commission of a peculiarly risky form of
offense.

     \...

     The Government, for its part, thinks \... the jury should convict
such a defendant even if he became aware of the gun only after he
realistically could have opted out of the crime.

     But that approach, we think, would diminish too far the requirement
that a defendant in a §924(c) prosecution must intend to further an
armed drug deal. Assume,for example, that an accomplice agrees to
participate in a drug sale on the express condition that no one brings a
gun to the place of exchange. But just as the parties are making the
trade, the accomplice notices that one of his confederates has a
(poorly) concealed firearm in his jacket. The Government would convict
the accomplice of aiding and abetting a §924(c) offense if he assists in
completing the deal without incident, rather than running away or
otherwise aborting the sale. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. But behaving as
the Government suggests might increase the risk of gun violence---to the
accomplice himself, other participants, or bystanders; and conversely,
finishing the sale might be the best or only way to avoid that danger.
In such a circumstance, a jury is entitled to find that the defendant
intended only a drug sale---that he never intended to facilitate, and so
does not bear responsibility for, a drug deal carried out with a gun. A
defendant manifests that greater intent, and incurs the greater
liability of §924(c), when he chooses to participate in a drug
transaction knowing it will involve a firearm; but he makes no such
choice when that knowledge comes too late for him to be reasonably able
to act upon it. \...

III

    \[T\]he District Court erred in instructing the jury, because it did
not explain that Rosemond needed advance knowledge of a firearm's
presence. \...

It is so ordered.

Notes

[9](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/65/#T9)  We did not
deal in these cases, nor do we here, with defendants who incidentally
facilitate a criminal venture rather than actively participate in it. A
hypothetical case is the owner of a gun store who sells a firearm to a
criminal, knowing but not caring how the gun will be used. We express no
view about what sort of facts, if any, would suffice to show that such a
third party has the intent necessary to be convicted of aiding and
abetting.

 Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, con-curring in part and
dissenting in part.

     I largely agree with the analysis \... but \... I reject the
Court's conclusion that a conviction for aiding and abetting a violation
of 18 U. S. C. §924(c) demands proof that the alleged aider and abettor
had what the Court terms "a realistic opportunity" to refrain from
engaging in the conduct at issue. \... This rule represents an important
and, as far as I am aware, unprecedented alteration of the law of aiding
and abetting and of the law of intentionality generally.

     \... I begin with our case law on the mens rea required to
establish aiding and abetting. There is some tension in our cases on
this point. Specifically, some of our cases suggest that an aider and
abettor must act purposefully or with intent. \...

     On the other hand, there are cases \... that appear to hold that
the requisite mens rea is simply knowledge. \... The Court refers
interchangeably to both of these tests and thus leaves our case law in
the same, somewhat conflicted state that previously ex-isted. But
because the difference between acting purposefully \... and acting
knowingly is slight, this is not a matter of great concern.

     \[H\]owever, the Court veers off in a new and \... most unfortunate
direction. The Court imagines the following situation:

"\[A\]n accomplice agrees to participate in a drug sale on the express
condition that no one brings a gun to the place of exchange. But just as
the parties are making the trade, the accomplice notices that one of his
confederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in his jacket." Ante, at
15.

\[Tje Court asks, \"If the accomplice, despite spotting the gun,
continues to assist in the completion of the drug sale, has the
accomplice aided and abetted the commission of a violation of
§924(c)?\"\]

     The Court's answer is "it depends." \[T\]he Court says that if the
risk of walking away exceeds (by some unspecified degree) the risk
created by completing the sale and if the alleged aider and abettor
chooses to continue for that reason, the alleged aider and abettor lacks
the mens rea required for conviction. \...

     The Court confuses two fundamentally distinct concepts: intent and
motive. It seems to assume that, if a defendant's motive in aiding a
criminal venture is to avoid some greater evil, he does not have the
intent that the venture succeed. But the intent to undertake some act is
of course perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse
consequences which would otherwise occur. \... People wake up, go to
work, balance their checkbooks, shop for groceries---and yes, commit
crimes---because they believe something bad will happen if they do not
do these things, not because the deepest desire of their heart is to do
them. A person may only go to work in the morning to keep his or her
family from destitution; that does not mean he or she does not intend to
put in a full day's work. In the same way, the fact that a defendant
carries out a crime because he feels he must do so on pain of terrible
consequences does not mean he does not intend to carry out the crime.
When Jean Valjean stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving family, he
certainly intended to commit theft. \...

     I respectfully dissent from that portion of the Court's opinion
which places on the Government the burden of proving that the alleged
aider and abettor of a §924(c) offense had what the Court terms "a
realistic opportunity" to refrain from engaging in the conduct at issue.

In 2014 the Supreme Court announced a major new decision on accomplice
liability. The link below provides a very useful summary. How, if at

law?

371 S.E.2d 366

 

# **Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia**

# **State v. Hoselton**

371 S.E.2d 366

**\[ ... \]**

July 22, 1988.

William E. Kiger, Darla A. Greathouse, Parkersburg, for Kevin Dwayne
Hoselton.

Richard M. Richmond, Asst. Pros. Atty., Wood County, Parkersburg, for
the State.

PER CURIAM:

This case is before the Court upon the appeal of Kevin Wayne Hoselton
from his conviction of entering without breaking a vessel, with intent
to commit larceny, pursuant to *W.Va.Code,* 61-3-12 \[1923\].^\[1\]^

The accused was charged in a two-count indictment as a principal in the
first degree for either breaking and entering or entering without
breaking a storage unit on a docked barge with intent to commit larceny.
He was eighteen years old at the time, and was with several friends,
each of whom was separately indicted as a principal in the first degree.
The accused was convicted of entering without breaking, as charged in
the indictment.^\[2\]^

The only evidence used to link the accused to the crime was his
voluntary statement.\[ ... \] The pertinent answers given by the accused
in his voluntary statement were, as follows:

1.  Were you with some individuals that broke into the barge?

2.  Yes, sir.

3.  Once you got to the barges, what happened?

4.  We all walked up on that, and I was standing outside there. Mike, he
    tried to get the big door open, and he couldn't do it.

5.  M\[ \... \] A\[ \... \]?

6.  Yes, sir. And I heard a couple of other people back there --- I
    don't know who it was --- trying to get in.

7.  Why couldn't you see them?

8.  Because I was standing at the end of the barge there.

9.  Were you keeping a look-out?

10. You could say that. I just didn't want to go down in there.

11. Do you know who actually gained entry to the barge.

12. No, sir, I'm not sure.

13. Kevin, did you know at the time that you were down there that you
    all were committing a crime?

14. Yes, I did know that, but\...

The items stolen from the storage unit were tools, grease guns, grease
and a battery charger. None of these items, or profits on their resale,
were given to the accused. In both his statement and his trial
testimony, the accused stated that he, standing at one end of the barge,
with an obstructed view of the storage unit, was unaware of his friends'
intent to steal the items until he heard the opening of the storage unit
door. He then walked to the unit and saw his friends handling the goods.
He then returned to the other end of the barge and went to an
automobile, owned and operated by one of his friends, who remained in
the storage facility. His friends returned to the automobile with the
goods. The accused did not assist the others in placing the goods in the
automobile. He was then immediately driven home.

The accused testified that he and his friends frequently trespassed upon
the barge for fishing.

On appeal, the accused contends that the evidence is insufficient to
support a conviction for entering with intent to commit larceny.
Therefore, the trial judge erred when he denied the accused's motions
for acquittal and new trial.

The State contends there was sufficient evidence to establish that the
accused was a lookout, therefore, the conviction for breaking and
entering as a principal in the first degree should stand.

A lookout is one who is "by prearrangement, keeping watch to avoid
interception or detection or to provide warning during the perpetration
of the crimes and thereby participating in the offenses charged \..."

This Court has consistently held that lookouts are aiders and abettors,
principals in the second degree. *\[ ... \]*

Principals in the second degree are punishable as principals in the
first degree. *W.Va.Code,* 61-11-6 \[1923\],

An aider and abettor, or principal in the second degree must "in some
sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as
something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek\[s\] by his action
to make it succeed." *State v. Harper,* 179 W.Va. 24, 28**\[ ... \]\[
... \]**(1987), *quoting* Learned Hand in *U.S. v. Peoni,* 100 F.2d 401,
402 (2nd Cir.1938).

It is well established that in order for a defendant to be convicted as
an aider and abettor, and thus a principal in the second degree, the
prosecution must demonstrate that he or she shared the criminal intent
of the principal in the first degree, \[citations omitted\] Of course we
also recognize that the defendant is not required to possess the
identical intent as the principal in the first degree.

*State v. Harper,* 179 W.Va. 24, 29**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** (1987).^\[3\]^

Therefore, if the State establishes evidence that an accused acted as a
lookout, it has necessarily established the requisite act and mental
state to support a conviction of aiding and abetting. \[ ... \]

In this case, the only evidence that suggested the accused was a lookout
was his response to the investigating officer's questioning: "Q. Were
you a lookout? A. You could say that. I just didn't want to go down
there."

In both his voluntary statement and during his testimony at trial, the
accused stated that he had no prior knowledge of his friends' intentions
to steal anything from the barge. When he heard the door open to the
storage unit and saw his friends removing the goods, the accused left
the barge and returned to the car. The accused never received any of the
stolen property, which was later retrieved by the police from the other
defendants.

[\[T\]]{.underline}he accused's response that "\[y\]ou could say" he was
a lookout, standing completely alone, does not establish that the
accused was an aider and abettor by participating in, and wishing to
bring about the entering with intent to commit larceny.

Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the State did not
prove that the accused was a lookout. Therefore, his conviction as a
principal in the first degree is reversed as it failed to prove that the
accused entered the vessel with shared intent to commit larceny.

We therefore reverse and set aside the accused's conviction for entering
without breaking.\[ ... \]

Reversed.

 

^\[1\]^ *W. Va.Code,* 61-3-12 \[1923\] reads, in pertinent part:

> If any person shall, at any time, break and enter, or shall enter
> without breaking, any \... steamboat or other boat or vessel, within
> the jurisdiction of any county in this State, with intent to commit a

^\[3\]^ *See* LaFave & Scott, *Substantive Criminal Law,* § 6 (1986),
using the Model Penal Code definition of accomplices (principals in the
second degree and accessories before the fact), Professor Scott writes:

\[i\]t is useful to give separate consideration to whether a person has
engaged in the requisite acts (or omissions) and to whether he had the
requisite mental state\.... It may generally be said that one is liable
as an accomplice to the crime of another if he (a) gave assistance or
encouragement or failed to perform a legal duty to prevent it (b) with
the intent thereby to promote or facilitate commission of the crime.
There is a split of authority as to whether some lesser mental state
will suffice for accomplice liability, such as mere knowledge that one
is aiding a crime or knowledge that one is aiding reckless or negligent
conduct which may produce a criminal result.

\... \[Acts or omissions which establish accomplice liability must
exhibit\] sufficient encouragement that the accomplice is standing by at
the scene of the crime ready to give some aid if needed, although in
such a case it is necessary that the principal actually be aware of the
accomplice's intentions. An undisclosed intention to render aid if
needed will not suffice, for it cannot encourage the principal in his
commission of the crime. Quite clearly, mere presence at the scene of
the crime is not enough, nor is mental approval of the actor\'s conduct.
Also, in the absence of unique circumstances giving rise to a duty to do
so, one does not become an accomplice by refusing to intervene in the
commission of a crime. \[§ 6.7(a) \]

\... \[A mental state must be evinced which establishes that\] the
accomplice intentionally encourages or assists, in the sense that his
purpose is to encourage or assist another in the commission of a crime
as to which the accomplice has the requisite mental state\.... liability
without fault does not obtain in this area. \[§ 6.7(b)\]

Commonwealth v. Roebuck, 32 A.3d 613 (Pa. 2011)

 

Justice
[SAYLOR](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=h&pubNum=176284&cite=0192902301&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=RQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)).

In this appeal, we consider whether it is possible, as a matter of law,
to be convicted as an accomplice to third-degree murder.

 The ... victim was lured to an apartment complex, where he was
ambushed, shot, and mortally wounded. Appellant participated, with
others, in orchestrating the events, but he did not shoot the victim.

 Appellant was charged with ... murder of the third degree. 18 Pa.C.S. §
2502(c). \[T\]he Commonwealth relied upon accomplice theory, codified in
Section 306 of the Crimes Code along with other complicity-based
accountability principles. The matter proceeded to a bench trial, and a
verdict of guilt ensued.

 On appeal, Appellant argued that there is no rational legal theory to
support accomplice liability for third-degree murder. He rested his
position on the following syllogism: accomplice liability attaches only
where the defendant *intends* to facilitate or promote an underlying
offense; third-degree murder is an *unintentional* killing committed
with malice; therefore, to adjudge a criminal defendant guilty of
third-degree murder as an accomplice would be to accept that the accused
*intended* to aid an *unintentional* act, which is a logical
impossibility.

 The Superior Court ... highlighted the following statutory prescription
pertaining to the requisite *mens rea* (or mental state) \[and which
tracks MPC § 2.06(4)\]:

When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an
accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the
commission of that offense, if he acts with the kind of culpability, if
any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission
of the offense. \[189 Pa. C.S.\] [§
306(d)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000262&cite=PA18S306&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)#co_pp_5ba1000067d06).
...

In reply and in relevant part, the Commonwealth posits that accomplice
liability readily pertains to murder of the third degree \[because\] it
is the shared criminal intent motivating the underlying conduct (here,
designing to stage a very dangerous altercation) which establishes the
requisite criminal culpability. ... According to the Commonwealth, it is
both rational and sensible to hold one who aids another in malicious
conduct to account to the same degree as the principal for foreseeable
consequences of the wrongful actions. *...*

 At the outset, it certainly is possible for a state legislature to
employ complicity theory to establish legal accountability on the part
of an accomplice for foreseeable but unintended results caused by a
principal. Indeed, this was the express design of the American Law
Institute's widely influential Model Penal Code.

 To provide appropriate context in considering the MPC's treatment of
complicity theory, it is helpful to review some of the Code's core
theoretical underpinnings. Also impacting on this discussion, the MPC
does not employ the term "malice" in its treatment of the crime of
murder, but rather, expresses the concept as "reckless\[ness\] under
circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human
life." ...

In addressing the terms of the Model Penal Code, it is important to bear
in mind that the Code employs an elements approach to substantive
criminal law, which recognizes that a single offense definition may
require different culpable mental states for each objective offense
element. *...*

 Conceptually, the MPC also recognizes three objective categories of
offense elements---conduct, attendant circumstances, and result. *See*
[MPC §
2.02](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS2.02&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)).
The Code frequently distinguishes among these offense-element categories
in its various prescriptions regarding which of the four levels of
culpability must be established for any given offense element....

The legal accountability of accomplices for the conduct of others is
treated in 2.06 of the Code. \[The key MPC provisions are MPC § 2.06(3)
and (4)\]:

\(3\) A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of
an offense if \... with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the
commission of the offense, he \... aids or agrees or attempts to aid
such other person in planning or committing it\[.\]

\(4\) When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an
accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the
commission of that offense if he acts with the kind of culpability, if
any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission
of the offense.

Section 206(4) thus prescribes that an accomplice may be held legally
accountable where he is an "accomplice in the conduct"---or, in other
words, aids another in planning or committing the conduct with the
purpose of promoting or facilitating it---and acts with recklessness
(*i.e.,* the "kind of culpability \... sufficient for the commission of"
a reckless-result offense).

 \[MPC\] commentary explains that the term "commission of the offense,"
as used in [Section
2.06(3)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS2.06&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)#co_pp_d08f0000f5f67),
focuses on the *conduct,* not the result. *See id.* § 2.06, cmt. 6(b),
at 310 ... This diffuses any impression that an accomplice must always
intend results essential to the completed crime. *...* The commentary
then points to the fourth subsection as supplying the essential
culpability requirement, as follows:

One who solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is
an accomplice in whatever means may be employed, insofar as they
constitute or commit an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the
association. But *when a wholly different crime has been committed, thus
involving conduct not within the conscious objectives of the accomplice,
he is not liable for it unless the case falls within the specific terms
of Subsection (4).*

[MPC §
2.06](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS2.06&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)),
cmt. 6(b), at 311 (emphasis added). According to the commentary, the
purport of the fourth subsection is to hold the accomplice accountable
for contributing to the conduct to the degree his culpability equals
what is required to support liability of a principal actor. ...

concurring: ... As Appellant's syllogism is based on a false premise,
his argument fails. Indeed, an accomplice to third degree murder does
not intend to aid an unintentional murder; he intends to aid a malicious
act which results in a killing. Suppose an accomplice hands a gun to the
principal and says "shoot that victim---I don't care if he dies or not,
but shoot him." The principal shoots the victim in the leg, but the
victim dies---it is classic third degree murder, there being no proof of
specific intent to kill, but a clearly malicious act regardless of the
consequences. The same logic that enables a murder charge against the
principal binds the accomplice as well---both committed an intentional
malicious act that resulted in the death of another, and both are guilty
of the murder charge that follows. \[I concur.\]

People v. Russell

 

### *People v. Russell*

Court of Appeals of New York

693 N.E.2d 193 (1998)

 

KAYE, Chief Judge.

Shortly before noon on December 17, 1992, Shamel Burroughs engaged in a
gun battle with Jermaine Russell and Khary Bekka on Centre Mall of the
Red Hook Housing Project in Brooklyn. During the course of the battle,
Patrick Daly, a public school principal looking for a child who had left
school, was fatally wounded by a single stray nine-millimeter bullet
that struck him in the chest. Burroughs, Bekka and Russell-defendants on
this appeal were all charged with second degree murder (Penal Law §
125.25 \[1\], \[2\] ).

Two separate juries, one for Burroughs and another for Russell and
Bekka, were impanelled contemporaneously and heard the evidence
presented at trial. Although ballistics tests were inconclusive in
determining which defendant actually fired the bullet that killed Daly,
the theory of the prosecution was that each of them acted with the
mental culpability required for commission of the crime, and that each
"intentionally aided" the defendant who fired the fatal shot (Penal Law
§ 20.00). Both juries convicted defendants of second degree, depraved
indifference murder (Penal Law § 125.25\[2\] ).

A depraved indifference murder conviction requires proof that defendant,
under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,
recklessly engaged in conduct creating a grave risk of death to another
person, and thereby caused the death of another person (Penal Law §
125.25\[2\] ). Reckless conduct requires awareness and conscious
disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will
occur or that such circumstance exists (Penal Law § 15.05\[3\] ). "The
risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a
reasonable person would observe in the situation" (*Id.*). To constitute
"depraved indifference," conduct must be " 'so wanton, so deficient in a
moral sense of concern, so devoid of regard of the life or lives of
others, and so blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as
that which the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes the
death of another' " Although defendants underscore that only one bullet
killed Patrick Daly and it is uncertain which of them fired that bullet,
the prosecution was not required to prove which defendant fired the
fatal shot when the evidence was sufficient to establish that each
defendant acted with the mental culpability required for the commission
of depraved indifference murder, and each defendant "intentionally
aided" the defendant who fired the fatal shot. Defendants urge, however,
that the evidence adduced at trial did not support a finding that
they-as adversaries in a deadly gun battle-shared the "community of
purpose" necessary for accomplice liability. We disagree. The fact that
defendants set out to injure or kill one another does not rationally
preclude a finding that they intentionally aided each other to engage in
the mutual combat that caused Daly\'s death.

*People v. Abbott*, 84 A.D.2d 11 provides an apt illustration. That case
involved two defendants-Abbott and Moon-who were engaged in a "drag
race" on a residential street when Abbott lost control and smashed into
another automobile, killing the driver and two passengers. Both
defendants were convicted of criminally negligent homicide, but Moon
asserted that he was not responsible for Abbott\'s actions and that his
conviction should be set aside. Rejecting this argument, the court found
that, although Moon did not strike the victim\'s car and was Abbott\'s
adversary in a competitive race, he intentionally participated with
Abbott in an inherently dangerous and unlawful activity and therefore
shared Abbott\'s culpability. Moon\'s "conduct made the race possible"
in the first place, as there would not have been a race had Moon not
"accepted Abbott\'s challenge" In the present case, the jurors were
instructed:

"If you find that the People have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
\[defendants\] took up each other\'s challenge, shared in the venture
and unjustifiably, voluntarily and jointly created a zone of danger,
then each is responsible for his own acts and the acts of the others . .
. \[and\] it makes no difference whether it was a bullet from Mr.
Bekka\'s gun, Mr. Russell\'s gun or Mr. Burrough\'s gun that penetrated
Mr. Daly and caused his death" (emphasis added).

The trial evidence was sufficient to support each jury\'s findings in
accordance with this charge. Although Burroughs was shooting at Russell
and Bekka, and Russell and Bekka were shooting at Burroughs, there was
adequate proof to justify the finding that the three defendants tacitly
agreed to engage in the gun battle that placed the life of any innocent
bystander at grave risk and ultimately killed Daly. Indeed, unlike an
unanticipated ambush or spontaneous attack that might have taken
defendants by surprise, the gunfight in this case only began after
defendants acknowledged and accepted each others\' challenge to engage
in a deadly battle on a public concourse.

As defendants approached one another on Centre Mall, a grassy open area
that serves as a thoroughfare for the 7,000 residents of the 28-building
housing complex, it was evident that an encounter between them would be
violent and would endanger others. There was trial evidence that when
Burroughs first saw Bekka and Russell walking toward him, he immediately
recognized the danger, instructing the two female friends accompanying
him, one of them pregnant, to "run" or "go." They too plainly sensed the
danger because, without hesitation, they turned and ran.

Despite the palpable threat, Burroughs, armed with a nine-millimeter
Glock, did not flee with his friends. Rather, he continued toward
Russell and Bekka, tacitly accepting their invitation and issuing one of
his own. In turn, Russell and Bekka, also armed with automatic weapons,
continued walking toward Burroughs, challenging him and accepting his
challenge. As they drew nearer, defendants each began firing their
high-powered guns, capable of shooting bullets at an average rate of
1,100 feet per second, across the pedestrian thoroughfare. The dozen or
more people in the area, as well as those with windows overlooking the
Mall, were put at grave risk as defendants unleashed a hail of bullets.
Witnesses testified that the battle sounded "like a war" and that
anywhere from nine to 20 shots were fired.

Although Centre Mall is surrounded by buildings affording refuge,
defendants chose instead to run through the area aggressively pursuing
one another. Indeed, even after exchanging an initial volley of shots,
they continued to wage their private war, issuing taunts and ducking
back and forth behind buildings and trees, seeking tactical advantage.
As a result of defendants\' deadly gun battle, Patrick Daly was shot in
the chest and killed almost instantly.

The evidence adduced at trial was also sufficient for the jury to
determine that all three defendants acted with the mental culpability
required for depraved indifference murder, and that they intentionally
aided and encouraged each other to create the lethal crossfire that
caused the death of Patrick Daly.

Accordingly, in each case the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed.

Wilcox v. Jeffery

 

### *Wilcox v. Jeffery*

High Court of Justice, King's Bench Division

1 All ER 454 (1951)

 

LORD GODDARD, C.J.: This is a case stated by the metropolitan magistrate
at Bow Street Magistrate's Court before whom the appellant, Herbert
William Wilcox, the proprietor of a periodical called \"Jazz
Illustrated," was charged on an information that "on Dec. 11, 1949, he
did unlawfully aid and abet one Coleman Hawkins in contravening art. 1
(4) of the Aliens Order, 1920, by failing to comply with a condition
attached to a grant of leave to land, to wit, that the said Coleman
Hawkins should take no employment paid or unpaid while in the United
Kingdom, contrary to art. 18 (2) of the Aliens Order, 1920."

The case is concerned with the visit of a celebrated professor of the
saxophone, a gentleman by the name of Hawkins who was a citizen of the
United States. He came here at the invitation of two gentlemen of the
name of Curtis and Hughes, connected with a jazz club which enlivens the
neighbourhood of Willesden. They, apparently, had applied for permission
for Mr. Hawkins land and it was refused, but, nevertheless, this
professor of the saxophone arrived with four French musicians. When they
came to the airport, among the people who were there to greet them was
the appellant. He had not arranged their visit, but he knew they were
coming and he was there to report the arrival of these important
musicians for his magazine. So, evidently, he was regarding the visit of
Mr. Hawkins as a matter which would be of interest to himself and the
magazine which he was editing and selling for profit. Messrs. Curtis and
Hughes arranged a concert at the Princes Theatre, London. The appellant
attended that concert as a spectator. He paid for his ticket. Mr.
Hawkins went on the stage and delighted the audience by playing the
saxophone. The appellant did not get up and protest in the name of the
musicians of England that Mr. Hawkins ought not to be here competing
with them and taking the bread out of their mouths or the wind out of
their instruments. It is not found that he actually applauded, but he
was there having paid to go in, and, no doubt, enjoying the performance,
and then, lo and behold, out comes his magazine with a most, laudatory
description, fully illustrated, of this concert. On those facts the
magistrate has found that he aided and abetted.

Reliance is placed by the prosecution on *R. v. Coney* (1) which dealt
with a prize fight. This case relates to a jazz band concert, but the
particular nature of the entertainment provided, whether by fighting
with bare fists or playing on saxophones, does not seem to me to make
any difference to the question which we have to decide. The fact is that
a man is charged with aiding and abetting an illegal act, and I can find
no authority for saying that it matters what that illegal act is,
provided that the aider and abettor knows the facts sufficiently well to
know that they would constitute an offence in the principal. In *R. v.
Coney* (1) the prize fight took place in the neighbourhood of Ascot, and
four or five men were convicted of aiding and abetting the fight. The
conviction was quashed on the ground that the chairman had not given a
correct direction to the jury when he told them that, as the prisoners
were physically present at the fight, they must be held to have aided
and abetted. That direction, the court held, was wrong, it being too
wide. The matter was very concisely put by CAVE, J., whose judgment was
fully concurred in by that great master of the criminal law, STEPHEN, J.
CAVE, J., said (8 Q.B.D. 540):

\"Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence of
aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental it is
evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury."

There was not accidental presence in this case. The appellant paid to go
to the concert and he went there because he wanted to report it. He
must, therefore, be held to have been present, taking part, concurring,
or encouraging, whichever word you like to use for expressing this
conception. It was an illegal act on the part of Hawkins to play the
saxophone or any other instrument at this concert. The appellant clearly
knew that it was an unlawful act for him to play. He had gone there to
hear him, and his presence and his payment to go there was an
encouragement. He went there to make use of the performance, because he
went there, as the magistrate finds and was justified in finding, to get
\"copy\" for his newspaper. It might have been entirely different, as I
say, if he had gone there and protested, saying: "The musicians' union
do not like you foreigners coming here and playing and you ought to get
off the stage.\" If he had booed, it might have been some evidence that
he was not aiding and abetting. If he had gone as a member of a *claque*
to try to drown the noise of the saxophone, he might very likely be
found not guilty of aiding and abetting. In this case it seems clear
that he was there, not only to approve and encourage what was done, but
to take advantage of it by getting \"copy\" for his paper. In those
circumstances there was evidence on which the magistrate could find that
the appellant aided and abetted, and for these reasons I am of opinion
that the appeal fails. 

 

 

 

21.1.2

Note on Wilcox v. Jeffery

 

### Note on Wilcox v. Jeffery and bystander liability

Wilcox raises questions we considered very early in the semester
regarding liability for omissions. The court seems to imply that Wilcox
wouldn't have been liable if he had gone to the show and booed Hawkins
for taking the jobs of hardworking English jazz musicians. So is he
liable for not booing? Did he have an obligation to boo?

A far more serious issue regarding presence and accomplice liability is
presented in the movie The Accused, a fictional account of a brutal
sexual assault that occurred in a New Bedford, Massachusetts bar in
1983. In addition to the four men who carried out that assault, two
patrons were prosecuted for aiding and abetting it by cheering the
attackers on. Those two men were acquitted at trial; the attackers were
convicted. The incident and the subsequent trial are also the subject of
Netflix recent crime anthology series [Trial by
Media](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81025113?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C4%2C3ea89bf7-d93a-47c3-b58c-587077287a18-536876769%2Cd7d3fd5f613b5668299a760a5bb9bb444f52f0e0%3A2f7c334c96031e5da78b7b6d6d2fb27147d284ba%2C%2C).

On what basis should accomplice liability be imposed in such a
situation? For remaining present and not objecting? For leaving and not
going to the authorities? Recall that the general American rule is to
not impose liability for an omission in the absence of a preexisting
legal duty to aid.

Does such a standard make sense in this context?

 

 

 

21.1.3

Hypothetical Based on ex rel. Attorney General v. Tally, Judge

 

*State ex rel. Attorney General v. Tally, Judge*, 15 So. 722 (Ala. 1894)
was an action brought against an Alabama judge for facilitating the four
Skelton brothers in pursuing and ultimately killing a man named Ross
after Ross ran off with their sister (Tally's sister-in-law). The
brothers pursued Ross to a neighboring town intending to kill him and,
upon learning this, a friend of Ross' tried to warn him by telegram.
Tally then sent his own telegram to the telegraph operator, asking him
not to deliver the warning message. The operator in fact did not deliver
the message; the Skeltons caught up with Ross and killed him.

Tally was charged with and convicted of aiding and abetting,\" i.e.
being an accomplice to, the killing of Ross. The Alabama High Court
upheld the conviction. The Court held that it was not necessary to show
that Tally's telegram was even the but-for cause of Ross's death:

The assistance given... need not contribute to the criminal result in
the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite
sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without
it. It is quite enough if the aid merely renders it easier for the
principal actor to accomplish the end intend by him and the aider and
abettor, though in all human probability the end would have been
attained without it.

Is this result consistent with the court's opinion in *Wilcox v.
Jeffery*?

With these results in mind, consider the following variations on the
facts of Tally. What result would we get under MPC §2.06?

1.  Due to a technical glitch, the judge's telegram never reached the
    nearby town and the telegraph operator tried in vain to deliver the
    warning to Ross. However, by the time he found Ross, the Skeltons
    had already found and killed him.

2.  The telegraph operator received Tally's request and did not deliver
    the warning telegram, but the Skeltons never found Ross and he
    escaped town without incident.

3.  Same as 2), above, except that the Skeltons *did* find Ross who
    managed to fight them off and escape town unscathed.

People v. Lauria

 

### *People v. Lauria*

California District Court of Appeals

59 Cal. Rptr. 628 (1967)

 

FLEMING, Associate Justice.

In an investigation of call-girl activity the police focused their
attention on three prostitutes actively plying their trade on call, each
of whom was using Lauria\'s telephone answering service, presumably for
business purposes.

On January 8, 1965, Stella Weeks, a policewoman, signed up for telephone
service with Lauria\'s answering service. Mrs. Weeks, in the course of
her conversation with Lauria\'s office manager, hinted broadly that she
was a prostitute concerned with the secrecy of her activities and their
concealment from the police. She was assured that the operation of the
service was discreet and 'about as safe as you can get.' It was arranged
that Mrs. Weeks need not leave her address with the answering service,
but could pick up her calls and pay her bills in person.

On February 11, Mrs. Weeks talked to Lauria on the telephone and told
him her business was modeling and she had been referred to the answering
service by Terry, one of the three prostitutes under investigation. She
complained that because of the operation of the service she had lost two
valuable customers, referred to as tricks. Lauria defended his service
and said that her friends had probably lied to her about having left
calls for her. But he did not respond to Mrs. Weeks\' hints that she
needed customers in order to make money, other than to invite her to his
house for a personal visit in order to get better acquainted. In the
course of his talk he said 'his business was taking messages.'

On February 15, Mrs. Weeks talked on the telephone to Lauria\'s office
manager and again complained of two lost calls, which she described as a
\$50 and a \$100 trick. On investigation the office manager could find
nothing wrong, but she said she would alert the switchboard operators
about slip-ups on calls.

On April 1 Lauria and the three prostitutes were arrested. Lauria
complained to the police that this attention was undeserved, stating
that Hollywood Call Board had 60 to 70 prostitutes on its board while
his own service had only 9 or 10, that he kept separate records for
known or suspected prostitutes for the convenience of himself and the
police. When asked if his records were available to police who might
come to the office to investigate call girls, Lauria replied that they
were whenever the police had a specific name. However, his service
didn\'t 'arbitrarily tell the police about prostitutes on our board. As
long as they pay their bills we tolerate them.' In a subsequent
voluntary appearance before the Grand Jury Lauria testified he had
always cooperated with the police. But he admitted he knew some of his
customers were prostitutes, and he knew Terry was a prostitute because
he had personally used her services, and he knew she was paying for 500
calls a month.

Lauria and the three prostitutes were indicted for conspiracy to commit
prostitution, and nine overt acts were specified. Subsequently, the
trial court set aside the indictment as having been brought without
reasonable or probable cause. The People have appealed, claiming that a
sufficient showing of an unlawful agreement to further prostitution was
made.

To establish agreement, the People need show no more than a tacit,
mutual understanding between coconspirators to accomplish an unlawful
act. Here the People attempted to establish a conspiracy by showing that
Lauria, well aware that his codefendants were prostitutes who received
business calls from customers through his telephone answering service,
continued to furnish them with such service. This approach attempts to
equate knowledge of another\'s criminal activity with conspiracy to
further such criminal activity, and poses the question of the criminal
responsibility of a furnisher of goods or services who knows his product
is being used to assist the operation of an illegal business. Under what
circumstances does a supplier become a part of a conspiracy to further
an illegal enterprise by furnishing goods or services which he knows are
to be used by the buyer for criminal purposes?

The two leading cases on this point face in opposite directions. In
*United States v. Falcone*, 311 U.S. 205 (1940), the sellers of large
quantities of sugar, yeast, and cans were absolved from participation in
a moonshining conspiracy among distillers who bought from them, while in
*Direct Sales Co. v. United States*, 319 U.S. 703 (1943), a wholesaler
of drugs was convicted of conspiracy to violate the federal narcotic
laws by selling drugs in quantity to a codefendant physician who was
supplying them to addicts. The distinction between these two cases
appears primarily based on the proposition that distributors of such
dangerous products as drugs are required to exercise greater
discrimination in the conduct of their business than are distributors of
innocuous substances like sugar and yeast.

In the earlier case, *Falcone*, the sellers\' knowledge of the illegal
use of the goods was insufficient by itself to make the sellers
participants in a conspiracy with the distillers who bought from them.
Such knowledge fell short of proof of a conspiracy, and evidence on the
volume of sales was too vague to support a jury finding that respondents
knew of the conspiracy from the size of the sales alone.

In the later case of *Direct Sales*, the conviction of a drug wholesaler
for conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws was affirmed on a
showing that it had actively promoted the sale of morphine sulphate in
quantity and had sold codefendant physician, who practiced in a small
town in South Carolina, more than 300 times his normal requirements of
the drug, even though it had been repeatedly warned of the dangers of
unrestricted sales of the drug. The court contrasted the restricted
goods involved in *Direct Sales* with the articles of free commerce
involved in *Falcone*: \"All articles of commerce may be put to illegal
ends,\" said the court. \"But all do not have inherently the same
susceptibility to harmful and illegal use. . . This difference is
important for two purposes. One is for making certain that the seller
knows the buyer\'s intended illegal use. The other is to show that by
the sale he intends to further, promote and cooperate in it. This
intent, when given effect by overt act, is the gist of conspiracy. While
it is not identical with mere knowledge that another purposes unlawful
action, it is not unrelated to such knowledge. . . The step from
knowledge to intent and agreement may be taken. There is more than
suspicion, more than knowledge, acquiescence, carelessness,
indifference, lack of concern. There is informed and interested
cooperation, stimulation, instigation. And there is also a 'stake in the
venture' which, even if it may not be essential, is not irrelevant to
the question of conspiracy.\'\"

While *Falcone* and *Direct Sales* may not be entirely consistent with
each other in their full implications, they do provide us with a
framework for the criminal liability of a supplier of lawful goods or
services put to unlawful use. Both the element of knowledge of the
illegal use of the goods or services and the element of intent to
further that use must be present in order to make the supplier a
participant in a criminal conspiracy.

Proof of knowledge is ordinarily a question of fact and requires no
extended discussion in the present case. The knowledge of the supplier
was sufficiently established when Lauria admitted he knew some of his
customers were prostitutes and admitted he knew that Terry, an active
subscriber to his service, was a prostitute. In the face of these
admissions he could scarcely claim to have relied on the normal
assumption an operator of a business or service is entitled to make,
that his customers are behaving themselves in the eyes of the law.
Because Lauria knew in fact that some of his customers were prostitutes,
it is a legitimate inference he knew they were subscribing to his
answering service for illegal business purposes and were using his
service to make assignations for prostitution. On this record we think
the prosecution is entitled to claim positive knowledge by Lauria of the
use of his service to facilitate the business of position.

The more perplexing issue in the case is the sufficiency of proof of
intent \[ie PURPOSE\] to further the criminal enterprise. The element of
intent may be proved either by direct evidence, or by evidence of
circumstances from which an intent to further a criminal enterprise by
supplying lawful goods or services may be inferred. Direct evidence of
participation, such as advice from the supplier of legal goods or
services to the user of those goods or services on their use for illegal
purposes, provides the simplest case. When the intent to further and
promote the criminal enterprise comes from the lips of the supplier
himself, ambiguities of inference from circumstance need not trouble us.
But in cases where direct proof of complicity is lacking, intent to
further the conspiracy must be derived from the sale itself and its
surrounding circumstances in order to establish the supplier\'s express
or tacit agreement to join the conspiracy.

In the case at bench the prosecution argues that since Lauria knew his
customers were using his service for illegal purposes but nevertheless
continued to furnish it to them, he must have intended to assist them in
carrying out their illegal activities. Thus through a union of knowledge
and intent he became a participant in a criminal conspiracy.
Essentially, the People argue that knowledge alone of the continuing use
of his telephone facilities for criminal purposes provided a sufficient
basis from which his intent to participate in those criminal activities
could be inferred.

In examining precedents in this field we find that sometimes, but not
always, the criminal intent of the supplier may be inferred from his
knowledge of the unlawful use made of the product he supplies. Some
consideration of characteristic patterns may be helpful.

1\. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the purveyor of legal
goods for illegal use has acquired a stake in the venture. (*United
States v. Falcone*, 2 Cir. 109 F.2d 579, 581.) For example, in *Regina
v. Thomas*, (1957), 2 All.E.R. 181, 342, a prosecution for living off
the earnings of prostitution, the evidence showed that the accused,
knowing the woman to be a convicted prostitute, agreed to let her have
the use of his room between the hours of 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. for a charge
of \$3 a night. The Court of Criminal Appeal refused an appeal from the
conviction, holding that when the accused rented a room at a grossly
inflated rent to a prostitute for the purpose of carrying on her trade,
a jury could find he was living on the earnings of prostitution.

In the present case, no proof was offered of inflated charges for the
telephone answering services furnished the codefendants.

2\. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when no legitimate use for
the goods or services exists. The leading California case is *People v.
McLaughlin*, 111 Cal.App.2d 781, 245 P.2d 1076, in which the court
upheld a conviction of the suppliers of horse-racing information by wire
for conspiracy to promote bookmaking, when it had been established that
wireservice information had no other use than to supply information
needed by bookmakers to conduct illegal gambling operations. In *Shaw v.
Director of Public Prosecutions*, (1962) A.C. 220, the defendant was
convicted of conspiracy to corrupt public morals and of living on the
earnings of prostitution, when he published a directory consisting
almost entirely of advertisements of the names, addresses, and
specialized talents of prostitutes. Publication of such a directory,
said the court, could have no legitimate use and serve no other purpose
than to advertise the professional services of the prostitutes whose
advertisements appeared in the directory. The publisher could be deemed
a participant in the profits from the business activities of his
principal advertisers.

Other services of a comparable nature come to mind: the manufacturer of
crooked dice and marked cards who sells his product to gambling casinos;
the tipster who furnishes information on the movement of law enforcement
officers to known lawbreakers. In such cases the supplier must
necessarily have an intent to further the illegal enterprise since there
is no known honest use for his goods.

However, there is nothing in the furnishing of telephone answering
service which would necessarily imply assistance in the performance of
illegal activities. Nor is any inference to be derived from the use of
an answering service by women, either in any particular volume of calls,
or outside normal working hours. Night-club entertainers, registered
nurses, faith healers, public stenographers, photographic models, and
freelance substitute employees, provide examples of women in legitimate
occupations whose employment might cause them to receive a volume of
telephone calls at irregular hours.

\[Or\] 3. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the volume of
business with the buyer is grossly disproportionate to any legitimate
demand, or when sales for illegal use amount to a high proportion of the
seller\'s total business. In such cases an intent to participate in the
illegal enterprise may be inferred from the quantity of the business
done. For example, in *Direct Sales*, supra, the sale of narcotics to a
rural physician in quantities 300 times greater than he would have
normal use for provided potent evidence of an intent to further the
illegal activity. In the same case the court also found significant the
fact that the wholesaler had attracted as customers a disproportionately
large group of physicians who had been convicted of violating the
Harrison Act. In *Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions*, (1962) A.C.
220, almost the entire business of the directory came from prostitutes.

No evidence of any unusual volume of business with prostitutes was
presented by the prosecution against Lauria.

Inflated charges, the sale of goods with no legitimate use, sales in
inflated amounts, each may provide a fact of sufficient moment from
which the intent of the seller to participate in the criminal enterprise
may be inferred. In such instances participation by the supplier of
legal goods to the illegal enterprise may be inferred because in one way
or another the supplier has acquired a special interest in the operation
of the illegal enterprise. His intent to participate in the crime of
which he has knowledge may be inferred from the existence of his special
interest.

Yet there are cases in which it cannot reasonably be said that the
supplier has a stake in the venture or has acquired a special interest
in the enterprise, but in which he has been held liable as a participant
on the basis of knowledge alone. Some suggestion of this appears in
*Direct Sales*, supra, where both the knowledge of the illegal use of
the drugs and the intent of the supplier to aid that use were inferred.
. . For instance, we think the operator of a telephone answering service
with positive knowledge that this service was being used to facilitate
the extortion of ransom, the distribution of heroin, or the passing of
counterfeit money who continued to furnish the service with knowledge of
its use, might be chargeable on knowledge alone with participation in a
scheme to extort money, to distribute narcotics, or to pass counterfeit
money. The same result would follow the seller of gasoline who knew the
buyer was using his product to make Molotov cocktails for terroristic
use.

Logically, the same reasoning could be extended to crimes of every
description. Yet we do not believe an inference of intent drawn from
knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes
classified as misdemeanors. The duty to take positive action to
dissociate oneself from activities helpful to violations of the criminal
law as far stronger and more compelling for felonies than it is for
misdemeanors or petty offenses. In this respect, as in others, the
distinction between felonies and misdemeanors, between more serious and
less serious crime, retains continuing vitality. In historically the
most serious felony, treason, an individual with knowledge of the
treason can be prosecuted for concealing and failing to disclose it. In
other felonies, both at common law and under the criminal laws of the
United States, an individual knowing of the commission of a felony is
criminally liable for concealing it and failing to make it known to
proper authority. But this crime, known as misprision of felony, has
always been limited to knowledge and concealment of felony and has never
extended to misdemeanor.

With respect to misdemeanors, we conclude that positive knowledge of the
supplier that his products or services are being used for criminal
purposes does not, without more, establish an intent of the supplier to
participate in the misdemeanors. With respect to felonies, we do not
decide the converse, viz. that in all cases of felony knowledge of
criminal use alone may justify an inference of supplier\'s intent to
participate in the crime.

From this analysis of precedent we deduce the following rule: the intent
of a supplier who knows of the criminal use to which his supplies are
put to participate in the criminal activity connected with the use of
his supplies may be established by (1) direct evidence that he intends
to participate, or (2) through an inference that he intends to
participate based on, (a) his special interest in the activity, or (b)
the aggravated nature of the crime itself.

When we review Lauria\'s activities in the light of this analysis, we
find no proof that Lauria took any direct action to further, encourage,
or direct the call-girl activities of his codefendants and we find an
absence of circumstances from which his special interest in their
activities could be inferred. Neither excessive charges for standardized
services, nor the furnishing of services without a legitimate use, nor
an unusual quantity of business with call girls, are present. The
offense which he is charged with furthering is a misdemeanor, a category
of crime which has never been made a required subject of positive
disclosure to public authority. Under these circumstances, although
proof of Lauria\'s knowledge of the criminal activities of his patrons
was sufficient to charge him with that fact, there was insufficient
evidence that he intended to further their criminal activities, and
hence insufficient proof of his participation in a criminal conspiracy
with his codefendants to further prostitution. Since the conspiracy
centered around the activities of Lauria\'s telephone answering service,
the charges against his codefendants likewise fail for want of proof.

In absolving Lauria of complicity in a criminal conspiracy we do not
wish to imply that the public authorities are without remedies to combat
modern manifestations of the world\'s oldest profession. Licensing of
telephone answering services under the police power, together with the
revocation of licenses for the toleration of prostitution, is a possible
civil remedy. The furnishing of telephone answering service in aid of
prostitution could be made a crime. Other solutions will doubtless occur
to vigilant public authorities if the problem of call-girl activity
needs further suppression.

The order is affirmed.

VAN NORTWICK, J.

Christopher S. Perry challenges his multiple convictions and sentences
arising from the repeated sexual battery of his daughter, E.P., by
another man, Robert G. Young. In counts 1 through 5 he was charged with
capital sexual battery as a principal to the offenses committed by
Young; in count 6 he was charged with lewd molestation as a principal to
Young's actions; in count 7 he was charged with felony child neglect;
and in count 8 he was charged with conspiracy with his wife and
mother-in-law to commit capital sexual battery on E.P. Perry was
convicted of all 8 counts.

**\[ ... \]**

Perry argues that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion
for a JOA as to count 8 (conspiracy) because there was a lack of
evidence that appellant entered into any sort of agreement with Mary
Perry or Patricia Woloszynowski (the grandmother) to commit the crime of
capital sexual battery on E.P. The offense of conspiracy occurs when a
person "agrees, conspires, combines, or confederates with another person
or persons to commit an offense\.... " § 777.04(3), Fla. Stat. (2011);
*see Bell v. State,* 111 So.3d 199 (Fla. 4th DCA 2013) (holding a
conspiracy exists where there is an express or implied agreement between
two or more persons to commit a criminal offense coupled with an intent
to commit the offense); *Schlicher v. State,* 13 So.3d 515, 517 (Fla.
4th DCA 2009). Proof that a defendant was at the scene of a crime, had
knowledge of it, or aided others in the commission of the substantive
offense is not sufficient proof of conspiracy. *Jackson v. State,* 74
So.3d 563, 565 (Fla. 4th DCA 2011); *Sheriff v. State,* 780 So.2d 920,
921 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). The offense of conspiracy may be proved by
circumstantial evidence. In *Vasquez v. State,* 111 So.8d 273, 275 (Fla.
2nd DCA 2013), the Second District stated as follows:

> A conspiracy exists where there is an express or implied agreement
> between two or more persons to commit a criminal offense and an
> intention to commit the offense. *Schlicher v. State,* 13 So.3d 515,
> 517 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). The fact-finder may infer the agreement from
> the circumstances; direct proof is not necessary.

**\[ ... \]**

We agree with Perry that no direct proof was introduced below of an
agreement between Perry and his wife or mother-in-law for the commission
of a sexual battery. Further, the circumstantial evidence in the record
is not sufficient to establish the existence of an agreement or intent
to conspire.

Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and sentence for conspiracy and
remand for entry of a JOA on that count.

*Background*

This case arises from the sexual abuse of Christopher Perry's daughter,
E.P., by Robert Young. Complicit in the abuse of E.P. were Perry, Mary
Perry[^104] (Perry's wife and E.P.'s mother), and Patricia
Wol-oszynowski (Perry's mother-in-law and E.P.'s grandmother).

Perry met Robert Young in 1994, and the two formed a close friendship,
spending their days off together, and attending each other's family
events. In 2001, shortly before Perry married Mary Perry, E.P. was born.
By this time, Young was such an integral part of the Perry family that
he drove Mary Perry to the hospital when she gave birth to E.P. Mary
Perry described Young as almost a godfather to her children and as a
brother to Perry. Perry himself described Young as his brother, and
allowed his daughter E.P. to call Young "Uncle Robert." But the
relationship between Perry and Young was far more intimate than that of
brothers. Perry, Mary Perry, and Young participated in threesomes. And
unbeknownst to Perry, Mary Perry and Young had a long-term affair apart
from the threesomes.

In 2010, while the Perry family was living with Mary Perry's mother,
Patricia Woloszynowski, Young moved into the Perry home. Neither Perry
nor Mary Perry were working during this time; Young paid all of their
bills and provided transportation for the family. The Perry family was
financially dependent on Young.

When Young initially moved into the Perry home, he slept on the couch,
but he soon moved into E.P.'s bedroom and slept in the same bed as the
eight year-old little girl. The Perry home was extremely small, with
three bedrooms and one bathroom, all within a few feet of one another.
Perry and Mary Perry shared one bedroom. The grandmother and E.P.'s two
younger brothers shared the second bedroom. E.P. and Young shared the
third bedroom. Despite the fact that Perry and Mary Perry knew that
Young was a convicted sex offender, neither objected to Young sleeping
with E.P. Neither did they object to Young bathing their young daughter,
even though E.P. was old enough to bathe herself and was capable of
doing so.

In November 2010, the Department of Children and Families received an
alert about E.P. sleeping in the same bed as an uncle. When confronted
by the DCF investigator, Perry and Mary Perry denied that Young was
sleeping in E.P.'s bedroom and further denied that any of their children
were left alone \"with Young. After the investigator prepared a safety
plan to protect the Perry children from sexual abuse, Perry and Mary
signed the safety plan, affirmatively agreeing that \'none of the
children would have unsupervised contact with Young. However, despite
their promise to investigators, Perry and Mary Perry continued to allow
Young, a known sex offender, to sleep with their eight year-old
daughter.

In February 2011, the Department received another report of an adult
male sleeping in the same bed as E.P. When interviewed by a child
protection team investigator, E.P. admitted that Young was sleeping in
her bed and that her parents were aware of the sleeping arrangement. The
investigator and a detective observed a lock on the outside of E.P.'s
door. E.P. would later tell investigators that her parents locked the
door to her bedroom to keep her inside the room with Young. At a
follow-up interview, E.P. admitted that Young had penetrated her
vaginally and anally with his penis, that he forced her to perform oral
sex on him, and that he performed oral sex on her.

**\[ ... \]**

When confronted by investigators, Mary Perry admitted that she and Perry
never attempted to follow the safety plan put in place to protect the
Perry children from sexual abuse by Young. Mary testified that she
witnessed Young sexually abusing E.P., that she told Perry what she had
seen, and that neither of them took any action to prevent the
continuation of the abuse. Mary Perry further stated that she and Perry
concealed Young's actions from the Department during the investigation.
Mary Perry and Perry consistently denied to DCF investigators that Young
slept with their daughter and misled investigators by falsely stating
that Young was sleeping on the couch.

At trial, Perry continued to assert that Young never abused his
daughter. Perry denied that he knew that Young's prior sex offense was
for molesting Young's thirteen-year-old step-daughter, even after a
recorded interview of Perry making such an admission to a DCF
investigator was played for the jury. Perry admitted that he made the
conscious decision to lie to the authorities that were investigating the
allegations of sexual abuse. He stated that he did not believe the
allegations against Young because he had known Young for eighteen years
and he was like a brother to him.

Perry moved for judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiracy to
commit sexual battery, arguing that there was no evidence that he had
conspired with Mary Perry or Patricia Woloszynowski for the crime of
capital sexual battery to be committed. The trial court found that there
was sufficient evidence to allow this charge to go to the jury, and it
denied the motion.

**\[ ... \]**

I dissent from the majority's conclusion that the trial court should
have granted Perry's motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of
conspiracy to commit capital sexual battery. "A conspiracy exists where
there is an express or implied agreement between two or more persons to
commit a criminal offense and an intention to commit the offense. . The
fact-finder may infer the agreement from the circumstances; direct proof
is not necessary." *Vasquez v. State,* 111 So.3d 273, 275 (Fla. 2d DCA
2013) (internal citations omitted). Here, the State presented sufficient
evidence to establish an implied agreement between Perry and his wife,
Mary Perry, to commit the offense of capital sexual battery.

There was no dispute that Perry and Mary Perry were aware that Young was
a convicted sex offender. The State presented evidence to show that
Perry knew that the conviction stemmed from Young's molestation of his
thirteen-year-old stepdaughter. Despite this knowledge, Perry and Mary
Perry consciously agreed to allow Young to sleep in the same bed as
their eight-year-old daughter, rather than requiring him to sleep on the
couch or in another bedroom. The State presented evidence that Mary
Perry witnessed Young sexually abusing E.P., that she told Perry what
she had seen, and that neither of them took any action to prevent the
continuation of the abuse or to even confront Young. In fact, when Perry
and Mary Perry were interviewed by investigators from the Department of
Children and Families, they gave identical false statements on more than
one occasion where they both denied to investigators that Young was
sleeping in the same bed as E.P.; rather, they both insisted that Young
had been sleeping on the couch. Their agreement to not disclose the
actual sleeping arrangements prevented the removal of E.P. and her
siblings from the home at an earlier date, which could have prevented
additional sexual abuse to E.P.

Further, due to the investigators' concerns about Young sexually abusing
E.P., the Department presented Perry and Mary Perry with child safety
plans designed to minimize the risk of sexual abuse by requiring no
unsupervised contact between Young and the Perry children. Perry and
Mary Perry both confirmed in writing that they would not allow Young to
have unsupervised contact with their children and promised that Young
would not sleep in the same bed as E.P. However, both Perry and Mary
Perry willfully disregarded the plan and allowed Young to continue to
sleep in the same bed as E.P. and to continue to bathe her. They did
nothing to prevent the continued abuse of E.P. Indeed, Perry and Mary
Perry went so far as to lock E.P. in her bedroom with the convicted sex
offender.

The jury heard testimony that the Per-rys were financially dependent on
Young. The Perrys were unemployed and Young paid for their utilities,
cell phone, Internet access, and furniture. The jury also heard
testimony about the long-term and close friendship between Young and the
Perrys. The jury heard about the sexual relationships between Perry,
Mary Perry, and Young. Thus, there was ample evidence before the jury to
suggest why Perry and Mary Perry might conspire to conceal the abuse of
their daughter by Young.

When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State,
these collective actions provide strong evidence of a tacit agreement
between Perry and Mary Perry to allow Young to have unrestricted access
to their eight-year-old daughter and to actively conceal Young's abuse
of E.P. Moreover, the lies to the child protection investigators by
Perry and Mary Perry were overt acts in furtherance of the charged
conspiracy. *See Melahn v. State,* 843 So.2d 929, 930 (Fla. 5th DCA
2003) (holding that "\[cjertain falsehoods told to an officer seeking
information, which go beyond merely disavowing knowledge or refusing to
cooperate with an investigation," may constitute an overt act). Under
these facts, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for
judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count because the jury could
infer from the above-described circumstances that Perry and Mary engaged
in a conspiracy to commit the offense of capital sexual battery of E.P.
For these reasons, I would affirm the trial court's judgment on all
counts.

People v Reyes

 

 

People v Reyes

Decided on February 15, 2018 NY Court of Appeals . . .

 

The order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be
affirmed. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People
(see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621 \[1983\]), we conclude that the
evidence is legally insufficient to support the conviction of conspiracy
in the second degree (Penal Law § 105.15) because \"there is \[no\]
valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational
jury could have found the element\[\] of \[agreement to a conspiracy\]
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . ."

\"The elements of \[a\] conspiracy offense\" generally may be
characterized as: \"first, the \[purpose\] that a crime be performed;
and second, an agreement with another person to engage in or cause that
crime to be performed\" (William C. Donnino, Practice Commentaries,
McKinney\'s Cons Laws of NY, Book 38, Penal Law § 105.00). Indeed, \"it
is fundamental that \[to\] be convicted of conspiracy\" (People v
Berkowitz, 50 NY2d 333, 343 \[1980\]) \"the defendant \[must\] enter\[\]
into a criminal agreement with at least one other person\" (People v
Treuber, 64 NY2d 817, 818 \[1985\]). \" . . .

Here, at the core of the People\'s case is evidence of defendant\'s
presence at various gang meetings at which the crime intended was
discussed by gang members other than defendant. Under the circumstances
of this case, to conclude that defendant\'s presence at such gatherings
alone was sufficient to establish agreement to join a plot would be to
equate his passive act of \"being present\" with the affirmative act of
\"agreeing\" to engage in a criminal conspiracy discussed at those
assemblies. The law does not contain a presumption of agreement based on
sheer presence at a meeting at which a conspiracy is discussed (see
Penal Law § 105.00 et seq.), and we share the view of the federal courts
that mere \"\[k\]nowledge of the existence and goals of a conspiracy
does not itself make one a coconspirator\" . . .

In so concluding, we are careful not to fix boundaries with respect to
the circumstances that may give rise to an agreement. Conspiracy is
criminalized to \"protect society from the dangers of concerted criminal
activity\" (United States v Feola, 420 US 671, 693 \[1975\]), the very
nature of which does not lend itself to transparency. Whereas an
agreement in a business context may be manifested with precision,
namely, through a contract, a correspondence, or conspicuous dialogue,
an agreement in the criminal realm typically would result from more
clandestine and ambiguous activity.

Consequently, we decline to define --- and therefore to limit --- the
circumstances giving rise to an agreement. On this record, however, we
agree with the Appellate Division that there is no valid line of
reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational jury could
have found the element of agreement beyond a reasonable doubt.

GARCIA, J. (dissenting):

Defendant, a member of the Almighty Latin King Nation, was charged with
conspiracy in the second degree in connection with an arson carried out
by other gang members. His trial lasted three months. Two gang members
testified pursuant to cooperation agreements. The intended victim of the
arson attack --- a former member of the gang --- also testified. The
People introduced evidence of defendant\'s knowledge of the conspiracy
and his agreement to cause or carry out its criminal purpose. Defendant
was convicted of conspiracy. I disagree with the majority\'s conclusion
that this evidence, considered under the appropriate standard of review,
was legally insufficient to support the verdict.

I.

\"A verdict is legally sufficient when, viewing the facts in a light
most favorable to the People, there is a valid line of reasoning and
permissible inferences from which a rational jury could have found the
elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt\" (People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349 \[2007\] \[internal citations and quotations
omitted\]). . .

The core of the conspiracy is the element of agreement, which will be
found where there is a \"concrete and unambiguous expression of each
actor\'s intent to violate the law\" . . .

On March 1, 2010, members of the Borough Park Homicide tribe (BPH) of
the Latin Kings firebombed the home of Juan Kuang. Defendant did not
participate in the March 1 attack but was instead charged with
conspiring to commit this act of arson. It is undisputed that the
defendant was a member of BPH. The only issue is whether the evidence,
viewed in a light most favorable to the People, was sufficient to
establish that he entered into an agreement with his fellow gang members
to commit this particular crime.

To properly evaluate the proof in this case, it is crucial to understand
what led to the March 1 attack. In 2009, Kuang --- a member of BPH ---
violated gang rules by dating a Latin Queen affiliated with a rival
tribe. BPH\'s leaders ordered him to either end the relationship or have
her join BPH. Instead, Kuang quit the gang, a violation of gang rules
that called for severe punishment. As a result, members of BPH began
harassing Kuang and his family, leading to escalating violence.

The People put in proof of the following: (1) the BPH leadership
structure and the roles and responsibilities of gang members; (2)
defendant\'s membership in BPH; (3) defendant\'s participation in an
earlier attack on a different residence associated with Kuang; and (4)
defendant\'s attendance at several meetings during which the proposed
arson attack was discussed and planned. Together, this proof was
sufficient to support the jury\'s verdict.

The victim and the two cooperating gang members testified concerning the
detailed leadership structure and internal security apparatus of the
gang. All BPH members who are not a part of the leadership structure are
considered \"body members\" and must attend weekly meetings, pay dues,
pledge loyalty to the gang, and carry out missions on behalf of the
gang. If a gang member violates a gang rule, they receive a beating. If
the gang member leaves the gang, the members will either \"beat you down
or if they can\'t get you, they will get to your family.\" Defendant was
a Latin King for at least two years prior to his arrest.

As a response to Kuang\'s perceived disloyalty to BPH, in February 2010,
on at least one occasion, gang members attacked a residence associated
with Kuang and his family. At some point, a group of BPH members went to
this residence where some members threw rocks and other items at the
house. Defendant himself told the police in a post-arrest statement that
he went to this residence with other gang members who threw \"rocks,
bottles\[,\] buckets, pretty much anything they could find to throw and
create damage to the house.\" A group of BPH members subsequently threw
Molotov cocktails at the windows, although the bottles apparently did
not break through the glass. One of the cooperating witnesses at
defendant\'s trial testified that defendant was part of that group.
Though defendant was not charged with any crimes relating to that
attempted arson, the jury was permitted to consider the testimony as
proof of defendant\'s agreement in the conspiracy with which he was
charged.

Later in February 2010, in response to the earlier attacks, Kuang
stabbed a member of BPH --- the brother of the gang\'s president.
Following the stabbing, the leader of BPH called an emergency meeting in
Prospect Park to discuss a retaliatory mission. At that meeting, gang
leaders informed the members that the mission would occur that night and
would involve throwing Molotov cocktails into Kuang\'s home. Members
were selected for the mission but defendant was not chosen. Over the
course of the day, two other meetings took place during which there was
some discussion of the upcoming mission to firebomb Kuang\'s apartment.
At one of these meetings, there was a discussion about the failure of
the prior attempt to firebomb an apartment associated with Kuang, but a
gang leader insisted that although \"that wasn\'t done properly,\" he
knew \"what to do now to make it complete.\"

Defendant was arrested prior to the actual firebombing and claimed
responsibility for the attack --- placing himself at the scene of the
crime --- but also stating he \"was part of something but didn\'t do
it.\" Given the timing of his arrest, defendant\'s claim that he was
present was not true. But it is just as clear from his post-arrest
statements that he knew significant details about the planned arson
prior to its execution.

I agree with the majority that defendant\'s presence at gang meetings
alone is insufficient to establish agreement. I also agree with the
general principle that an individual\'s knowledge of the goals of a
conspiracy does not automatically make one a coconspirator. But the
proof in this case cannot be examined in isolation: mere membership in
the gang is not enough; mere knowledge of the plan is not enough; and a
false confession does not establish defendant\'s participation. Properly
marshaled as evidence, however, the proof was legally sufficient . . .

In gang-related conspiracy prosecutions, evidence of the defendant\'s
participation in a gang --- while on its own is insufficient to support
a conviction --- is useful \"to establish an agreement among the
subjects, the purpose of the conspiracy and knowledge on the part of
the\[\] defendant\[\]\" \[citations omitted\] Indeed, \"gang membership
can be key to establishing criminal intent or agreement to conspire\"
(United States v Sargent, 98 F3d 325, 328 \[7th Cir 1996\]).
Additionally, where \"the evidence establishes that a particular gang
has a specific illegal objective . . . evidence of gang membership may
help to link gang members to that objective\" \[citations omitted\]
Thus, \"a jury may infer the existence of an agreement\" from evidence
of coordination between conspirators \"for the accomplishment of a
criminal purpose\"

In this case, defendant, a sworn member of the Latin Kings, was charged
with a conspiracy directly related to enforcing the rules and
regulations governing gang membership and obligations. He admitted
participating in retaliatory violence aimed at a rogue gang member,
namely he stated he went with other Latin Kings to attack a residence
associated with that member. When the target retaliated, defendant
attended meetings --- as a Latin King --- during which the next, and
most serious, attack on the victim was extensively planned. He
demonstrated by his post-arrest claim of responsibility that he had
absorbed key details of that plan at those gang meetings.

This evidence supports a \"valid line of reasoning and permissible
inferences from which a rational jury could have found the element of
agreement proved beyond a reasonable doubt\" (majority op at 3). As the
jury did here. . .

Accordingly, I dissent, and would reverse the order of the Appellate
Division and remit for a weight of the evidence review.

**\*2207** Many cities across the American West face a homelessness
crisis. The causes are varied and complex, the appropriate public
**\*2208** policy responses perhaps no less so. Like many local
governments, the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, has pursued a multifaceted
approach. Recently, it adopted various policies aimed at "protecting the
rights, dignity\[,\] and private property of the homeless." App. 152. It
appointed a "homeless community liaison" officer charged with ensuring
the homeless receive information about "assistance programs and other
resources" available to them through the city and its local shelter.
*Id*., at 152--153; Brief for Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission as
*Amicus Curiae* 2--3. And it adopted certain restrictions against
encampments on public property. App. 155--156. The Ninth Circuit,
however, held that the Eighth Amendment\'s Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause barred that last measure. With support from States and cities
across the country, Grants Pass urged this Court to review the Ninth
Circuit\'s decision. We take up that task now.

I A

Some suggest that homelessness may be the "defining public health and
safety crisis in the western United States" today. [72 F.4th 868, 934
(CA9
2023)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2075522044&pubNum=0008173&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_8173_934&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_8173_934)
(Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). According to
the federal government, homelessness in this country has reached its
highest levels since the government began reporting data on the subject
in 2007. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Community
Planning & Development, T. de Sousa et al., The 2023 Annual Homeless
Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress 2--3 (2023). California alone is
home to around half of those in this Nation living without shelter on a
given night. *Id*., at 30. And each of the five States with the highest
rates of unsheltered homelessness in the country---California, Oregon,
Hawaii, Arizona, and Nevada---lies in the American West. *Id*., at 17.

Those experiencing homelessness may be as diverse as the Nation
itself---they are young and old and belong to all races and creeds.
People become homeless for a variety of reasons, too, many beyond their
control. Some have been affected by economic conditions, rising housing
costs, or natural disasters. *Id*., at 37; see Brief for United States
as *Amicus Curiae* 2--3. Some have been forced from their homes to
escape domestic violence and other forms of exploitation. *Ibid.* And
still others struggle with drug addiction and mental illness. By one
estimate, perhaps 78 percent of the unsheltered suffer from
mental-health issues, while 75 percent struggle with substance abuse.
See J. Rountree, N. Hess, & A. Lyke, Health Conditions Among Unsheltered
Adults in the U. S., Calif. Policy Lab, Policy Brief 5 (2019).

Those living without shelter often live together. L. Dunton et al.,
Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development &
Research, Exploring Homelessness Among People Living in Encampments and
Associated Cost 1 (2020) (2020 HUD Report). As the number of homeless
individuals has grown, the number of homeless encampments across the
country has increased as well, "in numbers not seen in almost a
century." *Ibid.* The unsheltered may coalesce in these encampments for
a range of reasons. Some value the "freedom" encampment living provides
compared with submitting to the rules shelters impose. Dept. of Housing
and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, R.
Cohen, W. Yetvin, & J. Khadduri, Understanding Encampments of People
Experiencing Homelessness and Community Responses 5 (2019). Others
report that encampments offer a "sense of community." *Id*., at 7. And
still others may seek them out for **\*2209** "dependable access to
illegal drugs." *Ibid.* In brief, the reasons why someone will go
without shelter on a given night vary widely by the person and by the
day. See *ibid*.

As the number and size of these encampments have grown, so have the
challenges they can pose for the homeless and others. We are told, for
example, that the "exponential increase in \... encampments in recent
years has resulted in an increase in crimes both against the homeless
and by the homeless." Brief for California State Sheriffs' Associations
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 21 (California Sheriffs Brief). California\'s
Governor reports that encampment inhabitants face heightened risks of
"sexual assault" and "subjugation to sex work." Brief for California
Governor G. Newsom as *Amicus Curiae* 11 (California Governor Brief).
And by one estimate, more than 40 percent of the shootings in Seattle in
early 2022 were linked to homeless encampments. Brief for Washington
State Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs as *Amicus Curiae* on
Pet. for Cert. 10 (Washington Sheriffs Brief).

Other challenges have arisen as well. Some city officials indicate that
encampments facilitate the distribution of drugs like heroin and
fentanyl, which have claimed the lives of so many Americans in recent
years. Brief for Office of the San Diego County District Attorney as
*Amicus Curiae* 17--19. Without running water or proper sanitation
facilities, too, diseases can sometimes spread in encampments and beyond
them. Various States say that they have seen
[typhus](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ic33f1dc0475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0),
shigella, trench fever, and other diseases reemerge on their city
streets. California Governor Brief 12; Brief for Idaho et al. as *Amici
Curiae* 7 (States Brief). . . .

Communities of all sizes are grappling with how best to address
challenges like these. As they have throughout the Nation\'s history,
charitable organizations "serve as the backbone of the emergency shelter
system in this country," accounting for roughly 40 percent of the
country\'s shelter beds for single adults on a given night. See National
Alliance To End Homelessness, Faith-Based Organizations: Fundamental
Partners in Ending Homelessness 1 (2017). Many private organizations,
city officials, and States have worked, as well, to increase the
availability of affordable housing in order to provide more permanent
shelter for those in need. See Brief for Local Government Legal Center
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 4, 32 (Cities Brief). But many, too, have come
to the conclusion that, as they put it, "\[j\]ust building more shelter
beds and public housing options is almost certainly not the answer by
itself." *Id*., at 11.

As many cities see it, even as they have expanded shelter capacity and
other public services, their unsheltered populations have continued to
grow. *Id*., at 9--11. The city of Seattle, for example, reports that
**\*2210** roughly 60 percent of its offers of shelter have been
rejected in a recent year. See *id*., at 28, and n. 26. Officials in
Portland, Oregon, indicate that, between April 2022 and January 2024,
over 70 percent of their approximately 3,500 offers of shelter beds to
homeless individuals were declined. Brief for League of Oregon Cities et
al. as *Amici Curiae* 5 (Oregon Cities Brief). Other cities tell us that
"the vast majority of their homeless populations are not actively
seeking shelter and refuse all services." Brief for Thirteen California
Cities as *Amici Curiae* 3. Surveys cited by the Department of Justice
suggest that only "25--41 percent" of "homeless encampment residents"
"willingly" accept offers of shelter beds. See Dept. of Justice, Office
of Community Oriented Policing Services, S. Chamard, Homeless
Encampments 36 (2010).

The reasons why the unsheltered sometimes reject offers of assistance
may themselves be many and complex. Some may reject shelter because
accepting it would take them further from family and local ties. See
Brief for 57 Social Scientists as *Amici Curiae* 20. Some may decline
offers of assistance because of concerns for their safety or the rules
some shelters impose regarding curfews, drug use, or religious
practices. *Id.*, at 22; see Cities Brief 29. Other factors may also be
at play. But whatever the causes, local governments say, this dynamic
significantly complicates their efforts to address the challenges of
homelessness. See *id*., at 11.

Rather than focus on a single policy to meet the challenges associated
with homelessness, many States and cities have pursued a range of
policies and programs. See 2020 HUD Report 14--20. Beyond expanding
shelter and affordable housing opportunities, some have reinvested in
mental-health and substance-abuse treatment programs. See Brief for
California State Association of Counties et al. as *Amici Curiae* 20,
25; see also 2020 HUD Report 23. Some have trained their employees in
outreach tactics designed to improve relations between governments and
the homeless they serve. *Ibid.* And still others have chosen to pair
these efforts with the enforcement of laws that restrict camping in
public places, like parks, streets, and sidewalks. Cities Brief 11.

Laws like those are commonplace. By one count, "a majority of cities
have laws restricting camping in public spaces," and nearly forty
percent "have one or more laws prohibiting camping citywide." See Brief
for Western Regional Advocacy Project as *Amicus Curiae* 7, n. 15
(emphasis deleted).

Different governments may use these laws in different ways and to
varying degrees. See Cities Brief 11. But many broadly agree that
"policymakers need access to the full panoply of tools in the policy
toolbox" to "tackle the complicated issues of housing and homelessness."

B

Five years ago, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took
one of those tools off the table. In [*Martin v. Boise*, 920 F.3d 584
(2019)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
that court considered a public-camping ordinance in Boise, Idaho, that
made it a misdemeanor to use "streets, sidewalks, parks, or public
places" for "camping." [*Id*., at
603](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_506_603&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_506_603)
(internal quotation marks omitted). According to the Ninth Circuit, the
Eighth Amendment\'s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause barred Boise
from enforcing its public-camping ordinance against homeless individuals
who lacked "access to alternative shelter." [*Id.*, at
615](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_506_615&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_506_615).
That "access" was lacking, the court said, whenever " 'there is a

injunction issued against the city of Grants Pass. Located on the banks
of the Rogue River in southwestern Oregon, the city is home to roughly
38,000 people. Among them are an estimated 600 individuals who
experience homelessness on a given day. [72 F.4th, at

Like many American cities, Grants Pass has laws restricting camping in
public spaces. Three are relevant here. The first prohibits sleeping "on
public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways." Grants Pass Municipal Code §
5.61.020(A) (2023); App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a. The second prohibits
"\[c\]amping" on public property. § 5.61.030; App. to Pet. for Cert.
222a (boldface deleted). Camping is defined as "set\[ting\] up \... or
remain\[ing\] in or at a campsite," and a "\[c\]ampsite" is defined as
"any place where bedding, sleeping bag\[s\], or other material used for
bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed \... for the purpose of
maintaining a temporary place to live." §§ 5.61.010(A)--(B); App. to
Pet. for Cert. 221a. The third prohibits "\[c\]amping" and
"\[o\]vernight parking" in the city\'s parks. §§ 6.46.090(A)--(B); [72
F.4th, at
876](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2075522044&pubNum=0008173&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_8173_876&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_8173_876).
Penalties for violating these ordinances escalate stepwise. An initial
violation may trigger a fine. §§ 1.36.010(I)--(J). Those who receive
multiple citations may be subject to an order barring them from city
parks for 30 days. § 6.46.350; App. to Pet. for Cert. 174a. And, in
turn, violations of those orders can constitute criminal trespass,
punishable by a maximum of 30 days in prison and a \$1,250 fine. [Ore.

two homeless individuals, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, filed suit
challenging the city\'s public-camping laws. App. 37, Third Amended
Complaint ¶¶6--7. They claimed, among other things, that the city\'s
ordinances violated the Eighth Amendment\'s Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause. *Id*., at 51, ¶66. And they **\*2214** sought to
pursue their claim on behalf of a class encompassing "all involuntarily
homeless people living in Grants Pass." *Id.*, at 48,
¶52.[^2^](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/12610-criminal-law/resources/1.13-city-of-grants-pass-oregon-v-johnson/#co_footnote_B00032080696162_1)

The district court certified the class action and enjoined the city from
enforcing its public-camping laws against the homeless. . . . \[T\]he
court found, everyone without shelter in Grants Pass was "involuntarily
homeless" because the city\'s total homeless population outnumbered its
" 'practically available' " shelter beds. App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a,
216a. In fact, the court ruled, none of the beds at Grants Pass\'s
charity-run shelter qualified as "available." They did not, the court
said, both because that shelter offers something closer to transitional
housing than "temporary emergency shelter," and because the shelter has
rules requiring residents to abstain from smoking and attend religious
services. *Id*., at 179a--180a. The Eighth Amendment, the district court
thus concluded, prohibited Grants Pass from enforcing its laws against
homeless individuals in the city. *Id*., at 182a--183a.

Grants Pass filed a petition for certiorari. A large number of States,
cities, and counties from across the Ninth Circuit and the country
joined Grants Pass in urging the Court to grant review to assess the

experiment. . .

II A

The Constitution and its Amendments impose a number of limits on what
governments in this country may declare to be criminal behavior and how
they may go about enforcing their criminal laws. Familiarly, the First
Amendment prohibits governments from using their criminal laws to
abridge the rights to speak, worship, assemble, petition, and exercise
the freedom of the press. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment prevents governments from adopting laws that invidiously
discriminate between persons. . .

But if many other constitutional provisions address what a government
may criminalize and how it may go about securing a conviction, the
Eighth Amendment\'s prohibition against "cruel and unusual punishments"
focuses on what happens next. That Clause "has always been considered,
and properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of punishment" a
government may "impos\[e\] for the violation of criminal statutes."
[*Powell v. Texas*, 392 U.S. 514, 531--532, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20 L.Ed.2d
1254
(1968)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_531&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_531)
(plurality opinion).

We have previously discussed the Clause\'s origins and meaning. In the
18th century, English law still "formally tolerated" certain barbaric
punishments like "disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and
burning alive," even though those practices had by then "fallen into
disuse." [*Bucklew v. Precythe*, 587 U.S. 119, 130, 139 S.Ct. 1112, 203
L.Ed.2d 521
(2019)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130)
(citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws **\*2216** of England
370 (1769) (Blackstone)). The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was
adopted to ensure that the new Nation would never resort to any of those
punishments or others like them. Punishments like those were "cruel"
because they were calculated to " 'superad\[d\]' " " 'terror, pain, or
disgrace.' " [587 U.S., at 130, 139 S.Ct. 1112 (quoting 4 Blackstone
370)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130).
And they were "unusual" because, by the time of the Amendment\'s
adoption, they had "long fallen out of use." [587 U.S., at 130, 139
S.Ct.
1112](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130).
. . .

All that would seem to make the Eighth Amendment a poor foundation on
which to rest the kind of decree the plaintiffs seek in this case and
the Ninth Circuit has endorsed since
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause focuses on the question what
"method or kind of punishment" a government may impose after a criminal
conviction, not on the question whether a government may criminalize
particular behavior in the first place or how it may go about securing a
conviction for that offense. [*Powell*, 392 U.S., at 531--532, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_531&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_531).
To the extent the Constitution speaks to those other matters, it does
so, as we have seen, in other provisions.

Nor, focusing on the criminal punishments Grant Pass imposes, can we say
they qualify as cruel and unusual. Recall that, under the city\'s
ordinances, an initial offense may trigger a civil fine. Repeat offenses
may trigger an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a
public park. Only those who later violate an order like that may face a
criminal punishment of up to 30 days in jail and a larger fine. See Part
I--C, *supra*. None of the city\'s sanctions qualifies as cruel because
none is designed to "superad\[d\]" "terror, pain, or disgrace."
[*Bucklew*, 587 U.S., at 130, 139 S.Ct.
1112](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130)

the plaintiffs and the dissent observe, this Court addressed a challenge
to a criminal conviction under a California statute providing that "
'\[n\]o person shall \... be addicted to the use of narcotics.' "
[*Ibid*., n.

In response to that challenge, the Court invoked the Cruel and Unusual

making "the 'status' of narcotic addiction a criminal offense." [*Id*.,

. . . \[T\]he Court read\[\] the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to
impose a limit not just on what punishments may follow a criminal
conviction but what a State may criminalize to begin with. It was a view
unprecedented in the history of the Court before 1962. In dissent,
Justice White lamented that the majority had embraced an "application of
'cruel and unusual punishment' so novel that" it could not possibly be
"ascribe\[d\] to the Framers of the Constitution." [370 U.S., at 689, 82

Rather than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions like
"occupy\[ing\] a campsite" on public property "for the purpose of
maintaining a temporary place to live." Grants Pass Municipal Code §§
5.61.030, 5.61.010; App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a--222a. Under the city\'s
laws, it makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless,
a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student who abandons
his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal
building. See Part I--C, *supra*; *Blake* v. *Grants Pass*, No.

jurisdictions across the country. See Part I--A, *supra*. And because

The problem is, this Court has already rejected that view. In [*Powell
v. Texas*, 392 U.S. 514, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20 L.Ed.2d 1254
(1968)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
the Court confronted a defendant who had been convicted under a Texas
statute making it a crime to " 'get drunk or be found in a state of
intoxication in any public place.' " [*Id*., at 517, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
(plurality opinion). Like the plaintiffs here, Mr. Powell argued that
his drunkenness was an " 'involuntary' " byproduct of his status as an
alcoholic. [*Id*., at 533, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Yes, the statute required proof of an act (becoming drunk or intoxicated
and then proceeding into public), and perhaps some associated mental
state (for presumably the defendant knew he was drinking and maybe even
knew he made his way to a public place). Still, Mr. Powell contended,
Texas\'s law effectively criminalized his status as an alcoholic because
he could not help but doing as he did.

The Court did not agree. Writing for a plurality, Justice Marshall
observed that

criminal law" "under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment\[s\]
Clause." [392 U.S., at 533, 88 S.Ct.

That small intrusion, Justice Marshall said, prevents States only from
enforcing laws that criminalize "a mere status." [*Id.*, at 532, 88

It does nothing to curtail a State\'s authority to secure a conviction

preventing." [*Id*., at 533, 88 S.Ct.

to "involuntary" acts, it stressed **\*2221** the dangers that would

But how are city officials and law enforcement officers to know what it
means to be "involuntarily" homeless, or whether any particular person
meets that standard? **\*2222** Posing the questions may be easy;
answering them is not. Is it enough that a homeless person has turned
down an offer of shelter? Or does it matter why? Cities routinely
confront individuals who decline offers of shelter for any number of
reasons, ranging from safety concerns to individual preferences. See
Part I--A, *supra*. How are cities and their law enforcement officers on
the ground to know which of these reasons are sufficiently weighty to
qualify a person as "involuntarily" homeless?

If there are answers to those questions, they cannot be found in the
Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. . . .

One federal court in Los Angeles ruled, during the COVID pandemic, that
"adequate" shelter must also include nursing staff, testing for
communicable diseases, and on-site security, among other things. See

and its progeny have "paralyzed" communities and prevented them from
implementing even policies designed to help the homeless while remaining
sensitive to the limits of their resources and the needs of other
citizens. Cities Cert. Brief 4 (boldface and capitalization deleted). .

Homelessness is complex. Its causes are many. So may be the public
policy responses required to address it. At bottom, the question this
case presents is whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges
primary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those
responses. It does not. Almost 200 years ago, a visitor to this country
remarked upon the "extreme skill with which the inhabitants of the
United States succeed in proposing a common object to the exertions of a
great many men, and in getting them voluntarily to pursue it." 2 A. de
Tocqueville, Democracy in America 129 (H. Reeve transl. 1961). If the
multitude of *amicus* briefs before us proves one thing, it is that the
American people are still at it. Through their voluntary associations
and charities, their elected representatives and appointed officials,
their police officers and mental health professionals, they display that
same energy and skill today in their efforts to address the complexities
of the homelessness challenge facing the most vulnerable among us.

Yes, people will disagree over which policy responses are best; they may
experiment with one set of approaches only to find later another set
works better; they may find certain responses more appropriate for some
communities than others. But in our democracy, that is their right. Nor
can a handful of federal judges begin to "match" the collective wisdom
the American people possess in deciding "how best to handle" a pressing
social question like homelessness. [*Robinson*, 370 U.S., at 689, 82
S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_689&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_689)
(White, J., dissenting). The Constitution\'s Eighth Amendment serves
many important functions, but it does not authorize federal judges to
wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in
their place dictate this Nation\'s homelessness policy. The judgment
below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

I join the Court\'s opinion in full because it correctly rejects the
respondents' claims under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. . .
.

\[T\]he respondents have not established that their claims implicate the
Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause in the first place. The challenged
ordinances are enforced through the imposition of civil fines and civil
park exclusion orders, as well as through criminal trespass charges.
But, "\[a\]t the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the word
'punishment' referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of a
crime." [*Helling v. McKinney*, 509 U.S. 25, 38, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125

Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. For some people, sleeping
outside is their only option. The City of Grants Pass jails and fines
those people for sleeping anywhere in public at any time, including in
their cars, if they use as little as a blanket to keep warm or a
rolled-up shirt as a pillow. For people with no access to shelter, that
punishes them for being homeless. That is unconscionable and
unconstitutional. Punishing people for their status is "cruel and
unusual" under the Eighth Amendment. See [*Robinson v. California*, 370
U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758
(1962)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Homelessness is a reality for too many Americans. On any given night,
over half a million people across the country lack a fixed, regular, and
adequate nighttime residence. Many do not have access to shelters and
are left to sleep in cars, sidewalks, parks, and other public places.
They experience homelessness due to complex and interconnected issues,
including crippling debt and stagnant wages; domestic and sexual abuse;
physical and psychiatric disabilities; and rising housing costs coupled
with declining affordable housing options.

At the same time, States and cities face immense challenges in
responding to homelessness. To address these challenges and provide for
public health and safety, local governments need wide latitude,
including to regulate when, where, and how homeless people sleep in
public. The decision below did, in fact, leave cities free to punish
"littering, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways,
possession or distribution of illicit substances, harassment, or
violence." App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a. The only question for the Court
today is whether the Constitution permits punishing homeless people with
no access to shelter for sleeping in public with as little as a blanket
to keep warm.

It is possible to acknowledge and balance the issues facing local
governments, the humanity and dignity of homeless people, and our
constitutional principles. Instead, the majority focuses almost
exclusively on the needs of local governments and leaves the most
vulnerable in our society with an impossible choice: Either stay awake
or be arrested. The Constitution provides a baseline of rights for all
Americans rich and poor, housed and unhoused. This Court must safeguard
those rights even when, and perhaps especially when, doing so is
uncomfortable or unpopular. Otherwise, "the words of the Constitution
become little more than good advice." [*Trop v. Dulles*, 356 U.S. 86,
104, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630
(1958)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1958121425&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_104&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_104)

The causes, consequences, and experiences of homelessness are complex
and **\*2229** interconnected. The majority paints a picture of "cities
across the American West" in "crisis" that are using criminalization as
a last resort. *Ante*, at 2207. That narrative then animates the
majority\'s reasoning. This account, however, fails to engage seriously
with the precipitating causes of homelessness, the damaging effects of
criminalization, and the myriad legitimate reasons people may lack or
decline shelter.

A

Over 600,000 people experience homelessness in America on any given
night, meaning that they lack "a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime
residence." Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, T. de Sousa et al.,
The 2023 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress 4 (2023 AHAR).
These people experience homelessness in different ways. Although 6 in 10
are able to secure shelter beds, the remaining 4 in 10 are unsheltered,
sleeping "in places not meant for human habitation," such as sidewalks,
abandoned buildings, bus or train stations, camping grounds, and parked
vehicles. See *id*., at 2. "Some sleep alone in public places, without
any physical structures (like tents or shacks) or connection to
services. Others stay in encampments, which generally refer to groups of
people living semipermanently in tents or other temporary structures in
a public space." Brief for California as *Amicus Curiae* 6 (California
Brief) (citation omitted). This is in part because there has been a
national "shortage of 188,000 shelter beds for individual adults." Brief
for Service Providers as *Amici Curiae* 8 (Service Providers Brief).

People become homeless for many reasons, including some beyond their
control. "\[S\]tagnant wages and the lack of affordable housing" can
mean some people are one unexpected medical bill away from being unable
to pay rent. Brief for Public Health Professionals and Organizations as
*Amici Curiae* 3. Every "\$100 increase in median rental price" is
"associated with about a 9 percent increase in the estimated
homelessness rate." GAO, A. Cackley, Homelessness: Better HUD Oversight
of Data Collection Could Improve Estimates of Homeless Populations 30
(GAO--20--433, 2020). Individuals with disabilities, immigrants, and
veterans face policies that increase housing instability. See California
Brief 7. Natural disasters also play a role, including in Oregon, where
increasing numbers of people "have lost housing because of climate
events such as extreme wildfires across the state, floods in the coastal
areas, \[and\] heavy snowstorms." 2023 AHAR 52. Further, "mental and
physical health challenges," and family and domestic "violence and
abuse" can be precipitating causes of homelessness. California Brief 7.

People experiencing homelessness are young and old, live in families and
as individuals, and belong to all races, cultures, and creeds. Given the
complex web of causes, it is unsurprising that the burdens of
homelessness fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable in our
society. People already in precarious positions with mental and physical
health, trauma, or abuse may have nowhere else to go if forced to leave
their homes. Veterans, victims of domestic violence, teenagers, and
people with disabilities are all at an increased risk of homelessness.
For veterans, "those with a history of mental health conditions,
including [post-traumatic stress
disorder](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ia99c9de5475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)
(PTSD) \... are at greater risk of homelessness." Brief for American
Psychiatric Association et al. as *Amici Curiae* 6. For women, almost
60% of those experiencing homelessness report that fleeing domestic
violence was the "immediate cause." Brief for Advocates for Survivors of
Gender-Based Violence as *Amici Curiae* 9. For young people, "family
dysfunction and rejection, **\*2230** sexual abuse, juvenile legal
system involvement, 'aging out' of the foster care system, and economic
hardship" make them particularly vulnerable to homelessness. Brief for
Juvenile Law Center et al. as *Amici Curiae* 2. For American Indians,
"policies of removal and resettlement in tribal lands" have caused
displacement, resulting in "a disproportionately high rate of housing
insecurity and unsheltered homelessness." Brief for StrongHearts Native
Helpline et al. as *Amici Curiae* 10, 24. For people with disabilities,
"\[l\]ess than 5% of housing in the United States is accessible for
moderate mobility disabilities, and less than 1% is accessible for
wheelchair use." Brief for Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 2 (Disability Rights Brief).

States and cities responding to the homelessness crisis face the
difficult task of addressing the underlying causes of homelessness while
also providing for public health and safety. This includes, for example,
dealing with the hazards posed by encampments, such as "a heightened
risk of disease associated with living outside without bathrooms or wash
basins," "deadly fires" from efforts to "prepare food and create heat
sources," violent crime, and drug distribution and abuse. California
Brief 12.

Local governments need flexibility in responding to homelessness with
effective and thoughtful solutions. See *infra*, at 2237 -- 2239. Almost
all of these policy solutions are beyond the scope of this case. The
only question here is whether the Constitution permits criminalizing
sleeping outside when there is nowhere else to go. That question is
increasingly relevant because many local governments have made
criminalization a frontline response to homelessness. "\[L\]ocal
measures to criminalize 'acts of living' " by "prohibit\[ing\] sleeping,
eating, sitting, or panhandling in public spaces" have recently
proliferated. U. S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, Searching Out
Solutions 1 (2012).

Criminalizing homelessness can cause a destabilizing cascade of harm.
"Rather than helping people to regain housing, obtain employment, or
access needed treatment and services, criminalization creates a costly
revolving door that circulates individuals experiencing homelessness
from the street to the criminal justice system and back." *Id*., at 6.
When a homeless person is arrested or separated from their property, for
example, "items frequently destroyed include personal documents needed
for accessing jobs, housing, and services such as IDs, driver\'s
licenses, financial documents, birth certificates, and benefits cards;
items required for work such as clothing and uniforms, bicycles, tools,
and computers; and irreplaceable mementos." Brief for 57 Social
Scientists as *Amici Curiae* 17--18 (Social Scientists Brief). Consider
Erin Spencer, a disabled Marine Corps veteran who stores items he uses
to make a living, such as tools and bike parts, in a cart. He was
arrested repeatedly for illegal lodging. Each time, his cart and
belongings were gone once he returned to the sidewalk. "\[T\]he massive
number of times the City or State has taken all I possess leaves me in a
vacuous déjà vu." Brief for National Coalition for Homeless Veterans et
al. as *Amici Curiae* 28.

Incarceration and warrants from unpaid fines can also result in the loss
of employment, benefits, and housing options. See Social Scientists
Brief 13, 17 (incarceration and warrants can lead to "termination of
federal health benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid,"
the "loss of a shelter bed," or disqualification from "public housing
and Section 8 vouchers"). Finally, **\*2231** criminalization can lead
homeless people to "avoid calling the police in the face of abuse or
theft for fear of eviction from public space." *Id*., at 27. Consider
the tragic story of a homeless woman "who was raped almost immediately
following a police move-along order that pushed her into an unfamiliar
area in the dead of night." *Id.,* at 26. She described her hesitation
in calling for help: "What\'s the point? If I called them, they would
have made all of us move \[again\]." *Ibid*.

For people with nowhere else to go, fines and jail time do not deter
behavior, reduce homelessness, or increase public safety. In one study,
91% of homeless people who were surveyed "reported remaining outdoors,
most often just moving two to three blocks away" when they received a
move-along order. *Id*., at 23. Police officers in these cities
recognize as much: " 'Look we\'re not really solving anybody\'s problem.
This is a big game of whack-a-mole.' " *Id*., at 24. Consider Jerry Lee,
a Grants Pass resident who sleeps in a van. Over the course of three
days, he was woken up and cited six times for "camping in the city
limits" just because he was sleeping in the van. App. 99 (capitalization
omitted). Lee left the van each time only to return later to sleep.
Police reports eventually noted that he "continues to disregard the city
ordinance and returns to the van to sleep as soon as police leave the
area. Dayshift needs to check on the van this morning and \... follow up
for tow." *Ibid*. (same).

Shelter beds that are available in theory may be practically unavailable
because of "restrictions based on gender, age, income, sexuality,
religious practice, curfews that conflict with employment obligations,
and time limits on stays." Social Scientists Brief 22. Studies have
shown, however, that the "vast majority of those who are unsheltered
would move inside if safe and affordable options were available."
Service Providers Brief 8 (collecting studies). Consider CarrieLynn
Hill. She cannot stay at Gospel Rescue Mission, the only entity in
Grants Pass offering temporary beds, because "she would have to check
her
[nebulizer](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=mdev&entityId=Ic14d11d7475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)
in as medical equipment and, though she must use it at least once every
four hours, would not be able to use it in her room." Disability Rights
Brief 18. Similarly, Debra Blake\'s "disabilities prevent her from
working, which means she cannot comply with the Gospel Rescue Mission\'s
requirement that its residents work 40-hour work weeks." *Ibid.*

Before I move on, consider one last example of a Nashville man who
experienced homelessness for nearly 20 years. When an outreach worker
tried to help him secure housing, the worker had difficulty finding him
for his appointments because he was frequently arrested for being
homeless. He was arrested 198 times and had over 250 charged citations,
all for petty offenses. The outreach worker made him a t-shirt that read
"Please do not arrest me, my outreach worker is working on my housing."
Service Providers Brief 16. Once the worker was able to secure him
stable housing, he "had no further encounters with the police, no
citations, and no arrests." *Ibid.*

These and countless other stories reflect the reality of criminalizing
sleeping outside when people have no other choice.

II

Grants Pass, a city of 38,000 people in southern Oregon, adopted three
ordinances (Ordinances) that effectively make it unlawful to sleep
anywhere in public, including in your car, at any time, with as little
as a blanket or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow. . . .

Respondents here, two longtime residents of Grants Pass who are homeless
and sleep in their cars, sued on behalf of themselves and all other
involuntarily homeless people in the City, seeking to enjoin enforcement
of the Ordinances. The District Court eventually certified a class and
granted summary judgment to respondents. "As was the case in
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
Grants Pass has far more homeless people than 'practically available'
shelter beds." App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a. The City had "zero emergency
shelter beds," and even counting the beds at the Gospel Rescue Mission
(GRM), which is "the only entity in Grants Pass that offers any sort of
temporary program for some class members," "GRM\'s 138 beds would not be
nearly enough to accommodate the at least 602 homeless individuals in
Grants Pass." *Id.*, at 179a--180a. Thus, "the only way for homeless
people to legally sleep on public property within the City is if they
lay on the ground with only the clothing on their backs and without
their items near them." *Id*., at 178a.

The District Court entered a narrow injunction. It concluded that Grants
Pass could "implement time and place restrictions for when homeless
individuals may use their belongings to keep warm and dry and when they
must have their belonging\[s\] packed up." *Id*., at 199a. The City
could also "ban the use of tents in public parks," as long as it did not
"ban people from using any bedding type materials to keep warm and dry
while they sleep." *Id*., **\*2233** at 199a--200a. Further, Grants Pass
could continue to "enforce laws that actually further public health and
safety, such as laws restricting littering, public urination or
defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or distribution of
illicit substances, harassment, or violence." *Id.,* at 200a. . . .

The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of "cruel and unusual
punishments." Amdt. 8 (Punishments Clause). . . .

In [*Robinson* v.
*California*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
this Court detailed one substantive limitation on criminal punishment.
Lawrence Robinson was convicted under a California statute for "
'be\[ing\] addicted to the use of narcotics' " and faced a mandatory
90-day jail sentence. [370 U.S., at 660, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_660&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_660).
The California statute did not "punis\[h\] a person for the use of
narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial or
disorderly behavior resulting from their administration." [*Id*., at
666, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Instead, it made "the 'status' of narcotic addiction a criminal offense,
for which the offender may be prosecuted 'at any time before he
reforms.' "
[*Ibid*.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))

The Court held that, because it criminalized the " 'status' of narcotic
addiction,"
[*ibid.*,](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
the California law "inflict\[ed\] a cruel and unusual punishment in
violation" of the Punishments Clause, [*id*., at 667, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Importantly, the Court did not limit that holding to the status of
narcotic addiction alone. It began by reasoning that the criminalization
of the "mentally ill, or a leper, or \[those\] afflicted with a
[venereal
disease](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ic8edbc8c475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)"
"would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and
unusual punishment." [*Id*., at 666, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
It extended that same reasoning to the status of being an addict,

Court did not rely on the harshness of the criminal penalty itself. It
understood that "imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a
punishment which is either cruel or unusual." [370 U.S., at 667, 82

Grants Pass\'s Ordinances criminalize being homeless. The status of
being homeless (lacking available shelter) is defined by the very
behavior singled out for punishment (sleeping outside). The majority
protests that the Ordinances "do not criminalize mere status." *Ante,*
at 2218. Saying so does not make it so. Every shred of evidence points
the other way. The Ordinances' purpose, text, and enforcement confirm
that they target status, not conduct. For someone with no available
shelter, the only way to comply with the Ordinances is to leave Grants
Pass altogether. . . .

Put another way, the Ordinances single out for punishment the activities
that define the status of being homeless. By most definitions, homeless
individuals are those that lack "a fixed, regular, and adequate
nighttime residence." [42 U.S.C. §
11434a(2)(A)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=42USCAS11434A&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_64eb0000ab9e4);

[578.3
(2023)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000547&cite=24CFRS578.3&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Permitting Grants Pass to criminalize sleeping outside with as little as
a blanket permits Grants Pass to criminalize homelessness. . . .

Take the respondents here, two longtime homeless residents of Grants
Pass who sleep in their cars. The Ordinances define "campsite" to
include "any vehicle." § 5.61.010(B). For respondents, the Ordinances as
applied do not criminalize any behavior or conduct related to
encampments (such as fires or tents). Instead, the Ordinances target
respondents' status as people without any other form of shelter. Under
the majority\'s logic, cities cannot criminalize the status of being
homeless, but they can criminalize the conduct that defines that status.
The Constitution cannot be evaded by such formalistic distinctions.

The Ordinances' definition of "campsite" creates a situation where
homeless people necessarily break the law just by existing. . . . Every
human needs to sleep at some point. Even if homeless people with no
available shelter options can exist for a few days in Grants Pass
without sleeping, they eventually must leave or be criminally punished.

The majority resists this understanding, arguing that the Ordinances
criminalize the conduct of being homeless in Grants Pass while sleeping
with as little as a blanket. Therefore, the argument goes, "\[r\]ather
than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions." *. . .* The
best the majority can muster is the following tautology: The Ordinances
criminalize conduct, not pure status, because they apply to conduct, not
status.

The flaw in this conclusion is evident. The majority countenances the
criminalization of status as long as the City tacks on an essential
bodily function---blinking, sleeping, eating, or breathing. That is just
another way to ban the person. By this logic, the majority would
conclude that the ordinance deemed unconstitutional in
[*Robinson*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
criminalizing "being an addict" would be constitutional if it
criminalized "being an addict and breathing." . . .

The Ordinances are enforced exactly as intended: to criminalize the
status of being **\*2237** homeless. City officials sought to use the
Ordinances to drive homeless people out of town. See *supra*, at 2234 --
2235. The message to homeless residents is clear. As Debra Blake, a
named plaintiff who passed away while this case was pending, see n. 1,
*supra*, shared:

"I have been repeatedly told by Grants Pass police that I must 'move
along' and that there is nowhere in Grants Pass that I can legally sit
or rest. I have been repeatedly awakened by Grants Pass police while
sleeping and told that I need to get up and move. I have been told by
Grants Pass police that I should leave town.

Because I have no choice but to live outside and have no place else to
go, I have gotten tickets, fines and have been criminally prosecuted for
being homeless." App. 180--181.

Debra Blake\'s heartbreaking message captures the cruelty of
criminalizing someone for their status: "I am afraid at all times in
Grants Pass that I could be arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for
sleeping outside or for covering myself with a blanket to stay warm."
*Id*., at 182. So, at times, when she could, Blake "slept outside of the
city." *Ibid.* Blake, who was disabled, unemployed, and elderly,
"owe\[d\] the City of Grants Pass more than \$5000 in fines for crimes
and violations related directly to \[her\] involuntary homelessness and
the fact that there is no affordable housing or emergency shelters in
Grants Pass where \[she could\] stay." *Ibid*.

. . .

The majority proclaims, with no citation, that "it makes no difference
whether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation
passing through town, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp
out in protest." *Ante,* at 2218. That describes a fantasy. In reality,
the deputy chief of police operations acknowledged that he was not aware
of "any non-homeless person ever getting a ticket for illegal camping in
Grants Pass." . . .

(Fortas, J., dissenting), and four Justices rejected that view. Justice
White, casting the decisive fifth vote, left the question open because
the defendant had "made no showing that he was unable to stay off the
streets on the night in question." [*Id*., at 554, 88 S.Ct.

(opinion concurring in judgment). So, in his view, it was "unnecessary
to pursue at this point the further definition of the circumstances or
the state of intoxication which might bar conviction of a chronic
alcoholic for being drunk in a public place." [*Id*., at 553, 88 S.Ct.

Court considered a statute that criminalized voluntary conduct (getting
drunk) that could be rendered involuntary by a status (alcoholism);
here, the Ordinances criminalize conduct (sleeping outside) that defines
a particular status (homelessness). So unlike the debate in

Even the Federal Government, which restricts some sleeping activities on
park lands, see *ante,* at 2210 -- 2211, has for nearly three decades
"taken the position that laws prohibiting sleeping in public at all
times and in all places violate the

States across the Nation. See Brief for Maryland et al. as *Amici

the table does not interfere with our ability to address homelessness
(including the effects of homelessness on surrounding communities) using
other policy tools, nor does it amount to an undue intrusion on state
sovereignty").

Nothing in today\'s decision prevents these States, cities, and counties
from declining to criminalize people for sleeping in public when they
have no available shelter. Indeed, although the majority describes
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
as adopting an unworkable rule, the elected representatives in Oregon
codified that very rule. See *infra*, at 2241 -- 2242. The majority does
these localities a disservice by ascribing to them a demand for
unfettered freedom to punish that many do not seek.

VI

The Court wrongly concludes that the Eighth Amendment permits Ordinances
that effectively criminalize being homeless. Grants Pass\'s Ordinances
may still raise a host of other legal issues. Perhaps recognizing the
untenable position it adopts, the majority stresses that "many
substantive legal protections and provisions of the Constitution may
have important roles to play when States and cities seek to enforce
their laws against the homeless." *Ante,* at 2224. That is true.
Although I do not prejudge the merits of these other issues, I detail
some here so that people experiencing homelessness and their advocates
do not take the Court\'s decision today as closing the door on such
claims.

\* \* \* . .

I remain hopeful that our society will come together "to address the
complexities of the homelessness challenge facing the most vulnerable
among us." *Ante,* at 2226. That responsibility is shared by those
vulnerable populations, the States and cities in which they reside, and
each and every one of us. "It is only after we begin to see a street as
*our* street, a public park as *our* park, a school as *our* school,
that we can become engaged citizens, dedicating our time and resources
for worthwhile causes." M. Desmond, Evicted: Property and Profit in the
American City 294 (2016).

This Court, too, has a role to play in faithfully enforcing the
Constitution to prohibit punishing the very existence of those without
shelter. I remain hopeful that someday in the near future, this Court
will play its role in safeguarding constitutional liberties for the most
vulnerable among us. Because the Court today abdicates that role, I
respectfully dissent.

USUAL CRUELTY The New Sundown Towns (edited by Jocelyn Simonson

 

Tracy Rosenthal&nbsp;/ from the New Republic April 30, 2024

 

As Grants Pass, Oregon---and the nation---await a Supreme Court ruling
on just how far cities can police the homeless, a volunteer mayor and
her unhoused constituents try to weather the backlash.

\-\--

On July 24, 2018, Debra Blake was banished from every park in Grants
Pass, Oregon. She added the exclusion order to a growing pile of
violations---for sleeping, sitting, camping, and trespassing, a mix of
civil and criminal charges that accrued late fees, bench warrants, and
jail stints, wrecked her credit and job prospects, and made her a known
entity to police. At 59, Blake had lived in Grants Pass for almost 15
years, seven without a home. She didn't
[qualify](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.140855/gov.uscourts.ord.140855.1.0_1.pdf)
for a bed in the town's only shelter, and there was no place she could
legally rest outdoors. "It seemed like everywhere she camped she would
get tickets," a friend of hers told me. "Every night. Everywhere.
Anytime the cops caught her, she was in the wrong place."

In fall 2018, Blake
[sued](https://www.vox.com/2023/7/5/23778810/homelessness-california-unsheltered-research)
the city for violating her constitutional rights. Friends described her
to me as "motherly," "selfless," and "a force to be reckoned with." By
then, Blake owed the city \$4,000 in fines. "I am afraid at all times in
Grants Pass that I could be arrested, ticketed, and prosecuted for
sleeping outside or for covering myself with a blanket to stay warm,"
she testified in the lawsuit. She wasn't alone. "I have met dozens, if
not hundreds, of homeless people in Grants Pass," she said. "They have
all had similar experiences." In September 2019, her debt cresting
\$5,000, Blake was banished from the parks a second time. She sought
refuge beyond city limits, in places she feared were "not physically
safe ... far from food and other services."

Banishment of unhoused people was the point, her class-action suit
argued. Ahead of the tourist season in spring 2013, officials had held a
[roundtable](https://www.grantspassoregon.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Minutes/181?MOBILE=ON)
on the city's "vagrancy problems." Meeting minutes rehearse now-standard
talking points in our national homelessness crisis. A councilman
explained the utility of punishment: "Until the pain of staying the same
outweighs the pain of changing, people will not change." The deputy
police chief suggested a "sobering center" that would house people in "a
jail cell with steel doors." Other officials urged banning food
distribution ("If you stop feeding them, then they will stop coming")
and posting "zero tolerance" signs at all entrances to the city. Grants
Pass redesigned its municipal code to incorporate these ideas. "The
point," one councilman said, was "to make it uncomfortable enough for
them in our city so they will want to move on down the road."

Blake won her case. As Ed Johnson, Blake's
[lawyer](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2024/04/with-oregon-homelessness-case-headed-to-supreme-court-spotlight-falls-on-portland-lawyer-unhoused-people-in-grants-pass.html)
at the Oregon Law Center, told me, Grants Pass had managed to design a
"set of ordinances that made it illegal to survive on every inch of
public land 24 hours a day." In 2020, the Oregon District Court ruled
that the imposed fees were excessive, that exclusion orders violated due
process, and that blanket criminalization constituted cruel and unusual
punishment against those "engaging in the unavoidable, biological,
life-sustaining acts of sleeping and resting." Blake passed away before
she could see the results: an injunction that allows homeless people to
rest in Grants Pass parks for 24 hours at a time, as long as there is
nowhere else for them to go. Her friend said it felt as if unhoused
people "didn't have to hide anymore."

But the city appealed---all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Gripped
by a right-wing supermajority, that court has already

[urged](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/city-of-grants-pass-oregon-v-johnson/)
the court to take up the case. Their authors included business
improvement and sheriffs' associations, archconservative think tanks
like the Goldwater Institute, the liberal cities of San Francisco and
Los Angeles, and California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.

Homelessness policies that fail drive electoral success, and politicians
can claim an empty sidewalk---and an unsolved crisis---as a political
victory.

Now a town of fewer than 40,000 people may get to rewrite the scripts of
homelessness policy for the entire United States. When the court rules,
likely in late June, unhoused people could lose the Eighth Amendment as
a bulwark against widespread criminalization and encampment sweeps. But
Grants Pass's current practices, even under the injunction, suggest
cruelty is rarely unusual. The embattled Oregon town is a microcosm of
the drama now playing out among politicians, their constituents, and the
fast-growing number of people who live in public space. In this
bipartisan production, homelessness is portrayed as something police can
deter and rehabilitation can cure. Homelessness policies that fail drive
electoral success, and politicians can claim an empty sidewalk---and an
unsolved crisis---as a political victory.

Grants Pass's mayor, Sara Bristol, often wears an expression of amused
exasperation. The day we met, she'd tried to dispel a Facebook rumor
that nonprofit warming shelters would house undocumented immigrants. She
often finds herself disputing the claim that homeless people in town are
outsiders. Born in Grants Pass, not registered with either party,
Bristol was elected just as the injunction settled into place, turning
new clusters of tents---on green spaces abutting the Rogue River, on
muddy dirt by the ball fields, on the grass strip of a road
median---into Bristolvilles. In fall 2023, a group of residents
campaigned for her recall, gathering signatures under signs that read
TAKE BACK OUR PARKS. Bristol
[maintained](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/09/13/grants-pass-mayor-appears-survive-recall-election/)
her mandate.

...Over the last 20 years, Grants Pass nearly doubled in size. Almost a
third of renters spend [more than
half](https://www.kdrv.com/video/grants-pass-works-on-rent-burden/video_4d30577a-6418-5086-acd9-3fcfd1658a34.html)
their income on rent. The most recent "Point in Time" count logged more
than 500 homeless people, a number that the count's coordinator said was
certainly an underestimation, conducted at the height of winter, when
people seek shelter anywhere they can find it. Many don't want to be
found.

The city is an odd estuary of lawn-sign liberals and flag-flying
conservatives. During the 2020 uprisings against police violence, an
open-carry guard convened at the 140-foot American flag on Union Avenue,
[patrolling](https://scheerpost.com/2020/06/03/tiny-oregon-town-holds-armed-rally-to-defend-flag-against-feared-invasion/)
the roof of the local Baskin-Robbins. The county boasts the lowest
property taxes in the state and hosts two secessionist movements. . . .
Residents often pointed me to the legacy of the Ku Klux Klan. One
unhoused person I met told me his grandfather had been a wizard.

The first time Bristol used her power to break a City Council tie, she
voted to install portable toilets in the city's parks. Some residents
and officials warned the move would "encourage" homelessness, but,
Bristol said, "nobody's going to come live in Grants Pass, Oregon,
because they heard there's a Porta Potty in Riverside Park."
Nonetheless, that "if you build it, they will come" fear has suffused
public comment periods, inspired town ordinances, and compromised
resources from the state. When the Oregon legislature
[earmarked](https://josephinedemocrats.org/commissioners-attack-grants-pass-mayor-for-trying-to-get-homeless-funds/)
\$200 million for homelessness, county supervisors refused to issue a
required "state of emergency" declaration or send in an application for
the funds.

"Public health, mental health, housing services are not things that the
city of Grants Pass provide, but we do have parks," Bristol said. "The
city doesn't want our parks to become homeless camps." . . .
\[O\]rganizers continue to protest at the parks. Vigilantes honk their
horns, throw trash, and yell "carp," meaning "bottom-feeders," from
their cars. Residents circulate photos of unhoused people on social
media; one Facebook group promotes citizens taking matters into their
own hands, even "final answers." Bristol suggested I contact David
Dapper. She did not mention that, in 2021, Dapper had been arrested at
Tussing Park for pointing a gun at unhoused people, including one
pregnant woman, and
[firing](https://kobi5.com/news/married-couple-arrested-after-shots-fired-in-grants-pass-park-police-say-151514/)
into the air.

Laws targeting the homeless have surged alongside homelessness itself:
The number of bans on camping, resting, standing around, and asking for
money all [just about
doubled](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/AG-2021/06-08_Criminalization-of-Homelessness.pdf)
between 2006 and 2019. But some laws have been
[overturned](https://homelesslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Housing-Not-Handcuffs-Litigation-Manual.pdf)
by the courts. Lawyers leveraged the First Amendment to protect
panhandling and handing out food; the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments
to prevent belongings from getting destroyed in sweeps. The United
States Constitution, Shayla Myers of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los
Angeles said, "provides that last line of defense" for unhoused people's
civil liberties.

In September 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
issued a landmark ruling governing the Western United States, where more
than half of all unsheltered homeless people in the country reside. The
court
[determined](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/09/04/15-35845.pdf)
in *Martin v. Boise* that criminalizing the "involuntary ... unavoidable
consequence of being homeless," sleeping in public, when there was no
"adequate" alternative place to go, violated the Eighth Amendment's
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The district court and
appellate court rulings against the city of Grants Pass built on this
foundation. (After Debra Blake's death, the case was named *City of
Grants Pass v. Johnson* for another unhoused plaintiff, Gloria Johnson.)
The city's ordinances had attempted to distinguish the necessity
"sleeping" from voluntary "camping," the latter signaled by the presence
of anything that would separate a person from the elements, including a
tent, a bedroll, cardboard, or a blanket. But staying warm and dry, the
courts said, was as necessary as rest. The town's use of civil rather
than criminal penalties could not evade the amendment either.

. . . Theane Evangelis wrote in an email to me that Eighth Amendment
rulings "are harming the very people they purport to protect." A white
paper Evangelis co-wrote
[expands](https://www.gibsondunn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Evangelis-Hamburger-Breaking-the-Legal-Paralysis-Combatting-Californias-Homelessness-Crisis-After-Martin-v.-City-of-Boise-California-Real-Property-Journal-July-2021.pdf)
on this view: Camping bans are "decades-old, ordinary, municipal laws"
that prevent the spread of encampments, incubators of deadly diseases
and drug use that victimize unhoused people and threaten surrounding
residents and businesses. The paper also highlights the "axiomatic"
function of anti-homeless laws as deterrence: Like laws against every
other criminal activity, the threat of punishment dissuades people from
living on the streets. Eighth Amendment rulings, by contrast, are an
invitation tantamount to "a constitutional right to camp in public."

But even under the rulings, the authors observed, cities are free to
issue time, manner, and place restrictions on people sleeping or camping
in public space. And the rulings have "no effect on laws prohibiting
drug dealing, violent criminal activity, and conduct that poses
environmental and health hazards."

...\[T\]here is often little daylight between Democrats and Republicans
in their efforts to engineer cities as sundown towns. It wasn't Idaho
where unhoused people first called on the Eighth Amendment to protect
themselves from criminalization; that distinction was California's. In a
2007 settlement, the court struck down 41.18, Los Angeles's "sit-lie"
law, a ban on sitting, sleeping, lying, and storing property in public.
San Francisco now boasts 24 unique anti-homeless laws. Recent reports
show unhoused people account for a disproportionate number of arrests,
even in liberal strongholds: one in six in L.A., and one in two in
Portland.

. . . Liberal cities met *Martin* not as an opportunity to diversify
their efforts to house people, but to creatively remove them within the
confines of the law. In 2021, Los Angeles
[updated](https://11thdistrict.com/4118-faq/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711327544811278&usg=AOvVaw1zNyPtyI43-Ev83JoU3WOH)
its sit-lie law with exclusion zones---around parks, schools, libraries,
underpasses, and shelters---which effectively if not technically
[blanket](https://antievictionmap.com/services-not-sweeps) the city.
Other cities responded to *Martin*'s demand that unhoused people need
"alternative" places to sleep before they can be ticketed or arrested by
codifying it into a cold calculus of beds versus tents. Both San Diego
and Las Vegas now issue misdemeanors for camping if shelter space
exists. "The right to shelter must be paired with the obligation to use
it," Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg has said. In other words,
unhoused people must accept shelter at the penalty of fines or
imprisonment.

Democrats have their own rhetoric of deterrence, a "tough love"
imbrication of coercion and care. Criminalization, San Francisco
explains in its brief in the *Grants Pass* case, is essential "to
encourage individuals ... to accept services." This model fastens the
stick of policing to the carrot of shelter and rehabilitation.
Punishment helps unhoused people make a choice that ultimately serves
them. One sociologist termed this approach "therapeutic policing."

But research shows that criminalization
[perpetuates](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/67/1/131/5422958?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)
rather than discourages homelessness, disqualifying unhoused people from
the support they need, including federal housing benefits. A criminal
record and credit scores wrecked by civil debt mean fewer employers or
landlords willing to give them a chance. In the short term, arrests and
sweeps interrupt the efforts of service providers. Unhoused people lose
medication, critical documents, survival gear, and fragile support
networks, losses that compound the physical and emotional toll of living
outdoors.

When voters demand action on homelessness, sweeps are a useful but
temporary fix; politicians keen to show progress on the issue resort to
shuffling the problem around. In two years, according to L.A.'s [own
data](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24453676/4118-efficacy-summary-report.pdf),
81 percent of encampments reemerged after "sit-lie" enforcement. In
Seattle, exclusion orders ultimately
[failed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286187988_Banished_The_New_Social_Control_in_Urban_America)
to prevent people from living in parks. In one San Francisco study, most
of the 350 homeless people interviewed said sweeps pushed them just a
few blocks away.

When sweeps fail, politicians blame the courts. In August 2023, Mayor
Breed
[joined](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-homeless-crisis-sweeps-lawsuit-aclu-breed-18310974.php)
a protest on the steps of the Ninth Circuit Court, decrying a recent
injunction, which found that the city would sweep, cite, and arrest
unhoused people when no alternative shelter existed to offer them; the
wait list for its shelters was 1,000 people long. Standing in front of a
sign that read DON'T RYUN SF (after Judge Donna Ryu, who issued the
order), Breed accused the courts of "micromanag\[ing\]" her efforts to
clear encampments. She was "sick and tired of being sick and tired," she
said, quoting civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer.

With a flurry of final, mostly neutral briefs sent to the court this
spring, liberal cities supported the *Grants Pass* case as a vehicle to
limit or clarify lower court rulings. San Francisco's brief demanded the
freedom "to enforce the will" of its voters. Los Angeles asked whether a
count of all homeless individuals is required every day before it can
enforce its laws. (The city has three times more unhoused people than
shelter beds.) Shayla Myers called these bids disingenuous, even
dangerous: No court has blocked anything besides blanket restrictions,
cities have ample room to say where unhoused people can be, and the
Supreme Court is in a frenzy of "overturning rights."

California's Governor Newsom sent his own plea that the court take the
case,
[admitting](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/15/gavin-newsom-interview-transcript-00116347)
it was a "hell of a statement for a progressive Democrat." His final,
neutral brief insists that he does not support the criminalization of
homelessness. But his warning that lower courts have erected a
"roadblock" that "hamstring\[s\]" cities echoes Grants Pass's own suit,
which uses the same words; Grants Pass's attorney, who says they've
"tied the hands" of officials; and the dissenting Ninth Circuit judge,
who
[wrote](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2023/07/9th-circuit-court-declines-to-rehear-ruling-that-upheld-homeless-right-to-sleep-outside-when-no-shelter-space-available.html)
that while *Martin* "handcuffed local jurisdictions," *Grants Pass*
"places them in a straitjacket."

"I'm in the cyclical hell that everyone else is in," John Babb told me.
That morning, his and every other tent in Baker Park had been
orange-tagged. Around 7 a.m., Grants Pass police made their twice-weekly
rounds, issuing notices to pack up and move. The "Public Notice of
Illegal Camping," printed on 8 x 10 orange copy paper, instructs
recipients, "Your campsite is subject to involuntary removal" 72 hours
after issuance.

A "compulsive rule follower," Babb had situated his tent strategically:
a dozen feet away from the banks of the Rogue River, far enough from
Department of Transportation property under the bridge and the two
"buffer zones" surrounding the paths on either side of him. I sat on a
thick navy blue poster board rolled out in front of his tent. Babb, in a
waffle-knit long sleeve and narrow black jeans, kept the door flap
around him like a shawl. The night's temperatures had dropped into the
20s, and the morning sun was only just breaking up the chill.

Despite her detractors' accusations of leniency, Mayor Bristol has
overseen a crackdown on encampments. Forcing houseless people to
relocate, Bristol said, "helps make it so that people don't have a sense
of permanency, like they own that square of the park." Even under the
injunction, the city can issue tickets for illegal camping with 24
hours' notice. In a nearly five-hour council meeting in June 2023, the
city introduced further rules. It prohibited "scattering rubbish," using
propane heaters, and public needle exchanges (which can
[halve](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/22/a-new-drug-war-in-oregon)
the spread of HIV and hepatitis C); it established "buffer zones" around
walkways and pavilions; and it limited park users to taking up a total
spatial footprint of eight feet by eight feet. Police had made rounds
sizing up tents to inform the decision: "Six by eight looked OK to me,"
the chief explained. "Ten by 10 did not look OK to me." Most violations
earn a ticket for \$295---\$537 if left unpaid. During public comment,
one resident argued: "Rights aren't given; they're earned with
responsibilities. Everybody has to earn their rights."

Two police officers, Tim Artoff and Jason McGinnis, make up Grants
Pass's Community Response Team, dedicated to enforcing the city's
ordinances at its parks. (Neither the officers nor the police chief
responded to interview requests.) Babb went to high school with Artoff,
whom Babb remembers with a mullet and acne. Every unhoused person I
talked to knew both officers by name. The entire Grants Pass police
force has fewer than 60 officers; about six are on patrol at a time. In
short, a full third of the city's resources for public safety---itself
almost a third of the city's budget---are directed to policing its
unhoused residents.

Babb had just passed his two-year anniversary of living outside. When he
lost both his parents, whom he called his "best friends," he couldn't
remain in the house they shared. Then the city impounded his car, and he
went from "cushy homeless" to living outdoors. Without the care of his
mother, he had to face the challenge of "learning to adult" at 52. Babb
was ambivalent about standing out in the community as "an English
major," an "Eskimo," and gay. People "go out of their way to paint
everyone with the same brush, like, 'Well, they just don't want to work.
They're useless drug addicts,'" he said. For the resources to stand up
for himself, he sometimes turned to Debra Blake's memory.

"With every fiber of my being, I know that I'm not going to be in this
circumstance forever," he said. But life outdoors puts up roadblocks to
getting out: "It's a vicious cycle.... It kind of compounds and
compounds." He has lost four IDs. Moving wears down his gear and
triggers his arthritis. His phone charger had been soaked through in a
recent storm---not that he could find somewhere to plug it in. The
city's ordinances, even under the injunction, erect their own obstacles.
"Two tickets. That's all I make in a year."

That morning, Babb had walked the half-mile to Riverside Park, where a
host of volunteers and nonprofits deliver the city's only services,
providing wound care and distributing groceries, gloves, and naloxone.
The city itself has restricted access to electricity, trash cans,
bathrooms, and running water at its parks. Asked about the specifics of
"scattering rubbish" violations, Artoff once said, "I don't know it by
heart.... It includes garbage and other items of personal property"---a
slippage between trash and houseless people's belongings. Of the
relentless cycle of sweeps, one person told me, "The cops run them
around like they're goddamn farm animals." People have to pick up
everything they own and move it between the only places they are allowed
to be---one pen to another.

Criminalizing homelessness is an increasingly organized effort on the
right. In 2021, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of the Palantir data analysis
company,
[bankrolled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/22/rights-war-housing-first-lands-middle-america/)
a camping ban in Austin. He helped establish the Cicero Institute to
take that campaign national. Already passed, introduced, or adapted in
12 states, Cicero's template legislation bans camping statewide---at the
penalty of a \$5,000 fine and a month in prison---and redirects all but
10 percent of homelessness funding from permanent to temporary housing,
with mandatory drug treatment. One policy director summarized the
strategy as "treatment first, not Housing First."

Ironically, the right is seeking to undo a framework popularized under
George W. Bush. Before Bush, federal policies prioritized short-term
shelter, offering permanent housing as a reward for sobriety and
employment. Housing First promised the opposite: unconditional,
permanent housing with voluntary mental health and substance care.
Appeasing fiscal and humanitarian concerns and once enjoying bipartisan
support, Housing First has been shown to use public resources
[efficiently](https://phys.org/news/2016-10-reveals-big-economic-benefits-housing.html)---housing
people costs less than repeatedly incarcerating and hospitalizing
them---and to keep people housed over the long term. The framework has
been adopted widely. It's the official policy of the state of California
and the Department of Veterans Affairs. It gets preference for federal
grants. But no level of government has built anywhere near enough
permanent housing to keep pace with the growing number of houseless
people.

. . . Cutting swiftly between shots of unhoused people in distress, a
video by the Cicero Institute and PragerU warns that cities with rising
homeless populations "have one policy in common: Housing First." It
makes the case that homelessness "is not a poverty problem.... The root
of the problem is mental illness and addiction." Rejecting, in
Lonsdale's
[words](https://www.city-journal.org/article/georgia-takes-a-stand-on-homeless-policy),
"the Marxist idea that American capitalism causes homelessness,"
conservatives insist that criminalization and mandatory treatment will
promote personal accountability and get people off the streets. . . .

Nationally, unhoused people with such problems are in the
[minority](https://www.samhsa.gov/blog/addressing-social-determinants-health-among-individuals-experiencing-homelessness):
21 percent struggle with a serious mental illness; 16 percent with
substance abuse. Studies reflect that forced treatment doesn't stop drug
use. Nor does drug treatment treat homelessness. Of almost 200,000
homeless people who entered substance treatment, one study demonstrated,
nearly 70 percent
[remained](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.202100430)
homeless afterward. Treatment programs will also prove difficult to
expand; they already face critical staff shortages.

. . . David Peery, who served as class representative of unhoused people
in a suit against the city of Miami, locates unhoused people's struggles
with addiction in the
[experience](https://www.vox.com/2023/7/5/23778810/homelessness-california-unsheltered-research)
of living outdoors: They turn to substances when it's too cold or
uncomfortable to sleep, for help staying awake when there's no place to
rest, or to address pain when they can't access medical care. Without
stable housing, they look for the predictability of a hit. Recently,
concerns about unhoused people's drug use fueled a backlash against a
2020 Oregon state measure that had decriminalized possession of small
amounts of illicit drugs. Accused of enabling addiction and encouraging
public disorder, the measure now sits on the governor's desk for repeal.

The concerns echo in Grants Pass. The Sobering Center that the city
planned in its vagrancy roundtable opened its doors in 2016. The
facility consists of 12 locked rooms, where people can stay for up to 24
hours. Almost half of its nightly inhabitants are placed there by the
police. The town's only shelter, the Gospel Rescue Mission, has a
zero-tolerance approach: sobriety from drugs, alcohol, even
[nicotine](https://gospelrescuemissiongp.org/i-need-help/); residents
have to quit smoking to qualify for one of the 138 beds. The
"pray-to-stay" facility's 29 rules also include attending church
services that follow the dictates of the "Apostles' Creed," not
interacting with members of the opposite sex, and presenting oneself in
line with one's "birth gender." (I am personally out on three counts.)
Residents must work 40 hours a week at the mission and can't look for a
job elsewhere. Executive director Brian Bouteller defends his shelter's
strict rules and advocates stricter enforcement at parks. In a recent
video, he describes people living in the parks as "can and won't": They
can leave homelessness but won't, because they are receiving "free
needles," meals, and medical care.

. . . Ignoring the systemic math of tattered social safety nets,
stagnant wages, and rising rents, politicians often frame homelessness
as an individual choice, even a "lifestyle." Homeless people are deemed
"service resistant" when they choose a tent over a space indoors, even
when that space is temporary or separates them from their community or
belongings. . . .

Behavioral modification is as old as the poorhouse, where residents were
forced to break rocks to earn a shelter bed. I often fear the future of
homelessness policy may look like a regression into that past. Palantir
co-founder Joe Lonsdale
[speaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3PSd0YLxDA) wistfully of the
terms "vagrants, bums, tramps." London Breed just won mandatory drug
treatment for welfare recipients, a policy revived from the Reagan
years. Gavin Newsom is bent on reopening the asylums, shuttered slowly
after John F. Kennedy's term. Housing First's right-wing detractors
exploit a 1950s playbook of assaults on public housing. . . . At its
most expansive, Housing First could do what public housing promised,
ensuring no one went without a home. But local opposition, chronic
underfunding, and eligibility requirements that invite only the most
visibly homeless indoors have reduced Housing First, Uppsala's Don
Mitchell said, to yet another "treatment program," treating the visible
symptoms of homelessness rather than the disease. What is languishing
may not be unhoused people in public space, but a sense of political
possibility, constrained by the effort it takes just to stop things from
getting worse.

Class 23: Justification; Self-defense

 

 

 

 

23.1

United States v. Peterson

 

United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit

157 U.S. App. D.C. 219, 483 F.2d 1222

No. 24299

1973-06-29

483 F.2d 1222

**\[ ... \]**

SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:

**\[ ... \]**

Self-defense, as a doctrine legally exonerating the taking of human
life, is as viable now as it was in Blackstone's time**\[ ... \]**. But
"\[t\]he law of self-defense is a law of necessity the right of
self-defense arises only when the necessity begins, and equally ends
with the necessity ; and never must the necessity be greater than when
the force employed defensively is deadly. The "necessity must bear all
semblance of reality, and appear to admit of no other alternative,
before taking life will be justifiable as excusable." Hinged on the
exigencies of self-preservation, the doctrine of homicidal self-defense
emerges from the body of the criminal law as a limited though important
exception to legal outlawry of the arena of self-help in the settlement
of potentially fatal personal conflicts.

So it is that necessity is the pervasive theme of the well defined
conditions which the law imposes on the right to kill or maim in
self-defense. There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the
use of deadly force against the defender. The threat must have been
unlawful and immediate. The defender must have believed that he was in
imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response
was necessary to save himself therefrom These beliefs must not only have
been honestly entertained, but also objectively reasonable in light of
the surrounding circumstances. It is clear that no less than a
concurrence of these elements will suffice.

People v. Goetz

 

New York Court of Appeals

68 N.Y.2d 96

1986-07-08

Argued May 28, 1986;

Chief Judge Wachtler.

A Grand Jury has indicted defendant on attempted murder, assault, and
other charges for having shot and wounded four youths on a New York City
subway train after one or two of the youths approached him and asked for
\$5. The lower courts, concluding that the prosecutor's charge to the
Grand Jury on the defense of justification was erroneous, have dismissed
the attempted murder, assault and weapons possession charges. We now
reverse and reinstate all counts of the indictment.

I.

The precise circumstances of the incident giving rise to the charges
against defendant are disputed, and ultimately it will be for a trial
jury to determine what occurred. We **\[ ... \]**have summarized the
facts as they appear from the evidence before the Grand Jury. We stress,
however, that we do not purport to reach any conclusions or holding as
to exactly what transpired or whether defendant is blameworthy. The
credibility of witnesses and the reasonableness of defendant's conduct
are to be resolved by the trial jury.

On Saturday afternoon, December 22, 1984, Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey,
James Ramseur, and Barry Allen boarded an IRT express subway train in
The Bronx and headed south toward lower Manhattan. **\[ ... \]**Two of
the four, Ramseur and Cabey, had screwdrivers inside their coats, which
they said were to be used to break into the coin boxes of video
machines.

Defendant Bernhard Goetz boarded this subway train at 14th Street in
Manhattan and sat down on a bench towards the rear section of the same
car occupied by the four youths. Goetz was carrying an unlicensed .38
caliber pistol loaded with five rounds of ammunition in a waistband
holster. **\[ ... \]**

Canty approached Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and stated
\"give me five dollars". Neither Canty nor any of the other youths
displayed a weapon. Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out his
handgun and firing four shots in rapid succession. The first shot hit
Canty in the chest; the second struck Allen in the back; the third went
through Ramseur's arm and into his left side; the fourth was fired at
Cabey, who apparently was then standing in the corner of the car, but
missed, deflecting instead off of a wall of the conductor's cab. After
Goetz briefly surveyed the scene around him, he fired another shot at
Cabey, who then was sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet
entered the rear of Cabey's side and severed his spinal cord.

All but two of the other passengers fled the car when, or immediately
after, the shots were fired. **\[ ... \]**The conductor then went into
the car where the shooting occurred and saw Goetz sitting on a bench,
the injured youths lying on the floor or slumped against a seat, and two
women who had *apparently* taken cover, also lying on the floor. Goetz
told the conductor that the four youths had tried to rob him.

**\[ ... \]**The train had stopped just before the Chambers Street
station and Goetz went between two of the cars, jumped onto the tracks
and fled. **\[ ... \]**Ramseur and Canty, initially listed in critical
condition, have fully recovered. Cabey remains paralyzed, and has
suffered some degree of brain damage.

On December 31, 1984, Goetz surrendered to police in Concord, New
Hampshire, identifying himself as the gunman being sought for the subway
shootings in New York nine days earlier. Later that day, after receiving
*Miranda* warnings, he made two lengthy statements, both of which were
tape recorded with his permission. In the statements, which are
substantially similar, Goetz admitted that he had been illegally
carrying a handgun in New York City for three years. He stated that he
had first purchased a gun in 1981 after he had been injured in a
mugging. Goetz also revealed that twice between 1981 and 1984 he had
successfully warded off assailants simply by displaying the pistol.

According to Goetz's statement, the first contact he had with the four
youths came when Canty, sitting or lying on the bench across from him,
asked \"how are you," to which he replied \"fine". Shortly thereafter,
Canty, followed by one of the other youths, walked over to the defendant
and stood to his left, while the other two youths remained to his right,
in the corner of the subway car. Canty then said \"give me five
dollars". Goetz stated that he knew from the smile on Canty's face that
they wanted to \"play with me". Although he was certain that none of the
youths had a gun, he had a fear, based on prior experiences, of being
\"maimed".

Goetz then established \"a pattern of fire," deciding specifically to
fire from left to right. His stated intention at that point was to
\"murder \[the four youths\], to hurt them, to make them suffer as much
as possible". When Canty again requested money, Goetz stood up, drew his
weapon, and began firing, aiming for the center of the body of each of
the four. Goetz recalled that the first two he shot \"tried to run
through the crowd \[but\] they had nowhere to run". Goetz then turned to
his right to \"go after the other two". One of these two \"tried to run
through the wall of the train, but \* \* \* he had**\[ ... \]**nowhere
to go". The other youth (Cabey) \"tried pretending that he wasn't with
\[the others\]" by standing still, holding on to one of the subway hand
straps, and not looking at Goetz. Goetz nonetheless fired his fourth
shot at him. He then ran back to the first two youths to make sure they
had been \"taken care of'. Seeing that they had both been shot, he spun
back to check on the latter two. Goetz noticed that the youth who had
been standing still was now sitting on a bench and seemed unhurt. As
Goetz told the police, \"I said *\'*\[y\]ou seem to be all right, here's
another' ", and he then fired the shot which severed Cabey's spinal
cord. Goetz added that \"if I was a little more under self-control**\[
... \]**I would have put the barrel against his forehead and fired." He
also admitted that \"if I had had more \[bullets\], I would have shot
them again, and again, and again."

II\.

**\[ ... \]**The matter was presented to a Grand Jury in January 1985,
with the prosecutor seeking an indictment for attempted murder, assault,
reckless endangerment, and criminal possession of a weapon. Neither the
defendant nor any of the wounded youths testified before this Grand
Jury. On January 25, 1985, the Grand Jury indicted defendant on one
count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Penal Law
§ 265.02), for possessing the gun used in the subway shootings, and two
counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal
Law § 265.01), for possessing two other guns in his apartment building.
It dismissed, however, the attempted murder and other charges stemming
from the shootings themselves.

Several weeks after the Grand Jury's action, the People, asserting that
they had newly available evidence, moved for an order authorizing them
to resubmit the dismissed charges to a second Grand Jury *(see,* CPL
190.75 \[3\]). Supreme Court, Criminal Term, after conducting an in
camera inquiry, granted the motion. Presentation of the case to the
second Grand Jury began on March 14, 1985. Two of the four youths, Canty
and Ramseur, testified. Among the other witnesses were four passengers
from the seventh car of the subway who had seen some portions of the
incident. Goetz again chose not to**\[ ... \]**testify, though the tapes
of his two statements were played for the grand jurors, as had been done
with the first Grand Jury.

On March 27, 1985, the second Grand Jury filed a 10-count indictment,
containing four charges of attempted murder (Penal Law §§ 110.00, 125.25
\[1\]), four charges of assault in the first degree (Penal Law § 120.10
\[1\]), one charge of reckless endangerment in the first degree (Penal
Law § 120.25), and one charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the
second degree (Penal Law § 265.03 \[possession of loaded firearm with
intent to use it unlawfully against another\]). **\[ ... \]**

On October 14, 1985, Goetz moved to dismiss the charges contained in the
second indictment alleging, among other things, that**\[ ... \]**the
prosecutor's instructions to that Grand Jury on the defense of
justification were erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant so as to
render its proceedings defective *(see,* CPL 210.20 \[1\] \[c\]; 210.35
\[5\]).

On November 25, 1985, while the motion to dismiss was pending before
Criminal Term, a column appeared in the *New York Daily News* containing
an interview which the columnist had conducted with Darryl Cabey the
previous day in Cabey's hospital room. The columnist claimed that Cabey
had told him in this interview that the other three youths had all
approached Goetz with the intention of robbing him. The day after the
column was published, a New York City police officer informed the
prosecutor that he had been one of the first police officers to enter
the subway car after the shootings, and that Canty had said to him \"we
were going to rob \[Goetz\]". The prosecutor immediately disclosed this
information to the court and to defense counsel, adding that this was
the first time his office had been told of this alleged statement and
that none of the police reports filed on the incident contained any such
information. Goetz then orally expanded his motion to**\[ ...
\]**dismiss, asserting that resubmission of the charges voted by the
second Grand Jury was required **\[ ... \]**because it appeared, from
this new information, that Ramseur and Canty had committed perjury.

In an order dated January 21, 1986, Criminal Term **\[ ... \]**dismissed
all counts of the second indictment, other than the reckless
endangerment charge**\[ ... \]**. The court, after inspection of the
Grand Jury minutes**\[ ... \]**held**\[ ... \]**that the prosecutor**\[
... \]**had erroneously introduced an objective element into this
defense by instructing the grand jurors to consider whether Goetz's
conduct was that of a \"reasonable man in \[Goetz's\] situation". The
court**\[ ... \]**concluded that the statutory test for whether the use
of deadly force is justified to protect a person should be wholly
subjective, focusing entirely on the defendant's state of mind when he
used such force. It concluded that dismissal was required for this error
because the justification issue was at the heart of the case.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X7fe6eaa4fb31964e744a80a1e2f581119487f6d)

**\[ ... \]**

On appeal by the People, a divided Appellate Division affirmed Criminal
Term's dismissal of the charges. The plurality opinion **\[ ...
\]**agreed **\[ ... \]**that the grand jurors should have been
instructed to consider only the defendant's subjective beliefs as to the
need to use deadly force. **\[ ... \]**

III\.

Penal Law article 35 recognizes the defense of justification, which
\"permits the use of force under certain circumstances" *(see, People v
McManus,* 67 NY2d 541, 545). One such set of circumstances pertains to
the use of force in defense of a person, encompassing both self-defense
and defense of a third person (Penal Law § 35.15). Penal Law § 35.15 (1)
sets forth the general principles governing all such uses of force:
\"\[a\] person may \* \* \* use physical force upon another person when
and to the extent he *reasonably believes* such to be necessary to
defend himself or a third person from what he *reasonably believes* to
be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other
person" (emphasis added).

Section 35.15 (2) sets forth further limitations on these general
principles with respect to the use of \"deadly physical force": \"A
person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under
circumstances specified in subdivision one unless (a) He *reasonably
believes* that such other person is using or about to use deadly
physical force **\[ ... \]** or (b) He *reasonably believes* that such
other person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping,
forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery" (emphasis added).

Thus, consistent with most justification provisions, Penal Law § 35.15
permits the use of deadly physical force only where requirements as to
triggering conditions and the necessity of a particular response are met
**\[ ... \]**. As to the triggering conditions, the statute requires
that the actor \"reasonably believes" that another person either is
using or about to use deadly physical force or is committing or
attempting to commit one of certain enumerated felonies, including
robbery. As to the need for the use of deadly physical force as a
response, the statute requires that the actor \"reasonably believes"
that such force is necessary to avert the perceived threat.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xdce0ea4552486f2a7c1cbcb473af8ed155843e6)

**\[ ... \]** The prosecutor properly instructed the grand jurors to
consider whether the use of deadly physical force was justified to
prevent either serious physical injury or a robbery**\[ ... \]**.

When the prosecutor had completed his charge, one of the grand jurors
asked for clarification of the term \"reasonably believes". The
prosecutor responded by instructing the grand jurors that they were to
consider the circumstances of the incident and determine \"whether the
defendant's conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant's
situation". It is this response by the prosecutor --- and specifically
his use of \"a reasonable man" --- which is the basis for the dismissal
of the charges by the lower courts. As expressed repeatedly in the
Appellate Division's plurality opinion, because section 35.15 uses the
term *\"he* reasonably believes", the appropriate test, according to
that court, is whether a defendant's beliefs and reactions were
\"reasonable *to him".* Under that reading of the statute, a jury which
believed a defendant's testimony that he felt that his own actions were
warranted and were reasonable would have to acquit him, regardless of
what anyone else in defendant's situation might have concluded. Such an
interpretation defies the ordinary meaning and significance of the term
\"reasonably" in a statute, and misconstrues the clear intent of the
Legislature, in enacting section 35.15, to retain an objective element
as part of any provision authorizing the use of deadly physical force.

Penal statutes in New York have long codified the right recognized at
common law to use deadly physical force, under appropriate
circumstances, in self-defense **\[ ... \]**. These provisions have
never required that an actor's belief as to the intention of another
person to inflict serious injury be correct in order for the use of
deadly force to be justified, but they have uniformly required that the
belief comport with an objective notion of reasonableness. **\[ ... \]**

The provisions of the Model Penal Code with respect to the use of deadly
force in self-defense reflect the position of its drafters that any
culpability which arises from a mistaken belief in the need to use such
force should be no greater than the culpability such a mistake would
give rise to if it were made with respect to an element of a crime **\[
... \]**. Accordingly, under Model Penal Code § 3.04 (2) (b), a
defendant charged with murder (or attempted murder) need only show that
he *\"believed\]* that \[the use of deadly force\] was necessary to
protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or
\[forcible\] sexual intercourse" to prevail on a self-defense claim
(emphasis added). If the defendant's belief was wrong, and was
recklessly, or negligently formed, however, he may be convicted of the
type of homicide charge requiring only a reckless or negligent, as the
case may be, criminal intent *(see,* Model Penal Code § 3.09 \[2\]; MPC
Commentaries, *op. cit.,* part I, at 32, 150).

The drafters of the Model Penal Code recognized that the wholly
subjective test set forth in section 3.04 differed from the existing law
in most States by its omission of any requirement of reasonableness
*(see,* MPC Commentaries, *op. cit.,* part I, at 35; LaFave & Scott,
Criminal Law § 53, at 393-394). **\[ ... \]**

New York did not follow the Model Penal Code's equation of a mistake as
to the need to use deadly force with a mistake negating an element of a
crime, choosing instead to use a single statutory section which would
provide either a complete defense or no defense at all to a defendant
charged with any crime involving the use of deadly force. The drafters
of the new Penal Law adopted in large part the structure and content of
Model Penal Code § 3.04, but, crucially, inserted the word \"reasonably"
before \"believes".

**\[ ... \]**Interpreting the statute to require only that the
defendant's belief was \"reasonable to *him, "* **\[ ... \]**would
hardly be different from requiring only a genuine belief; in either
case, the defendant's own perceptions could completely exonerate him
from any criminal liability.

**\[ ... \]**To completely exonerate such an individual, no matter how
aberrational or bizarre his thought patterns, would allow citizens to
set their own standards for the permissible use of force. It would also
allow a legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill or
perform acts of violence with impunity, contrary to fundamental
principles of justice and criminal law.

**\[ ... \]**

Statutes or rules of law requiring a person to act \"reasonably" or to
have a \"reasonable belief" uniformly prescribe conduct meeting an
objective standard measured with reference to how \"a reasonable person"
could have acted **\[ ... \]***.*

**\[ ... \]**

Goetz also argues that the introduction of an objective element will
preclude a jury from considering factors such as the prior experiences
of a given actor and thus, require it to make a determination of
\"reasonableness" without regard to the actual circumstances of a
particular incident. This argument, however, falsely presupposes that an
objective standard means that the background and other relevant
characteristics of a particular actor must be ignored. To the contrary,
we have frequently noted that a determination of reasonableness must be
based on the \"circumstances" facing a defendant or his \"situation"
**\[ ... \]***.* Such terms **\[ ... \]** bring in the physical
attributes of all persons involved, including the defendant.
Furthermore, the defendant's circumstances encompass any prior
experiences he had which could provide a reasonable basis for a belief
that another person's intentions were to injure or rob him or that the
use of deadly force was necessary under the circumstances.

Accordingly, a jury should be instructed to consider this**\[ ...
\]**type of evidence in weighing the defendant's actions. The jury must
first determine whether the defendant had the requisite beliefs under
section 35.15, that is, whether he believed deadly force was necessary
to avert the imminent use of deadly force or the commission of one of
the felonies enumerated therein. If the People do not prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he did not have such beliefs, then the jury must
also consider whether these beliefs were reasonable. The jury would have
to determine, in light of all the \"circumstances", as explicated above,
if a reasonable person could have had these beliefs.

The prosecutor's instruction to the second Grand Jury that it had to
determine whether, under the circumstances, Goetz's conduct was that of
a reasonable man in his situation was thus essentially an accurate
charge. It is true that the prosecutor did not elaborate on the meaning
of \"circumstances" or \"situation" and inform the grand jurors that
they could consider, for example, the prior experiences Goetz related in
his statement to the police. We have held, however, that a Grand Jury
need not be instructed on the law with the same degree of precision as
the petit jury **\[ ... \]**. This lesser standard is premised upon the
different functions of the Grand Jury and the petit jury: the former
determines whether sufficient evidence exists to accuse a person of a
crime and thereby subject him to criminal prosecution; the latter
ultimately determines the guilt or innocence of the accused, and may
convict only where the People have proven his guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt **\[ ... \]***.*

**\[ ... \]**Of course, **\[ ... \]**where the evidence suggests that a
complete defense such as justification may be present, the prosecutor
must charge the grand jurors on that defense, providing enough
information to enable them to determine whether the defense, in light of
the evidence, should preclude the criminal prosecution. The prosecutor
more than adequately fulfilled this obligation here. His instructions
**\[ ... \]** sufficiently apprised the**\[ ... \]**Grand Jury of the
existence and requirements of that defense to allow it to intelligently
decide that there is sufficient evidence tending to disprove
justification and necessitating a trial. The Grand Jury has indicted
Goetz. It will now be for the petit jury to decide whether the
prosecutor can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Goetz's reactions
were unreasonable and therefore excessive.

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and
the dismissed counts of the indictment reinstated.

MITCHELL, Justice.

The defendant was tried **\[ ... \]**upon a proper indictment charging
her with the first degree murder of her *husband*. The jury found the
defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The defendant appealed from
the trial court's judgment sentencing her to six years imprisonment.

**\[ ... \]**Notwithstanding the uncontroverted evidence that the
defendant shot her husband three times in the back of the head as he lay
sleeping in his bed, the Court of Appeals held that the defendant's
evidence that she exhibited what has come to be called "the battered
wife syndrome" entitled her to have the jury consider whether the
homicide was an act of perfect self-defense and, thus, not a legal
wrong.

We conclude that the evidence introduced in this case would not support
a finding that the defendant killed her husband due to a reasonable fear
of imminent death or great bodily harm, as is required before a
defendant is entitled to jury instructions concerning either perfect or
imperfect self-defense. Therefore, the trial court properly declined to
instruct the jury on the law relating to self-defense. **\[ ... \]**

At trial, the State presented the testimony of Deputy Sheriff R. H.
Epley of the Rutherford County Sheriffs Department, who was called to
the Norman residence on the night of 12 June 1985. Inside the home,
Epley found the defendant's husband, John Thomas Norman, lying on a bed
in a rear bedroom with his face toward the wall and his back toward the
middle of the room. He was dead, but blood was still coming from wounds
to the back of his head. A later autopsy revealed three gunshot wounds
to the head, two of which caused fatal brain injury. The autopsy also
revealed a .12 percent blood alcohol level in the victim's body.

**\[ ... \]**The defendant told Epley that her husband had been beating
her all day and had made her lie down on the floor while he slept on the
bed. After her husband fell asleep, the defendant carried her grandchild
to the defendant's mother's house. The defendant took a pistol from her
mother's purse and walked the short distance back to her home. She
pointed the pistol at the**\[ ... \]**back of her sleeping husband's
head, but it jammed the first time she tried to shoot him. She fixed the
gun and then shot her husband in the back of the head as he lay
sleeping. After one shot, she felt her husband's chest and determined
that he was still breathing and making sounds. She then shot him twice
more in the back of the head. The defendant told Epley that she killed
her husband because "she took all she was going to take from him so she
shot him."

The defendant presented evidence tending to show a long history of
physical and mental abuse by her husband due to his alcoholism. At the
time of the killing, the thirty-nine-year-old defendant and her husband
had been married almost twenty-five years and had several children. The
defendant testified that her husband had started drinking and abusing
her about five years after they were married. His physical abuse of her
consisted of frequent assaults that included slapping, punching and
kicking her, striking her with various objects, and throwing glasses,
beer bottles and other objects at her. The defendant described other
specific incidents of abuse, such as her husband putting her cigarettes
out on her, throwing hot coffee on her, breaking glass against her face
and crushing food on her face. Although the defendant did not present
evidence of ever having received medical treatment for any physical
injuries inflicted by her husband, she displayed several scars about her
face which she attributed to her husband's assaults.

The defendant's evidence also tended to show other indignities inflicted
upon her by her husband. Her evidence tended to show that her husband
did not work and forced her to make money by prostitution, and that he
made humor of that fact to family and friends. He would beat her if she
resisted going out to prostitute herself or if he was unsatisfied with
the amounts of money she made. He routinely called the defendant "dog,"
"bitch" and "whore," and on a few occasions made her eat pet food out of
the pets' bowls and bark like a dog. He often made her sleep on the
floor. At times, he deprived her of food and refused to let her get food
for the family. During those years of abuse, the defendant's husband
threatened numerous times to kill her and to maim her in various ways.

The defendant said her husband's abuse occurred only when he was
intoxicated, but that he would not give up drinking. She said she and
her husband "got along very well when he was sober," and that he was "a
good guy" when he was not drunk. She had accompanied her husband to the
local mental health center for sporadic counseling sessions for his
problem, but he continued to drink.

In the early morning hours on the day before his death, the defendant's
husband, who was intoxicated, went to a rest area off T85 near Kings
Mountain where the defendant was engaging in prostitution and assaulted
her. While driving home, he was stopped by a patrolman and jailed on a
charge of driving while impaired. After the defendant's mother got him
out of jail at the defendant's request later that morning, he resumed
his drinking and abuse of the defendant.

The defendant's evidence also tended to show that her husband seemed
angrier than ever after he was released from jail and that his abuse of
the defendant was more frequent. That evening, sheriffs deputies were
called to the Norman residence, and the defendant complained that her
husband had been beating her all day and she could not take it anymore.
The defendant was advised to file a complaint, but she said she was
afraid her husband would kill her if she had him arrested. The deputies
told her they needed a warrant before they could arrest her husband, and
they left the scene.

The deputies were called back less than an hour later after the
defendant had taken a bottle of pills. The defendant's husband cursed
her and called her names as she was attended by paramedics, and he told
them to let her die. A sheriffs deputy finally chased him back into his
house as the defendant was put into an ambulance. The defendant's
stomach was pumped at the local hospital, and she was sent home with her
mother.

While in the hospital, the defendant was visited by a therapist with
whom she discussed filing charges against her husband and having him
committed for treatment. Before the therapist left, the defendant agreed
to go to the mental health center the next day to discuss those
possibilities. The therapist testified at trial that the defendant
seemed depressed in the hospital, and that she expressed considerable
anger toward her husband. He**\[ ... \]**testified that the defendant
threatened a number of times that night to kill her husband and that she
said she should kill him "because of the things he had done to her."

The next day, the day she shot her husband, the defendant went to the
mental health center to talk about charges and possible commitment, and
she confronted her husband with that possibility. She testified that she
told her husband later that day: "J. T., straighten up. Quit drinking.
I'm going to have you committed to help you." She said her husband then
told her he would "see them coming" and would cut her throat before they
got to him.

The defendant also went to the social services office that day to seek
welfare benefits, but her husband followed her there, interrupted her
interview and made her go home with him. He continued his abuse of her,
threatening to kill and to maim her, slapping her, kicking her, and
throwing objects at her. At one point, he took her cigarette and put it
out on her, causing a small burn on her upper torso. He would not let
her eat or bring food into the house for their children.

That evening, the defendant and her husband went into their bedroom to
lie down, and he called her a "dog" and made her lie on the floor when
he lay down on the bed. Their daughter brought in her baby to leave with
the defendant, and the defendant's husband agreed to let her baby-sit.
After the defendant's husband fell asleep, the baby started crying and
the defendant took it to her mother's house so it would not wake up her
husband. She returned shortly with the pistol and killed her husband.

The defendant testified at trial that she was too afraid of her husband
to press charges against him or to leave him. She said that she had
temporarily left their home on several previous occasions, but he had
always found her, brought her home and beaten her. Asked why she killed
her husband, the defendant replied: "Because I was scared of him and I
knowed when he woke up, it was going to be the same thing, and I was
scared when he took me to the truck stop that night it was going to be
worse than he had ever been. I just couldn't take it no more. There
ain't no way, even if it means going to prison. It's better than living
in that. That's worse hell than anything."

The defendant and other witnesses testified that for years her husband
had frequently threatened to kill her and to maim her. When asked if she
believed those threats, the defendant replied: "Yes. I believed him; he
would, he would kill me if he got a chance. If he thought he wouldn't a
had to went to jail, he would a done it."

Two expert witnesses in forensic psychology and psychiatry who examined
the defendant after the shooting, Dr. William Tyson and Dr. Robert
Rollins, testified that the defendant fit the profile of battered wife
syndrome. This condition, they testified, is characterized by such abuse
and degradation that the battered wife comes to believe she is unable to
help herself and cannot expect help from anyone else. She believes that
she cannot escape the complete control of her husband and that he is
invulnerable to law enforcement and other sources of help.

Dr. Tyson, a psychologist, was asked his opinion as to whether, on 12
June 1985, "it appeared reasonably necessary for Judy Norman to shoot J.
T. Norman?" He replied: "I believe that . . . Mrs. Norman believed
herself to be doomed \... to a life of the worst kind of torture and
abuse, degradation that she had experienced over the years in a
progressive way; that it would only get worse, and that death was
inevitable . . . ." Dr. Tyson later added: "I think Judy Norman felt
that she had no choice, both in the protection of herself and her
family, but to engage, exhibit deadly force against Mr. Norman, and that
in so doing, she was sacrificing herself, both for herself and for her
family."

Dr. Rollins, who was the defendant's attending physician at Dorothea Dix
Hospital when she was sent there for evaluation, testified that in his
opinion the defendant was a typical abused spouse and that "\[s\]he saw
herself as powerless to deal with the situation, that there was no
alternative, no way she could escape it." Dr. Rollins was asked his
opinion as to whether "on June 12th, 1985, it appeared reasonably
necessary\'that Judy Norman would take the life of J. T. Norman?" Dr.
Rollins replied that in his opinion, "that course of action did appear
necessary to Mrs. Norman."

Based on the evidence that the defendant exhibited battered wife
syndrome, that she believed she could not escape her husband nor expect
help from others, that her husband had *threatened* her, and that her
*husband\'s* abuse of her had worsened in the two days preceding his
death, the Court of Appeals concluded that a jury reasonably could have
found that her killing of her husband was justified as an act of perfect
self-defense. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the nature of battered
wife syndrome is such that a jury could not be precluded from finding
the defendant killed her husband lawfully in perfect self-defense, even
though he was asleep when she killed him. We disagree.

The right to kill in self-defense is based on the necessity, real or
reasonably apparent, of killing an unlawful aggressor to save oneself
from *imminent* death or great bodily harm at his hands. *State v.
Gappins,* 320 N.C. 64, 357 S.E. 2d 654 (1987). Our law has recognized
that self-preservation under such circumstances springs from a primal
impulse and is an inherent right of natural law. *State v. Holland,* 193
N.C. 713, 718, 138 S.E. 8, 10 (1927).

In North Carolina, a defendant is entitled to have the jury consider
acquittal by reason of *perfect* self-defense when the evidence, viewed
in the light most favorable to the defendant, tends to show that at the
time of the killing it appeared to the defendant and she believed it to
be necessary to kill the decedent to save herself from imminent death or
great bodily harm. *State v. Gappins,* 320 N.C. at 71, 357 S.E. 2d at
659. That belief must be reasonable, however, in that the circumstances
as they appeared to the defendant would create such a belief in the mind
of a person of ordinary firmness. *Id.* Further, the defendant must not
have been the initial aggressor provoking the fatal confrontation. *Id.
A* killing in the proper exercise of the right of *perfect* self-defense
is always completely justified in law and constitutes no legal wrong.

Our law also recognizes an *imperfect* right of self-defense in certain
circumstances, including, for example, when the defendant is the initial
aggressor, but without intent to kill or to seriously injure the
decedent, and the decedent escalates the confrontation to a point where
it reasonably appears to the defendant to be necessary to kill the
decedent to save herself from imminent death or great bodily harm. **\[
... \]**Although the culpability of a defendant who kills in the
exercise of *imperfect* self-defense is reduced, such a defendant is
*not***\[ ... \]***justified,* in the killing so as to be entitled to
acquittal, but is guilty at least of voluntary manslaughter. **\[ ...
\]**

The defendant in the present case was not entitled to a jury instruction
on either perfect or imperfect self-defense. The trial court was not
required to instruct on *either* form of self-defense unless evidence
was introduced tending to show that at the time of the killing the
defendant reasonably believed herself to be confronted by circumstances
which necessitated her killing her husband to save herself from
*imminent* death or great bodily harm. *Id.* No such evidence was
introduced in this case, and it would have been error for the trial
court to instruct the jury on *either* perfect or imperfect
self-defense. **\[ ... \]**

The killing of another human being is the most extreme recourse to our
inherent right of self-preservation and can be justified in law only by
the utmost real or apparent necessity brought about by the decedent. For
that reason, our law of self-defense has required that a defendant
claiming that a homicide was justified and, as a result, inherently
lawful by reason of perfect self-defense must establish that she
reasonably believed at the time of the killing she otherwise would have
immediately suffered death or great bodily harm. Only if defendants are
required to show that they killed due to a reasonable belief that death
or great bodily harm was imminent can the justification for homicide
remain clearly and firmly rooted in necessity. The imminence requirement
ensures that deadly force will be used only where it is necessary as a
last resort in the exercise of the inherent right of self-preservation.
It also ensures that before a homicide is justified and, as a result,
not a legal wrong, it will be reliably determined that the defendant
reasonably believed that absent the use of deadly force, not only would
an unlawful attack have occurred, but also that the attack would have
caused death or great bodily harm. The law does not sanction the use of
deadly force to repel simple assaults. **\[ ... \]**

The term "imminent," as used to describe such perceived threats of death
or great bodily harm as will justify a homicide by reason of perfect
self-defense, has been defined as "immediate danger, such as must be
instantly met, such as cannot be guarded against by calling for the
assistance of others or the protection of the law." Black's Law
Dictionary 676 (5th ed. 1979). **\[ ... \]**

The evidence in this case did not tend to show that the defendant
reasonably believed that she was confronted by a threat of imminent
death or great bodily harm. The evidence tended to show that no harm was
"imminent" or about to happen to the defendant when she shot her
husband. The uncontroverted evidence was that her husband had been
asleep for some time when she walked to her mother's house, returned
with the pistol, fixed the pistol after it jammed and then shot her
husband three times in the back of the head. The defendant was not faced
with an instantaneous choice between killing her husband or being killed
or seriously injured. Instead, *all* of the evidence tended to show that
the defendant had ample time and opportunity to resort to other means of
preventing further abuse by her husband. There was no action underway by
the decedent from which the jury could have found that the defendant had
reasonable grounds to believe either that a felonious assault was
imminent or that it might result in her death or great bodily injury.
Additionally, no such action by the decedent had been underway
immediately prior to his falling asleep.

Faced with somewhat similar facts, we have previously held that a
defendant who believed himself to be threatened by the decedent was not
entitled to a jury instruction on either perfect or imperfect
self-defense when it was the defendant who went to the decedent and
initiated the final, fatal confrontation. *State v. Mize,* 316 N.C. 48,
340 S.E. 2d 439 (1986). In *Mize,* the decedent Joe McDonald was
reported to be looking for the defendant George Mize to get revenge for
Mize's alleged rape of McDonald's girl friend, which had exacerbated
existing animosity between Mize and McDonald. After hiding from McDonald
for most of the day, Mize finally went to McDonald's residence, woke him
up and then shot and killed him. Mize claimed that he feared McDonald
was going to kill him and that his killing of McDonald was in
self-defense. Rejecting Mize's argument that his jury should have been
instructed on self-defense, we stated:

> Here, although the victim had pursued defendant during the day
> approximately eight hours before the killing, defendant Mize was in no
> imminent danger while McDonald was at home asleep. When Mize went to
> McDonald's trailer with his shotgun, it was a new confrontation.
> Therefore, even if Mize believed it was necessary to kill McDonald to
> avoid his own imminent death, that belief was unreasonable.

316 N.C. at 53, 340 S.E. 2d at 442 (citations omitted). The same
reasoning applies in the present case.

**\[ ... \]**

Dr. Tyson additionally testified that the defendant "believed herself to
be doomed \... to a life of the worst kind of torture and abuse,
degradation that she had experienced over the years in a progressive
way; that it would only get worse, and that death was inevitable." Such
evidence of the defendant's speculative beliefs concerning her remote
and indefinite future, while indicating she had felt generally
threatened, did not tend to show that she killed in the belief ---
reasonable or otherwise --- that her husband presented a threat of
*imminent* death or great bodily harm. Under our law of self-defense, a
defendant's subjective belief of what might be "inevitable" at some
indefinite point in the future does not equate to what she believes to
be "imminent." **\[ ... \]**

The defendant testified that, "I knowed when he woke up, it was going to
be the same thing, and I was scared when he took me to the truck stop
that night it was going to be worse than he had ever been." She also
testified, when asked if she believed her husband's threats: "Yes. . . .
\[H\]e would kill me if he got a chance. If he thought he wouldn't a had
to went to jail, he would a done it." Testimony about such indefinite
fears concerning what her sleeping husband might do at some time in the
future did not tend to establish a fear --- reasonable or otherwise
---of *imminent death or great bodily harm* at the time of the killing.

We are not persuaded **\[ ... \]** that when there is evidence of
battered wife syndrome, neither an actual attack nor threat of attack by
the husband at the moment the wife uses deadly force is required to
justify the wife's killing of him in perfect self-defense. The Court**\[
... \]**of Appeals concluded that to impose such requirements would
ignore the "learned helplessness," meekness and other realities of
battered wife syndrome and would effectively preclude such women from
exercising their right of self-defense. **\[ ... \]**

The reasoning of our Court of Appeals in this case proposes to change
the established law of self-defense by giving the term "imminent" a
meaning substantially more indefinite and all-encompassing than its
present meaning. This would result in a substantial relaxation of the
requirement of real or apparent necessity to justify homicide. Such
reasoning proposes justifying the taking of human life not upon the
reasonable belief it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm
---which the imminence requirement ensures ---but upon purely subjective
speculation that the decedent probably would present a threat to life at
a future time and that the defendant would not be able to avoid the
predicted threat.

The Court of Appeals suggests that such speculation would have been
particularly reliable in the present case because the jury, based on the
evidence of the decedent's intensified abuse during the thirty-six hours
preceding his death, could have found that the decedent's passive state
at the time of his death was "but a momentary hiatus in a continuous
reign of terror by the decedent \[and\] the defendant merely took
advantage of her first opportunity to protect herself." 89 N.C. App. at
394, 366 S.E. 2d at 592. Requiring jury instructions on perfect
self-defense in such situations, however, would still tend to make
opportune homicide lawful as a result of mere subjective predictions of
indefinite future assaults and circumstances. Such predictions of future
assaults to justify the defendant's use of deadly force in this case
would be entirely speculative, because there was no evidence that her
husband had ever inflicted any harm upon her that approached
life-threatening injury, even during the "reign of terror." It is far
from clear in the defendant's poignant evidence that any abuse by the
decedent had ever involved the degree of physical threat required to
justify the defendant in using deadly force, even when those threats
were imminent. The use of deadly force in self-defense to prevent harm
other than death or great bodily harm is excessive as a matter of law.
*State v. Hunter,* 315 N.C. 371, 338 S.E. 2d 99 (1986).

As we have stated, stretching the law of self-defense to fit the facts
of this case would require changing the "imminent death or great bodily
harm" requirement to something substantially more indefinite than
previously required and would weaken our assurances that justification
for the taking of human life remains firmly rooted in real or apparent
necessity. That result in principle could not be limited to a few cases
decided on evidence as poignant as this. The relaxed requirements for
perfect self-defense proposed by our Court of Appeals would tend to
categorically legalize the opportune killing of abusive husbands by
their wives solely on the basis of the wives' testimony concerning their
subjective speculation as to the probability of future felonious
assaults by their husbands. Homicidal self-help would then become a
lawful solution, and perhaps the easiest and most effective solution, to
this problem. **\[ ... \]**

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the defendant's conviction
for voluntary manslaughter and the trial court's judgment sentencing her
to a six-year term of imprisonment were without error. Therefore, we
must reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals which awarded the
defendant a new trial.

Reversed.

Justice Martin

dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

At the heart of the majority's reasoning is its unsubstantiated concern
that to find that the evidence presented by defendant would support an
instruction on self-defense would "expand our law of self-defense beyond
the limits of immediacy and necessity." Defendant does not seek to
expand or relax the requirements of self-defense and thereby "legalize
the opportune killing of allegedly abusive husbands by their wives," as
the majority overstates. Rather, defendant contends that the evidence as
gauged by the existing laws of self-defense is sufficient to require the
submission of a self-defense instruction to the jury. The proper issue
for this Court is to determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light
most favorable to the defendant, was sufficient to require the trial
court to instruct on the law of self-defense. I conclude that it was.

**\[ ... \]**

Evidence presented by defendant described a twenty-year history of
beatings and other dehumanizing and degrading treatment by her husband.
In his expert testimony a clinical psychologist concluded that defendant
fit "and exceeded\]" the profile of an abused or battered spouse,
analogizing this treatment to the dehumanization process suffered by
prisoners of war under the Nazis during the Second World War and the
brainwashing techniques of the Korean War. The psychologist described
the defendant as a woman incarcerated by abuse, by fear, and by her
conviction that her husband was invincible and inescapable:

> Mrs. Norman didn't leave because she believed, fully believed that
> escape was totally impossible. There was no place to go. He, she had
> left before; he had come and gotten her. She had gone to the
> Department of Social Services. He had come and gotten her. The law,
> she believed the law could not protect her; no one could protect her,
> and I must admit, looking over the records, that there was nothing
> done that would contradict that belief. She fully believed that he was
> invulnerable to the law and to all social agencies that were
> available; that nobody could withstand his power. As a result, there
> was no such thing as escape.

**\[ ... \]**

Defendant's isolation and helplessness were evident in testimony that
her family was intimidated by her husband into acquiescing**\[ ...
\]**in his torture of her. Witnesses also described defendant's
experience with social service agencies and the law, which had
contributed to her sense of futility and abandonment through the
inefficacy of their protection and the strength of her husband's wrath
when they failed. Where torture appears interminable and escape
impossible, the belief that only the death of the oppressor can provide
relief is reasonable in the mind of a person of ordinary firmness, let
alone in the mind of the defendant, who, like a prisoner of war of some
years, has been deprived of her humanity and is held hostage by fear.

In *State v. Mize,* 316 N.C. 48, 53, 340 S.E. 2d 439, 442 (1986), this
Court noted that if the defendant was in "no imminent danger" at the
time of the killing, then his belief that it was necessary to kill the
man who had pursued him eight hours before was unreasonable. The second
element of self-defense was therefore not satisfied. In the context of
the doctrine of self-defense, the definition of "imminent" must be
informed by the defendant's perceptions. It is not bounded merely by
measurable time-, but by all of the facts and circumstances. Its meaning
depends upon the assessment of the facts by one of "ordinary firmness"
with regard to whether the defendant's perception of impending death or
injury was so pressing as to render reasonable her belief that it was
necessary to kill.

**\[ ... \]**For the battered wife, if there is no escape, if there is
no window of relief or momentary sense of safety, then the next attack,
which could be the fatal one, is imminent. In the context of the
doctrine of self-defense, "imminent" is a term the meaning of which must
be grasped from the defendant's point of view. Properly stated, the
second prong of the question is not whether the threat was *in fact*
imminent, but whether defendant's belief in the impending nature of the
threat, given the circumstances as she saw them, was reasonable in the
mind of a person of ordinary firmness.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X562f9a5e33431b69dcc8c45ec5bb0c8e7de2f58)

Defendant's intense fear, based on her belief that her husband intended
not only to maim or deface her, as he had in the past, but to kill her,
was evident in the testimony of witnesses who recounted events of the
last three days of the decedent's life. This testimony could have led a
juror to conclude that defendant reasonably perceived a threat to her
life as "imminent," even while her husband slept. Over these three days,
her husband's anger was exhibited in an unprecedented crescendo of
violence. The evidence showed defendant's fear and sense of hopelessness
similarly intensifying, leading to an unsuccessful attempt to escape
through suicide and culminating in her belief that escape would be
possible only through her husband's death.

**\[ ... \]**

In *State v. Wingler,* 184 N.C. 747, 115 S.E. 59 (1922), in which the
defendant was found guilty for the murder of his wife, Justice (later
Chief Justice) Stacy recognized the pain and oppression under which a
woman suffers at the hands of an abusive husband: "The supreme tragedy
of life is the immolation of woman. With a heavy hand, nature exacts
from her a high tax of blood and tears." *Id.* at 751, 115 S.E. at 61.
By his barbaric conduct over the course of twenty years, J. T. Norman
reduced the quality of the defendant's life to such an abysmal state
that, given the opportunity to do so, the jury might well have found
that she was justified in acting in self-defense for the preservation of
her tragic life.

It is to be remembered that defendant does not have the burden of
persuasion as to self-defense; the burden remains with the state to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally killed
decedent without excuse or justification. **\[ ... \]**If the evidence
in support of self-defense is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in
the mind of a rational juror whether the state has proved an intentional
killing without justification or excuse, self-defense must be submitted
to the jury. This is such a case.

State v. Abbott

 

Supreme Court of New Jersey

36 N.J. 63

1961-11-06

Argued September 13, 1961

Weintraub, C. J.

Frank Abbott was convicted of atrocious assault and battery. **\[ ...
\]**

Abbott shared a common driveway with his neighbors, Michael and Mary
Scarano. The Scaranos engaged a contractor to pave their portion. Abbott
obtained some asphalt from the contractor and made a doorstop to keep
his garage door from swinging onto the Scaranos' property. Nicholas
Scarano, who was visiting with the Scaranos, his parents, objected to
Abbott's innovation. After some words between them a fist fight ensued.

Although Abbott managed to land the first punch, with which he sent
Nicholas to the ground, a jury could find Nicholas was the aggressor. At
this point Michael Scarano came at Abbott with a hatchet. Michael said
the tool had just been returned to him by the contractor, and denied he
meant to use it as a weapon. According to Abbott, Mary Scarano followed,
armed with a carving knife and large fork. The actors gave varying
versions of what happened, but the end result was that all of the
Scaranos were hit by the hatchet. Nicholas received severe head
injuries. Abbott claimed he too suffered a laceration.

Abbott admitted he finally wrested the hatchet from Michael but denied
he wielded it at all. Rather he insisted that the Scaranos were injured
during a common struggle for the instrument. A jury could, however, find
Abbott intentionally inflicted the blows.

Abbott was separately indicted for atrocious assault and battery upon
each of the Scaranos. There was a common trial of these indictments. The
jury acquitted Abbott of the charges relating to Michael and Mary, but
found him guilty as to Nicholas.

I.

The principal question is whether the trial court properly instructed
the jury upon the issue of self-defense. The trial court **\[ ...
\]**charged also upon the subject of retreat, and it is here that error
is alleged. Although the jury could have found Abbott used excessive
force, we cannot know whether the jury found for him on that subject and
convicted because he had failed to retreat in accordance with the trial
court's instruction.

As to retreat, the trial court charged upon two hypotheses. One was that
the critical events occurred upon Abbott's property. Upon that basis,
the court said Abbott could stand his ground, and, of course, of this
Abbott does not complain. The second hypothesis was that the alleged
offense occurred upon the common driveway. Presumably on the authority
of *State v.* Pontery, 19 *N. J.* 457, 475 (1955), the trial court held
that since all the principals were equally entitled to be on the
driveway, Abbott could not claim *immunity* from the ordinary retreat
rule. **\[ ... \]**

The question whether one who is neither the aggressor nor a party to a
mutual combat must retreat has divided the authorities. Self-defense is
measured against necessity. **\[ ... \]**From that premise one could
readily say there was no necessity to kill in self-defense if the use of
deadly force could have been avoided by retreat. The critics of the
retreat rule do not quarrel with the theoretical validity of this
conclusion, but rather condemn it as unrealistic. The law of course
should not denounce conduct as criminal when it accords with the
behavior of reasonable men. Upon this level, the advocates of no-retreat
say the manly thing is to hold one's ground, and hence society should
not demand what smacks of cowardice. Adherents of the retreat rule reply
it is better that the assailed shall retreat than that the life of
another be needlessly spent. They add that not only do right-thinking
men agree, but further a rule so requiring may well induce others to
adhere to that worthy standard of behavior. **\[ ... \]**

Other jurisdictions are closely divided upon the retreat doctrine. **\[
... \]**The *Model Penal Code* embraces the retreat rule while
acknowledging that on numerical balance a majority of the precedents
oppose it. *Model Penal Code* § 3.04, comment 3, at *p.* 24 *(Tent.
Draft No.* 8, 1958).

We are not persuaded to depart from the principle of retreat. We think
it salutary if reasonably limited. Much of the criticism goes not to its
inherent validity but rather to unwarranted applications of the rule.
Eor example, it is correctly observed that one can hardly retreat from a
rifle shot at close range. But if the weapon were a knife, a lead of a
city block might well be enough. Again, the rule cannot be stated
baldly, with indifference to the excitement of the occasion. As Mr.
Justice Holmes cryptically put it, "Detached reflection cannot be
demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife." *Brown v. United
States,* 256 *U. S.* 335, 343, 41 *S. Ct.* 501, 65 *L. Ed.* 961, 963
(1921). Such considerations, however, do not demand that a man should
have the absolute right to stand his ground and kill in any and all
situations. Bather they call for a fair and guarded statement of
appropriate principles.

**\[ ... \]**

We believe the following principles are sound:

1\. The issue of retreat arises only if the defendant resorted to a
deadly force. It is deadly force which is not justifiable when an
opportunity to retreat is at hand. *Model Penal Code* § 3.04(2) (b)
(iii). As defined in § 3.12(2) a deadly force means "force which the
actor uses with the purpose of causing or which he knows to create a
substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm."

Hence it is not the nature of the force defended against which raises
the issue of retreat, but rather the nature of the force which the
accused employed in his defense. If he does not resort to a deadly
force, one who is assailed may hold his ground whether the attack upon
him be of a deadly or some lesser character. Although it might be argued
that a safe retreat should be taken if thereby the use of *any* force
could be avoided, yet, as the comment in the *Model Penal Code* observes
(at *p.* 23), "The logic of this position never has been accepted when
moderate force is used in self-defense; here all agree that the actor
may stand his ground and estimate necessity upon that basis." *Cf.
Prosser, Torts* §19, at *p.* 90 *(2d ed.* 1955); *Restatement, Torts*
**\[ ... \]** 63 (1934). Hence, in a case like the present one, the jury
should be instructed that Abbott could hold his ground when Nicholas
came at him with his fists, and also when Michael and Mary came at him
with the several instruments mentioned, and that the question of retreat
could arise only if Abbott intended to use a deadly force.

*2.* What constitutes an opportunity to retreat which will defeat the
right of self-defense? As § 3.04(2) (b) (iii) of the *Model Penal Code*
states, deadly force is not justifiable "if the actor *knows* that he
can avoid the necessity of using such force *with complete safety* by
retreating*.*We emphasize "knows" and "with complete safety." One who is
wrongfully attacked need not risk injury by retreating, even though he
could escape with something less than serious bodily injury. It would be
unreal to require nice calculations as to the amount of hurt, or to ask
him to endure any at all. And the issue is not whether in retrospect it
can be found the defendant could have retreated unharmed. Rather the
question is whether he knew the opportunity was there, and of course in
that inquiry the total circumstances including the attendant excitement
must be considered.**\[ ... \]**We add that upon a retrial the facts as
developed in the light of this principle may be such that Abbott would
be entitled to an instruction that if his version of the approach by
Michael and Mary is accepted, the issue of retreat must be resolved in
Abbott's favor.\"

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

As we have said, the subject of retreat arises most often in homicide
cases. It is equally pertinent if the charge is assault with intent to
kill **\[ ... \]**. Here the charge is atrocious assault and battery (N.
*J. S.* 2A:90-1), a crime which involves vicious or brutal conduct. **\[
... \]**The doctrine of retreat reflects a policy with respect to the
use of deadly force, and the same policy considerations equally obtain
if the end result is something less than murder. **\[ ... \]**This seems
sound, and hence an instruction upon the subject is appropriate in a
trial for atrocious assault and battery, but the instruction should be
expressly centered about the use of deadly force.

not inconsistent herewith.

Opinion

BURKE, J.

Don Ceballos was found guilty by a jury of assault with a deadly weapon
(Pen. Code, § 245). Imposition of sentence was suspended and he was
placed on probation.**\[ ... \]**

Defendant lived alone in a home in San Anselmo. The regular living
quarters were above the garage, but defendant sometimes slept in the
garage and had about \$2,500 worth of property there.

In March 1970 some tools were stolen from defendant's home. On May 12,
1970, he noticed the lock on his garage doors was bent and pry marks
were on one of the doors. The next day he mounted a loaded .22 caliber
pistol in the garage. The pistol was aimed at the center of the garage
doors and was connected by a wire to one of the doors so that the pistol
would discharge if the door was opened several inches.

The damage to defendant's lock had been done by a 16-year-old boy named
Stephen and a 15-year-old boy named Robert. On the afternoon of May 15,
1970, the boys returned to defendant's house while he was away. Neither
boy was armed with a gun or knife. After looking in the windows and
seeing no one, Stephen succeeded in removing the lock on the garage
doors with a crowbar, and, as he pulled the door outward, he was hit in
the face with a bullet from the pistol.

Stephen testified: He intended to go into the garage "\[f\]or musical
equipment" because he had a debt to pay to a friend. His "way of paying
that debt would be to take \[defendant's\] property and sell it" and use
the proceeds to pay the debt. He "wasn't going to do it \[i.e., steal\]
for sure, necessarily." He was there "to look around," and "getting in,
I don't know if I would have actually stolen."

Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted having set up the trap
gun. He stated that after noticing the pry marks on his garage door on
May 12, he felt he should "set up some kind of a trap, something to keep
the burglar out of my home." When asked why he was trying to keep the
burglar out, he replied, ". . . Because somebody was trying to steal my
property . . . and I don't want to come home some night and have the
thief in there . . . usually a thief is pretty desperate . . . and . . .
they just pick up a weapon \... if they don't have one . . . and do the
best they can."

*\[D\]*efendant stated[^105] that "he didn't have much and he wanted to
protect what he did have."

*\[T\]*he jury found defendant guilty of assault with a deadly weapon.
(Pen. Code, § 245.) An assault is "an unlawful attempt, coupled with a
present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another."
(Pen. Code, § 240.)

Defendant contends that had he been present he would have been justified
in shooting Stephen since . Stephen was attempting to commit burglary
(Pen. Code, § 459), that under cases such as *United States* v.
*Gilliam,* 25 F.Cas. 1319 \[1 Hayw. *&* H. 109\], defendant had a right
to do indirectly what he could have done directly, and that therefore
any attempt by him to commit a violent injury upon Stephen was not
"unlawful" and hence not an assault. The People argue that the rule in
*Gilliam* is unsound, that as a matter of law a trap gun constitutes
excessive force, and that in any event the circumstances Were not in
fact such as to warrant the use of deadly force.

**\[ ... \]**

In the United States, courts have concluded that a person may be held
criminally liable **\[ ... \]**or civilly liable, if he sets upon his
premises a deadly mechanical device and that device kills or injures
another. **\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**However, an exception to the rule that
there may be criminal and civil liability for death or injuries caused
by such a device has been recognized where the intrusion is, in fact,
such that the person, were he present, would be justified in taking the
life or inflicting the bodily harm with his own hands. **\[ ... \]**

Allowing persons, at their own risk, to employ deadly mechanical devices
imperils the lives of children, firemen and policemen acting within the
scope of their employment, and others. Where the actor is present, there
is always the possibility he will realize that deadly force is not
necessary, but deadly mechanical devices are without mercy or
discretion. Such devices "are silent instrumentalities of death. They
deal death and destruction to the innocent as well as the criminal
intruder without the slightest warning. The taking of human life \[or
infliction of great bodily injury\] by such means is brutally savage and
inhuman." (See *State* v. *Plumlee, supra,* 149 So. 425, 430.)

*\[T\]*he use of such devices should not be encouraged. Moreover,
whatever may be thought in torts, the foregoing rule setting forth an
exception to liability for death or injuries inflicted by such devices
"is inappropriate in penal law for it is obvious that it does not
prescribe a workable standard of conduct; liability depends upon
fortuitous results." (See Model Penal Code (Tent. Draft No. 8), § 3.06,
com. 15.) We therefore decline to adopt that rule in Criminal cases.

Furthermore, even if that rule were applied here, as we shall see,
defendant was not justified in shooting Stephen. Penal Code section .
197 provides: "Homicide is . . . justifiable \... 1. When resisting any
attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some great
bodily- injury upon any person; or, 2. When committed in defense of
habitation, property, or person, against one who manifestly intends or
endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony . . . ." (See
also Pen. Code, § 198.) (2) Since a homicide is justifiable under the
circumstances specified in section 197, a fortiori an attempt to commit
a violent injury upon another under those circumstances is justifiable.

By its terms subdivision 1 of Penal Code section 197 appears to permit
killing to. .prevent any "felony," but in view of the large number of
felonies today and the inclusion of many that do not involve a danger of
serious bodily harm, a literal reading of the section is undesirable.
(See 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) p. 159; *Justification for the Use of
Force in Criminal Law,* 13 Stan.L.Rev. 566, 578-579.) *People* v.
*Jones,* 191 Cal. App.2d 478, 481 \[12 Cal.Rptr. 777\], **\[ ... \]**
read into section 197, subdivision 1, the limitation that the felony be
" 'some atrocious crime attempted to be committed by force.' "
*\[When\]* the character of the crime, and the manner of its
perpetration **\[ ... \]***do not reasonably create a fear of great
bodily harm,* **\[ ... \]***there is no cause for the exaction of a
human life."* (Italics added; see also Harper and James, The Law of
Torts (1956) pp. 1441-1442, fn. 38; but see 1 Bjshop's Criminal Law (9th
ed.) p. 608.)

*Jones* involved subdivision 1 of Penal Code section 197, but
subdivision 2 of that section is likewise so limited. The term "violence
or surprise" in subdivision 2 is found in common law authorities **\[
... \]**, and, whatever may have been the very early common law **\[ ...
\]**, the rule developed at common law that killing or.use of deadly
force to prevent a felony was justified only if the offense was a
forcible and atrocious crime. **\[ ... \]** "Surprise" means an
unexpected attack --- which includes force and violence **\[ ... \]**,
and the word thus appears redundant.

Examples of forcible and atrocious crimes are murder, mayhem, rape and
robbery. **\[ ... \]** In such crimes "from their atrocity and violence
human life \[or personal safety from great harm\] either is, or is
presumed to be, in peril" (see *United States* v. *Gilliam, supra,* 25
F.Cas. 1319, 1320**\[ ... \]**).

Burglary has been included in the list of such crimes. **\[ ... \]**
However, in view of the wide scope of burglary under Penal Code section
459, as compared with the common law definition of that offense, in. our
opinion it cannot be said that under all circumstances burglary under
section 459 constitutes a forcible and atrocious crime.[^106]

• Where the character and manner of the burglary do not reasonably
create a fear of great bodily harm, there is no cause for exaction of
human life **\[ ... \]**, or for the use of deadly force **\[ ... \]**.

In the instant case the asserted burglary did not threaten death or
serious bodily harm, since no one but Stephen and Robert was then on the
premises. A defendant is not protected from liability merely by the fact
that the intruder's conduct is such as would justify the defendant, were
he present, in believing that the intrusion threatened death or serious
bodily injury. **\[ ... \]**

We thus conclude that defendant was not justified under Penal Code
section 197, subdivisions 1 or 2, in shooting Stephen to prevent him
from committing burglary. **\[ ... \]**

*\[I\]*n view of the supreme value of human life (see *People* v.
*Jones, supra,* 191 Cal.App.2d 478, 482), we do not believe bodily force
can be justified to prevent all felonies of the foregoing type[^107],
including ones in which no person is, or is reasonably believed to be,
on the premises except the would-be burglar.

**\[ ... \]**

We conclude that as a matter of law the exception to the rule of
liability fpr injuries inflicted by a deadly mechanical device does not
apply under the circumstances here appearing.

Excerpt:

> This article suggests that the mother should be able to assert that
> she is justified in not protecting the child because of the risk of
> death or serious bodily injury to herself.
>
> Criminal liability for these mothers is increasingly based on a
> \"failure to protect\" or omissions theory. Ordinarily, a person
> accused of a crime is required to commit a voluntary act (actus reus)
> with a required state of mind (mens rea) before society will attach
> criminal significance or liability to the person\'s behavior. There
> are crimes, however, which are either specifically defined in terms of
> failure to perform some specified act or failure to act when there is
> a legal duty to do so.
>
> \*\*\*
>
> The unspoken assumption may be that the mother can end the abuse by
> simply picking up the phone and calling the police. Such assumptions
> ignore the realities of violence by the significant other. By making
> such assumptions, the courts are in fact requiring that mothers risk
> serious bodily injury or death before their duty to act is satisfied.

[^3]: **^10^** As Judge Medina pointed out in *Plattner, supra,* 330
    F.2d at 274, the Sixth Amendment was proposed by Congress one day
    after Section 35 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the substantially
    verbatim forerunner of 28 U.S.C. § 1654, was signed by President
    Washington.

    The bill was drafted and enacted at a time when there was a "current
    state of incertitude regarding the probability of constitutional
    amendment." J. Goebel, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, p. 490,

[^4]: **^15^** The Court's and Justice Ginsburg's reliance
    upon*Liparota* v. *United States,* 471 U. S. 419 (1985), is
    misplaced. *Ante,* at 610-612; *ante,* at 621-622. Although the
    Court is usually concerned with fine nuances of statutory text, its
    discussion of *Liparota* simply ignores the fact that the food stamp
    fraud provision, unlike § 5861(d), contained the word "knowingly."
    The Members of the Court in *Liparota* disagreed on the proper
    interpretation. The dissenters accepted the Government's view that
    the term merely required proof that the defendant had knowledge of
    the facts that constituted the crime. See *Liparota,* 471 U. S., at
    442-443 (White, J., dissenting) ("I would read § 2024(b)(1)\... to
    require awareness of only the relevant aspects of one's conduct
    rendering it illegal, not the fact of illegality"). The majority,
    however, concluded that "knowingly" also connoted knowledge of
    illegality. *Id.,* at 424-425. Because neither "knowingly" nor any
    comparable term appears in § 5861(d), the statute before us today
    requires even less proof of knowledge than the dissenters would have
    demanded in *Liparota.*

[^6]: **^7^** Brief for Petitioner 16. There were 5,251 arrests under
    the ordinance in 1993, 15,660 in 1994, and 22,056 in 1995. City of
    Chicago, R. Daley & T. Hillard, Gang and Narcotic Related Violent
    Crime: 1993-1997, p. 7 (June 1998).

    The city believes that the ordinance resulted in a significant
    decline in gang-related homicides. It notes that in 1995, the last
    year the ordinance was enforced, the gang-related homicide rate fell
    by 26%. In 1996, after the ordinance had been held invalid, the
    gang-related homicide rate rose 11%. Pet. for Cert. 9, n. 5.
    However, gang-related homicides fell by 19% in 1997, over a year
    after the suspension of the ordinance. Daley & Hil-lard, at 5. Given
    the myriad factors that influence levels of violence, it is
    difficult to evaluate the probative value of this statistical
    evidence, or to reach any firm conclusion about the ordinance's
    efficacy. Cf. Harcourt, Reflecting on the Subject: A Critique of the
    Social Influence Conception of Deterrence, the Broken Windows
    Theory, and Order-Maintenance Policing New York Style, 97 Mich. L.

    among\... experts over the causes of the decline in crime in New
    York City and nationally").

[^11]: **^9^** The plurality suggests,*ante,* at 59, that dispersal
    orders are, by their nature, vague. The plurality purports to
    distinguish its sweeping condemnation of dispersal orders from
    *Colten* v. *Kentucky,* 407 U. S. 104 (1972), but I see no
    principled ground for doing so. The logical implication of the
    plurality's assertion is that the police can never issue dispersal
    orders. For example, in the plurality's view, it is apparently
    unconstitutional for a police officer to ask a group of gawkers to
    move along in order to secure a crime scene.

    "(a) Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably
    believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public
    place with one or more other persons, he shall order all such
    persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person
    who does not promptly obey such an order is in violation of this
    section.

    "(b) It shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of
    this section that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a
    member of a criminal street gang.

    "(c) As used in this Section:

    "(1) 'Loiter' means to remain in any one place with no apparent
    purpose.

    "(2) 'Criminal street gang' means any ongoing organization,
    association in fact or group of three or more persons, whether
    formal or informal, having as one of its substantial activities the
    commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in
    paragraph (3), and whose members individually or collectively engage
    in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.

    "(5) 'Public place' means the public way and any other location open
    to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.

    "(e) Any person who violates this Section is subject to a fine of
    not less than \$100 and not more than \$500 for each offense, or
    imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

    "In addition to or instead of the above penalties, any person who
    violates this section may be required to perform up to 120 hours of

    Scales test (WAIS-III), the standard instrument in the United States
    for assessing intellectual functioning. AAMR, Mental Retardation,
    *supra.* The WAIS-III is scored by adding together the number of
    points earned on different subtests, and using a mathematical
    formula to convert this raw score into a scaled score. The test
    measures an intelligence range from 45 to 155. The mean score of the
    test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is
    considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning. A.
    Kaufman & E. Liehtenberger, Essentials of WAIS-III Assessment 60
    (1999). It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the
    population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically
    considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong
    of the mental retardation definition. 2 Kaplan & Sadock's
    Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock
    eds. 7th ed. 2000).

    At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: "\[Atkins'\] full
    scale IQ is 59. Compared to the population at large, that means less
    than one percentile. . . . Mental retardation is a relatively rare
    thing. It's about one percent of the population." App. 274.
    According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins' IQ score "would automatically
    qualify for Social Security disability income."*Id.,* at 280. Dr.
    Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he
    had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the
    criteria for mental retardation. *Id.,* at 310. He testified that,
    in his opinion, Atkins' limited intellect had been a consistent
    feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an
    "aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score." *Id.,* at

    The nullification doctrine derives from the same moral principles as
    the*mens rea* or responsibility defense. But in view of my
    conclusion that the trial judge should have granted a nullification

    The Supreme Court has indicated though not held that an accused may
    be competent to stand trial and yet be incompetent to waive his
    right to counsel. Westbrook v. Arizona,384 U.S. 150, 86 S.Ct. 1320,
    16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966). The Ninth Circuit apparently does not even
    recognize that limitation of the *pro se* right, see United States
    v. Odom, 423 F.2d 875 (9th Cir. 1970). Such a limitation, if it
    exists, suggests that there is a point of in-eompetency, short of
    complete incapacity, where a defendant is able to understand the
    nature of the charges against him and to assist in the preparation
    of his defense, yet does not have the capacity to waive counsel and
    undertake representation of himself.

    Obviously, appellants intelligently waived their right to counsel.

[^41]: **^16^** The framers of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and the Sixth
    Amendment were undoubtedly aware that *pro se* defendants are likely
    to say and do things that would constitute manifest irregularities
    if done by members of the bar. A dramatic instance came in United
    States v. Lyon, Fed.Cas.No.8,646, a 1799 trial, for violation of the
    Sedition Act, against a truculent Congressman charged with
    publishing a libel that considerations of public welfare had been
    swallowed up in the Executive's continuous grasp for power,
    unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation and selfish
    avarice. Justice Paterson presided at the trial. Lyon, conducting
    his own defense, actually asked the judge whether he had not
    frequently dined with the President and observed his ridiculous pomp
    and parade. Justice Paterson replied that he had dined rarely with
    the President, and had never seen pomp or parade but rather much
    plainness. See Goebel, op. cit. *supra,* note 10, p. 638.

    At an 1800 trial Thomas Cooper,*pro se,* was not permitted to
    subpoena the President, but he "was given great latitude in what he
    was permitted to offer in his defense." Thus Justice Chase issued
    subpoenas at the defendant's request to members of Congress. Goebel,
    *supra,* p. 640.

    The*Lee* decision states that a defendant is not entitled to
    "hybrid" representation in open court --- both *pro se* and by
    counsel. *See* generally Annotation, 77 A.L.R.2d 1233 (1961). *But

[^43]: **^18^** There is a distinction in function between an amicus
    appointed to assist defendant and one appointed to assist the court.
    The latter may call witnesses and ask questions, without reference
    to the defendant, under the same authority that permits the judge
    himself to take such action in the interest of justice. *Compare*
    United States v. Brown, *supra,* 105 U.S. App.D.C. at 83, 264 F.2d
    at 369 (concurring opinion of Judge Burger). The ABA Standards

    functions.

[^45]: **^20^** *Allen* involved a waiver, of one's right to be present
    at the trial, by disruptive behavior. The Court emphasized however
    that the right to be present could be reclaimed by a simple promise
    not to engage in further disruption, 397 U.S. at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057.
    We think a similar rule may be inappropriate regarding reclamation
    of the *pro se* right. Unlike a change in the physical location of
    defendant, a change from *pro se* representation and back again is
    likely to promote incoherence and destroy the jury's understanding.
    Reclamation of the *pro se* right after disruptive behavior is
    properly a matter left to the trial court's sound discretion.

[^46]: **^21^** At one point, Mr. Hirschkop on behalf of defendants made

[^53]: **^28^** The defendant's free will to handle his own case may not
    be as absolute as his right, say, to withhold consent for surgery
    needed to save his life. The judge's authority to insist on
    intelligent assertion will presumably suffice to take care, e. *g.,*
    of cases where *pro se* representation would jettison defenses in a
    trial that would be tantamount to a travesty on justice. There is
    also the judge's authority to ask questions and call witnesses, to
    appoint amicus curiae, to set aside a conviction and grant a new
    trial.

[^54]: **^29^** We are not referring here to the tactical advantage that
    leads a defendant to claim *pro se* representation, that he
    can-present his demeanor, and sometimes "testify," without being
    subject to impeachment or cross-examination. Ironically, this
    tactical advantage would be most appreciated by a lawyer on trial,
    and yet he would be likely to have his *pro se* choice accepted
    without question.

[^55]: **^30^** The matter of *pro se* defenses in this case presented a
    difficult issue of law which it became the duty of Judge Pratt to
    decide at the outset. We do not agree with his decision denying pro
    se representation. But the transcript clearly demonstrates that the
    judge acted from the first, and continued without impatience to act,
    in a painstaking effort to take into account the position and needs
    of defendants, in a difficult and free-form situation --- which was
    in more than one sense a trial. He was sensitive and responsive,
    even over prosecution objection, *e. g,,* Tr. 673, to the
    desirability of informality and flexibility in structuring
    presentation of defendants and their case to the jury--- whether by
    permitting defendants to make opening statements, Tr. 301 et seq.,
    to participate in bench conferences, e. *g,,* Tr. 402, or to inspect
    prosecution evidence before admission, *e. g.,* Tr. 532. His efforts
    at moderating the potentially harsh effects of his denial of *pro
    se* defenses were in the highest traditions of our courts. Save for
    the crucial error in his initial ruling, these determinations by
    Judge Pratt showed the kind of approach that will hopefully dilute
    the troublesome aspects of *pro se* representation.

[^57]: **^32^** See R. Pound, Law in Books and Law in Action, 44
    Am.L.Rev. 12, 18 (1910) : "Jury lawlessness is the greatest
    corrective of law in its actual administration. The will of the
    state at large imposed on a reluctant community, the will of a
    majority imposed on a vigorous and determined minority, find the
    same obstacle in the local jury that formerly confronted kings and
    ministers." Pound comments that the law as written, and invoked by
    prosecutors, "demands conviction of persons whom local or even
    general opinion does not desire to punish," and adds that "the law
    is often too mechanical at a point requiring nicety of adjustment."

[^58]: **^33^** (Pub. Little, Brown 1966). The study of the American
    jury system, undertaken at the University of Chicago Law School, is
    a composite analysis of 3576 criminal jury trials, with particular
    focus on the 1063 instances where the judge reported that he
    disagreed with the jury verdict, and why. Half these cases present
    an apparent difference between judge and jury on "sentiments on the
    law."

    The study supports in depth the conclusion that the jury is likely
    to call on its prerogative of lenity and equity, contrary to the
    judge's instruction, when the case is one where it can empathize
    with the defendant, feeling either that the jurors might well have
    been or come to be in the same position, or that in the large the
    defendant's conduct is not so contrary to general conduct standards
    as to be condemned as criminally deviate conduct. From a study
    teeming with illustrations, the following are cited as examples.

    The authors broadly discern that "in cases having a de minimis cast
    or a note of contributory fault or provocation \* \* \* the jury
    will exercise its de facto powers to write these equities into the
    criminal law" (p. 285) and "an impatience with the nicety of the
    law's boundaries hedging the privilege of self-defense" (p. 241).
    (E. g., acquittal for retaliation following assaults, or even
    harassment and provocation, without present danger; for violence
    erupting after domestic strife, or unfaithfulness of spouse; for
    fraud of a victim still the seller's friend; for statutory rape of a
    girl unchaste; for sale of liquor to a minor who is a member of the
    armed forces).

    Perhaps most relevant is eh. 19 on Unpopular Laws, p. 286 et seq.
    Though the authors discerned no law prompting a jury revolt
    comparable to the historic acquittals on charges of violation of
    seditious libel or fugitive slave laws, or even Prohibition, the
    data indicate that the historic role of the jury as a bulwark
    against official tyranny is "dimly evident in its contemporary role
    as a moderate corrective against undue prosecutions for gambling,
    game and liquor violations and, to some extent, drunken driving" (p.
    296), the jury's traditional hostility to sump-tuary legislation
    being "keyed to its perception that . . . widespread violation is
    tolerated" so that prosecution of a particular defendant is contrary
    to the principle of evenhanded justice (p. 287). And so in some
    counties "people generally do not like the game law" (p. 288). In
    counties where jurors play the numbers they acquit broadly in
    gambling cases (p. 289) etc. When the jurors "feel the same thing
    could happen to them," they will acquit even of negligent
    manslaughter charges, as in running a red light, though there are
    more convictions in cases involving extreme speed. (Oh. 24).

    \[F\]ear of arbitrary judicial action . \' . . was especially strong
    in the United States because in seventeenth-century England (the
    time of colonizing America) the criminal law, in the hands of
    appointees of the crown subject to arbitrary removal, had been found
    an effective agent of political and religious persecution. . . .
    Colonial justice was long executive or legislative. There had been
    but little experience of true judicial justice with the checks upon
    judicial action which the common law tradition and pressure of
    professional opinion provided.

    the law's "great landmarks" for all who view "liberty and law as

    holding the provision of the Maryland Constitution consistent with
    the Federal Constitution, Judge Sobeloff noted that "a practice may
    be deemed unwise, yet not be unconstitutional." He referred to the
    "potent and persuasive arguments leveled against the wisdom of the
    Maryland practice," and the various jurists' analyses condemning it
    as "archaic, outmoded and atrocious," "unique and indefensible," an
    "antique constitutional thorn" in "the flesh of Maryland's body of
    Criminal Law."

    In Maryland the juries must be told the judge's instructions on the
    law are only "advisory". In Indiana, a similar constitutional
    provision was attenuated by a decision that a trial court in a
    criminal case "is not required to neutralize the effect of its
    instructions by telling the jury that they are at liberty to
    disregard them, and to decide the law for themselves." Bridgewater

    a call of higher conscience they believe strong and clear. Indeed in
    1830 the bankers of England formally petitioned the Commons to
    abolish capital punishment for forgery because this prevented
    convictions "and thus endangers the property which it is intended to
    protect." Radzinowicz, op. cit.*supra,* Appendix 3, p. 730. (The
    Petition of Bankers from 214 Cities and Towns, May 24, 1830)

    Blackstone refers to the "pious perjury" under which jurors
    understated the value of articles stolen in order to avoid the
    capital charge. 4 Comm. 239. Professor Radzinowicz (op. cit. supra,
    at ch. 3, and 4) develops this and other lenity practices of grand
    and petit juries in the 18th and 19th centuries, and even includes
    (p. 94, fn. 49) an instance wherein Lord Mansfield --- -a strict
    judge --- advised a jury to find a gold trinket of less value than
    40 shillings. When the prosecutor indignantly exclaimed that its
    fashion alone was worth double that, Lord Mansfield observed, "God
    forbid, gentlemen, we should hang a man for fashion's sake."

[^79]: **^54^** Finally, ladies and gentlemen, you are not trying the
    Vietnam War. The Vietnam War is not an issue in this ease. You are
    not trying ideas. You are not trying the United States. You are not
    trying society. You are not trying any individual, any corporation,
    large or small. For there can be no freedom, no equal opportunity in
    an environment of criminal behavior. No nation should tolerate
    disregard of the law.

    As Mr. Justice Goldberg said in the recent Supreme Court case of Cox
    against Louisiana \[379 U.S. 559,85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487\] :

    > The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of
    > an organized society maintaining public order without which
    > liberty itself would be lost.

    And he went on further to say in that ease:

    > We also reaffirm the repeated decisions of this Court that there
    > is no place for violence in a democratic society dedicated to
    > liberty under law, and that the right of peaceful protest does not
    > mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may do so
    > at any time and at any place. There is a proper time and place for
    > even the most peaceful protest and a plain duty and responsibility
    > on the part of all citizens to obey all valid laws and
    > regulations.

    If you find that the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt
    that one or more of the defendants committed each of the elements
    comprising the crimes of second degree burglary and/or malicious
    destruction of property, then I must instruct you further that the
    law does not recognize as a defense to either of these charges that
    the defendants were motivated to commit their acts by sincere
    political, religious or moral convictions or in obedience to some
    higher law.

    Individuals who believe that the Vietnam War is illegal or immoral
    or that certain activities of the Dow Company are undesirable have
    the right under our system of government to express their views or
    to protest these events by any lawful means, such as by peaceful
    picketing or parading. But the Constitution of the United States
    does not protect as a form of symbolic speech the destruction of
    private property and the violation of valid laws designed to protect
    society.

    The defendants may have been motivated by the highest moral
    principles, and they may have been sincerely and passionately
    inspired. But such motives do not confer immunity from prosecution
    or conviction for the violation of a valid law, and as such the
    motives of the defendants are not controlling in the case which is
    before you for decision.

    Therefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of
    the defendants had the required intent to commit one or more of the
    offenses with which they are charged, then it is no defense that he
    or she also had one or more other intentions, reasons, purposes or
    motives, such as to protest against the Vietnam War or the
    activities of the Dow Company; nor is it a defense that he or she
    acted from sincere, religious motives, or that he or she believed
    that his or her intent was justified by some higher law. (Tr.
    825-827.)

[^81]: **^1^** Defendants argue that the right to proceed pro se is both
    Constitutional and absolute. But not all Constitutional rights are
    absolute. Indeed, the right to be represented by counsel may be
    intelligently and knowingly waived, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458,
    58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1937), and the right to discharge one
    attorney for another after the trial has begun is subject to the
    trial court's discretion, *see* Evans v. Ockershausen, 69
    U.S.App.D.C. 285, 100 F.2d 695 (1938). Other rights, such as the
    very important right to be present during the trial itself, may be
    waived by obstreperous conduct. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 90
    S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). The considerations deemed
    important in *Alim* apply to a case such as this.

    In another case, it may be important to distinguish the source of
    the right to proceed pro se. If that right is Constitutional in
    origin, as held in United States v. Plattner,330 F.2d 271 (2d Cir.
    1964), then any violation of that right at all might require a
    remand for new trial, despite the absence of prejudice. *See id.,*
    at 273, and the cases cited in footnote 2 therein. On the other
    hand, if the right is statutory only, then it may be subject to the
    harmless error doctrine. Similarly, if the right here asserted is
    enshrined in the Constitution, rather than established by statute,
    then a much more serious question regarding waiver would be
    presented.

    However, these questions need not be decided in this case because
    the record here clearly establishes a waiver of the right to proceed
    pro se, even if such right is deemed Constitutional in nature.

    In*Duncan* the Supreme Court stated: A right to jury trial is
    granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the
    Government. Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and
    experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded
    criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too
    responsive to the voice of higher authority. \* \* \* Providing an
    accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him
    an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous
    prosecutor and against the complaint, biased, or eccentric judge. \*
    \* \* Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal
    Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law
    in this insistence upon community participation in the determination
    of guilt or innocence.

    Justice Brennan, recognizing the importance of orderly trials, also

    And Justice Douglas, also cognizant of the threat posed by the
    strategy of disruption, stated in a separate opinion:

    > "I agree with the Court that a criminal trial, in the
    > constitutional sense, cannot take place where the courtroom is a
    > bedlam and either the accused or the judge is hurling epithets at

[^94]: **^1^** Initially, both Jones and Atkins were indicted for
    capital murder. The prosecution ultimately permitted Jones to plead
    guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for his testimony against
    Atkins. As a result of the plea, Jones became ineligible to receive
    the death penalty.

[^95]: **^2^** Highly damaging to the credibility of Atkins' testimony
    was its substantial inconsistency with the statement he gave to the

    initial statement to the authorities.

[^98]: **^3^** The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR)
    defines mental retardation as follows: *"Mental retardation* refers
    to substantial limitations in present functioning. It is
    characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,
    existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the
    following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care,
    home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health
    and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work. Mental
    retardation manifests before age 18." Mental Retardation:
    Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed.
    1992).

    The American Psychiatric Association's definition is similar: "The
    essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage
    general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied
    by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two
    of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living,
    social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources,
    self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health,
    and safety (Criterion B). The onset must occur before age 18 years
    (Criterion C). Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and
    may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological
    processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous
    system." Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41
    (4th ed. 2000). "Mild" mental retardation is typically used to
    describe people with an IQ level of 50-55 to approximately 70.*Id.,*

[^100]: **^21^** Additional evidence makes it clear that this
    legislative judgment reflects a much broader social and professional
    consensus. For example, several organizations with germane expertise
    have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death
    penalty upon a mentally retarded offender. See Brief for American
    Psychological Association et al. as *Amici Curiae;* Brief for AAMR
    et al. as *Amici Curiae.* In addition, representatives of widely
    diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting
    Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an
    *amicus curiae* brief explaining that even though their views about
    the death penalty differ, they all "share a conviction that the
    execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally
    justified." Brief for United States Catholic Conference et al. as
    *Amici Curiae* 2. Moreover, within the world community, the
    imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally
    retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved. Brief for European
    Union as *Amicus Curiae* 4. Finally, polling data shows a widespread
    consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty,
    that executing the mentally retarded is wrong. Bonner & Rimer,

    their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further
    support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who
    have addressed the issue. See *Thompson* v. *Oklahoma,* 487 U. S.

    *(People* v. *Barry,* 94 Cal. 481, 482 \[29 P. 1026\]; see 1 Witkin,
    Cal. Crimes (1963) p. 414; 1 Cooley's Blackstone, pp. 223-228;
    comment, 25 So.Cal.L.Rev. 75.) Burglary under Penal Code section 459
    differs from common law burglary in that the entry m.ay be in the
    daytime and of numerous places other than a mansion house (see 1
    Witkin, *supra,* pp. 416-41?), and breaking is not required (see
    *People* v. *Allison,* 200 Cal. 404, 408 \[253 P. 318\].) For
    example, under section 459 a person who enters a store with the
    intent of committing theft is guilty of burglary. (See *People* v.
    *Corral,* 60 Cal.App.2d 66 \[140 P.2d 172\].) It would seem absurd
    to hold that a store detective could kill that person if necessary
    to prevent him from committing that offense. (See 13 Stan.L.Rev.
    566, 579.)
