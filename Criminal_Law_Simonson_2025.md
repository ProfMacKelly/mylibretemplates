Introduction, from Alice Ristroph, Criminal Law: An Integrated Approach

 

## What is criminal law?

Of the various subjects a student encounters in an American law school,
*criminal law* may appear the most familiar. From an early age, every
American is exposed to depictions of various aspects of the criminal
legal system. Police (and "robbers" and "burglars") appear in children's
books and toys. Criminal investigations and prosecutions are dramatized
in television and movies. In the news media, there is ample, perhaps
exaggerated, coverage of crimes, arrests, trials, and punishments.
Criminal law appears everywhere, in part because in the United States it
*is* nearly everywhere: this country uses criminal legal interventions
with a frequency and severity unmatched in most other nations. For this
reason, many of the ideas and terms you encounter in this book will be
ones you're likely to have heard before: *charges*, *conviction*,
*presumption of innocence*, *proof beyond a reasonable doubt*, to give a
few examples---along with terms of critique such as *mass incarceration*
and *racial bias* and *overcriminalization*.

Criminal law seems familiar, but the apparent familiarity can be
misleading. . . .Notwithstanding the seeming familiarity of criminal
law, many students eventually find the subject to be very different from
what they expected "law" to be. To minimize confusion, it is useful to
begin with some basic descriptions. What makes criminal law the same as
other areas of law? That is, what makes it *law*? And what makes
criminal law different from other areas of law? What makes *criminal*
law a distinctive field?

Philosophers have no single answer to the question, *what is law*, and
dictionaries identify the word as one with multiple meanings. We speak
of the laws of physics, for example, but those statements about the
observed properties of physical objects are very different from the
kinds of laws that one studies in law school. For the purposes of this
\[course\], law can be understood as a human practice that involves both
authoritative written texts and decisions by public officials. Text and
decision: it will be important to keep both in mind as you study
criminal law.

In law, texts and decisions interact in a number of different ways. For
example, a statute that defines "burglary" is a written text, and it is
designed to guide official decisions by police officers, prosecutors,
and judges. Official decisions are often but not always guided by a
preexisting written text; sometimes public officials make decisions
without statu- tory or other written guidance. And official decisions
are sometimes, but only sometimes, recorded in a new written text.
Decisions by police officers are often unrecorded, or recorded in a
document such as an arrest report that is soon lost to history, whereas
courts frequently announce and explain their decisions in written
opinions that are preserved for much longer periods. This latter kind of
text, the judicial opinion or "case," makes up much of law school
reading assignments. But cases are not the only written texts that are
important to the practice of law, and judicial decisions are not the
only decisions that are important to law. In criminal law (and many
other fields), statutes are especially important legal texts. And in
criminal law (and many other fields), decisions by executive branch
officials are often determinative of legal outcomes. . . .

Here, then, is one way in which criminal law is like other areas of law
that you will encounter in law school: it is a distinctive human
practice that involves the use of written texts to guide, constrain, or
express official decisions and actions. It bears emphasis that the
decisions reached in law are decisions made by human beings. Humans are
rational creatures who can deliberate about moral values, or take into
account empirical evidence, or be influenced by public opinion, or rely
on "common sense" as they make legal decisions. But human rationality is
bounded, or limited by various factors such as imperfect information and
cognitive biases. Human law, unlike the laws of physics, thus reflects
various characteristics of human decisionmaking that are also observable
in other contexts, such as the influence of emotion and cognitive
biases. Racial bias is a particularly acute concern in criminal law. . .
. Perhaps criminal law is even more shaped by emotion and cognitive bias
than other fields of human law; we will explore that possibility. For
now, the key point is that legal texts are designed to guide human
decisionmaking, but the relevant text may not be the only factor that
shapes an official decision.

What (beyond the possibility of unusual effects of bias and emotion)
distinguishes *criminal* law from other fields of human law? Criminal
law was once more commonly called "the law of crimes," and the concept
of a crime may help us identify what is distinctive about criminal law.
In popular culture and lay parlance, the term crime is likely to bring
to mind images of wrongful or harmful acts. It is tempting to think of
criminal law as the law that regulates (by prohibiting) acts of violence
or other inflictions of serious harm. Certainly many cultural depictions
of crime encourage that view, equating crime with murder, rape, or other
grave physical harms. But in legal terms, a crime is any act that has
been designated as a crime by the appropriate legal actors. Many acts
designated as crimes do not involve any physical harm, or even conduct
that is widely viewed as harmful. Public intoxication, or "loitering,"
or a failure to file required paperwork, are all acts designated as
criminal . . . .

Whether or not the acts designated as criminal are in fact wrongful or
harmful in all cases, the designation of a person as "a criminal" brings
significant negative consequences to that person in all or nearly all
cases. Criminal law is often said to be distinctive in imposing unique
burdens, such as loss of liberty through a jail or prison sentence. Even
when a person convicted of a criminal offense avoids incarceration, a
criminal conviction carries considerable stigma and often renders a
person ineligible for various social benefits.

Indeed, the burdens of a criminal conviction are a key part of the
distinction between criminal law and tort law. Tort law, which you are
likely to study in your first year of law school, is similar to criminal
law in that it imposes legal liability for conduct designated as
wrongful. In fact, the modern English word "tort" comes from the Latin
term *torquere* (to twist, or distort) and its past participle *tortum*
(wrong or injustice). Many acts could be classified as both crimes and
torts, such as intentional inflictions of physical injury. But tort law
is different from criminal law in at least two key respects. First, the
sanctions are different. Tort liability usually means having to pay
monetary damages to the injured party, but it does not involve custodial
detention or the stigma of a criminal con- viction. To be sure, criminal
punishment can take the form of a fine, or monetary restitution to a
victim, so the fact that a person has to pay money for some wrongdoing
does not itself distinguish crimes from torts. But criminal sanctions
often involve not monetary payments (or, not only monetary payments) but
physical detention, in a jail or prison. Additionally, there is a stigma
associated with a criminal conviction that is not typically associated
with being found liable for a tort. Thus, the severity and stigma of
criminal sanctions may be one point of distinction from tort law. A
second way in which tort law is different from criminal law is that the
decision to pursue a tort claim is usually the choice of a private
party, not a public official. Police and prosecutors decide whether a
given individual will be investigated and charged with a crime, but the
individual or pri- vate party who is harmed by tortious conduct decides
whether to file a tort suit.

Because the burdens of a criminal conviction are seen as more severe
than the burdens typically imposed by non-criminal laws, criminal law
contains various structures designed to limit the imposition of criminal
penalties. For example, criminal punishment is said to require a higher
standard of proof than is required in many other areas of law. That's
the *beyond a reasonable doubt* standard that you're likely to have
heard invoked before. This is another way in which criminal law differs
from tort law, and it may explain why some defendants are acquitted of
criminal charges but found civilly liable for the same conduct in a tort
suit. (O.J. Simpson is a famous example: he was acquitted of the murders
of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman, but Simpson was found liable
for the deaths in a subsequent civil tort suit with a lower standard of
proof.)  . . . \[W\]e will encounter several cases that address
constitutional principles arguably designed to limit the imposition of
criminal law's distinctively severe penalties. As you read those cases,
you will gain a better understanding of how the United States has
developed its extensive system of criminal legal interventions,
notwithstanding ostensible limits on the use of criminal sanctions.

. . . \[W\]e will consider three types of official decisions that are
especially important to criminal law. For any individual person to be
convicted of a crime, each of these three decisions is necessary. First,
the *criminalization* decision is the choice to define some
category        of conduct as criminal. Today, this decision usually
must be made by a legislature and expressed in a criminal statute, but
we will see . . . that criminalization decisions have not always
required legislative action or a written statute.

Criminal statutes (or other texts that define activity as criminal) are
not self-enforcing. For example, the existence of a statute that
criminalizes the possession of cocaine is not by itself enough to ensure
that all persons who possess cocaine will be convicted of violating that
statute. Accordingly, a second type of decision key to criminal law is
the *enforcement* decision, or the decision by enforcement agents such
as police and prosecutors to arrest or charge a given person. In
practice, a single criminal case often involves multiple enforcement
decisions: the decision by a police officer to investigate and perhaps
arrest a person; the decision by a prosecutor to charge a particular
offense; and in many instances, later decisions by a prosecutor to add
or drop charges as part of a plea bargaining process.

Plea bargaining is often (but not always) a precursor to the third key
decision, the *adjudication* decision, in which a formal, and often
final, decision is made to classify the defendant as guilty or not
guilty. If a criminal case involves a jury trial, then it is the jury
who makes the adjudication decision. Some criminal cases involve bench
trials, in which a judge serves as the factfinder and decides whether to
convict the defendant or not. But the vast majority of criminal
convictions are based on guilty pleas rather than jury or bench trials.
When a defendant pleads guilty, it is more difficult to identify the
actor who makes the adjudication decision. It could be said that the
defendant himself (or herself) makes the adjudication decision, since
the defendant admits his own guilt instead of asking a jury or judge to
determine guilt. But what would lead a defendant to do that? In a system
that promises that every defendant will be presumed innocent until
proven guilty, why do so many defendants plead guilty, disclaim their
own innocence, and relieve prosecutors of their burden to prove guilt? .
. . It will turn out that *criminalization decisions* and *enforce- ment
decisions* can create situations in which *adjudication decisions* all
but disappear -- choices about what to criminalize, and how to enforce
those laws, can make a guilty plea rather than a trial the least
terrible option for many a defendant. For now, it is important simply to
note that the distinctive standard of proof mentioned above -- proof
beyond a reasonable doubt -- does not actually get tested in most
criminal cases. Prosecutors don't have to "prove" anything if a
defendant pleads guilty.

In a nutshell, then, criminal law is a human practice which involves
three important types of decisions: *criminalization*, *enforcement*,
and *adjudication*. Any of these decisions may be guided by, or recorded
in, an official text, but texts will not always determine how the
decisions are made.

Alexandra Natapoff, Punishment without Crime

 

**[[Natapoff, Punishment Without Crime]{.smallcaps} ch.1
(2018)]{.underline}**

 One of the great myths of our criminal system is that minor arrests and
convictions are not especially terrible for the people who experience
them. It is a highly influential myth. It helps justify the speed and
sloppiness of misdemeanor processing. It supports the assignment of the
least-experienced prosecutors and public defenders to misdemeanor
dockets. It makes pleading guilty seem sensible so as to avoid the
difficult and expensive process of contesting a case. It even explains
the Supreme Court's habit of withholding constitutional rights from
misdemeanor defendants. The Court has held that people who face less
than six months' imprisonment have no right to a jury trial. If they are
not incarcerated for a misdemeanor, they have no right to a lawyer. In
effect, when the law deems *punishment* not particularly burdensome, it
makes it easier to *convict* people in the first place.

 

But misdemeanor punishments are not petty at all. People with minor
arrests and convictions are jailed, fined, supervised, tracked, marked,
and stigmatized. They can lose their jobs, driver's licenses, welfare
benefits, child custody, immigration status, and housing. They may be
disqualified for loans and professional licenses or sink into debt and
ruin their credit. Sometimes these things happen even when their cases
are dismissed and they are never convicted at all.

 

Current US law barely acknowledges the broad punitive impact of the
misdemeanor experience. Criminal law draws a line between formal legal
"punishment"---the jail time, probation, and fines imposed by a judge
when someone is convicted---and all the other "collateral consequences"
of that conviction. But in the misdemeanor arena such legal distinctions
obscure the sprawling reality of the punishment experience. The full
impact of a misdemeanor begins long before people are convicted and ends
long after they have served their sentences. It can amount to a crushing
burden, heavier than the punishment ordered by the court and often
wildly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense.

 

A misdemeanor's impact can flow from many different sources. We'll look
at the main categories that make up the punishment experience: jail,
probation, fines and fees, warrants, criminal records, the loss of
public benefits, immigration consequences, future encounters with the
criminal system, and, finally, the fear and stigma that go with it all.

 

**JAIL**

 

Tyrone Tomlin was a fifty-three-year-old construction worker in
Brooklyn, New York. One afternoon in late November 2014, chatting with
friends, he popped into the corner store to buy a soda. When he came
out, two undercover police officers were frisking his friends. An
officer took Tomlin's soda. "What you got in the other hand?" the
officer asked. "I got a straw that I'm about to use for the soda," said
Tomlin. The office searched Tomlin and arrested him for the straw. "Drug
paraphernalia," the officer explained.

 

When Tomlin got to court, the prosecutor offered him a thirty-day
sentence if he pled guilty. He wouldn't, but Tomlin couldn't afford the
\$1,500 bail set by the judge, so he was sent to Riker's Island, New
York's infamously violent jail complex. He went back to court on
November 25, two days before Thanksgiving. There was still no drug
evidence, but the government continued to insist on a plea; Tomlin
continued to insist that he was innocent, but since he still couldn't
make bail, back to Riker's he went. Days later, he was jumped by a group
of inmates in the shower who punched, kicked, and stomped him in his
head and his eyes. When Tomlin went to court two weeks later, his eye
was still swollen shut. At that hearing, however, the prosecution
produced a report from the police lab confirming that the straw was just
a straw: "No Controlled Substance Identified" was written at the top of
the report in bold. The report had been faxed to the district attorney
on November 25, the very same day that Tomlin was in court before the
beating, but no one had picked it up. Now the government dismissed the
case. At the time, Tomlin was relieved. "It feels great to go home," he
said.

 

Six months later, Tomlin's eye remained askew, and his sight was blurry.
"I still feel the aftereffects," he said. "Pain \[in\] my eye, in my
head." Now that the threat of Riker's had passed, he was thinking about
the fact that he got locked up and beaten up, lost three weeks of
salary, and missed Thanksgiving with his family, all because he could
not afford to pay bail. "I got a raw deal,\" he concluded, but he was
philosophical. "I'm not Johnny Rich-Kid with a silver spoon. Sure, yeah,
I'm mad about it. But that's the way it is. I've got to accept it. It's
not right, but that's the way it is." He shrugged. "What are you going
to do?"

 

Jail is one of the most damaging aspects of the misdemeanor experience,
and it looms large throughout. It is where you go when you are arrested,
where you stay if you can't make bail, where you will serve your
sentence if convicted, and where you might end up if you can't pay your
fine. Jails are different from prisons. Prison is where people serve
felony sentences, and the US prison population of 1.5 million has made
this country internationally infamous. But there are 11 million
admissions to 3,000 American jails every year---on any given day,
approximately 730,000 people are in jail. On average, approximately
one-third of them are there for misdemeanors, but in some cities it is
as many as 50 percent. Sixty percent---nearly half a million
people---are incarcerated pretrial; like Tyrone Tomlin they have not
been convicted of anything and are thus presumptively innocent.

 

\* \* \*

 

As Tyrone Tomlin's story illustrates, jail is intimately connected to
the phenomenon of bail. Bail is supposed to be a kind of good faith down
payment---an amount of money set by the court to ensure that defendants
show up for future court appearances. Defendants who can afford to pay
it get released. When their case is over, they get it back. \* \* \* For
people who don't have the money, however, the cost of bail creates
pressure to plead guilty. Most misdemeanor defendants who are set bail
cannot pay it, so they either plead out or stay in jail until their
cases are over.

 

The impact of going to jail is substantial, both for individuals and
their families. Studies have shown that as few as twenty-four hours of
pretrial detention can have negative effects. Longer stays are highly
disruptive and can lead to evictions, towed cars, and the loss of food
stamps and other resources. More than 5 million children have seen a
parent go to jail or prison. In 2009, over 400,000 parents were in local
jails. Incarcerated parents can lose custody or visitation rights or
face further incarceration for failing to pay child support that accrued
while they were in jail. In sum, whether incarceration occurs before or
after conviction, going to jail is an enormously costly aspect of the
misdemeanor experience.

 

**PROBATION**

 

Sometimes people are sentenced not to jail but to probation, a period of
court-ordered supervision. While it can be a way of avoiding
incarceration, probation carries its own unique burdens. In 2014, for
example, Danyelle and Roland Hall threw a Christmas Day party for
friends and family. Afterward, Hall drove two of her guests home and was
stopped for driving thirty-eight in a twenty-five-mph zone. A
breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol content of .09, just over the
Maryland legal limit of .07, the difference of about one glass of wine.

 

Although Hall had no criminal record and no history of alcohol use, she
was sentenced to eighteen months' probation---if she completed it
successfully, the case would be dismissed, and she would avoid a
criminal record. The conditions of that probation included \$105 a month
in supervision fees, twenty-six weeks of alcohol education at \$280 a
month, \$252 in court costs, and three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a
week. If Hall wanted to change addresses, she would need the judge's
permission. Hall also owed \$2,000 to the bail bondsman and \$1,500 to
her lawyer. Because her license was suspended for two weeks, she lost
her job as a nurse's aide, making it difficult for her husband to pay
those costs.

 

After she had been in compliance for several months, Hall's apartment
developed a mouse infestation. She wrote to the court explaining her
intention to move, but the court issued a summons stating that she did
not have permission to change her address. When Hall lost the paperwork
proving her attendance at the AA meetings, the judge issued a warrant
for her arrest. Hall went to jail for a month, and the judge entered the
conviction onto her record. As a result, her driver's license was
suspended for six months. Because she couldn't drive to work, she lost
her new job.

 

Probation, sometimes referred to as community supervision, is the most
common misdemeanor sentence other than fines. The federal Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) reports that approximately 4 million Americans
are on some form of probationary supervision, nearly half of them for
misdemeanors, but this is an undercount since many low-level probations
are not reported to BJS at all.

 

Probation is often seen as a lenient sentence because it permits people
to avoid jail time, but as Donyelle Hall's story reveals, it can be
expensive, burdensome, and intrusive. Probationers lose their privacy
rights: probation officers can search them and their homes at any time.
Probation usually requires periodic drug tests, visits to the probation
office, electronic monitoring, counseling, fines, or other conditions
that can be difficult to meet, especially for low-income and
working-class probationers. A typical misdemeanor probation term can
last from six months to a year or more. During that time, violation of
any condition, including failure to pay fines and fees, can subject the
defendant to incarceration; only about two-thirds of probationers
successfully complete their terms.

 

**FINES, FEES, AND THE NEW DEBTORS' PRISON**

 

\* \* \*

 

\[F\]ines are a widely used form of punishment that imposes hundreds and
sometimes thousands of dollars of debt on misdemeanor offenders.
California alone has \$10 billion in outstanding unpaid traffic debt.
The practice can have far-reaching consequences because so many people
cannot afford to pay. Low-income defendants are punished not only with
their original fine but with long-term debt, loss of credit, or pressure
to forgo rent payments or other necessities such as food, health care,
and education. If people do not pay, they may be jailed.

 

In contrast to fines, fees are technically not punishment: they are
instead financial charges imposed on defendants by courts, jails,
cities, public defenders, prosecutors, probation officers, and clerks to
pay for the operations of the criminal process itself. They can include
court costs, fees for using the public defender, supervision or "tether"
fees, drug testing fees, electronic monitoring fees, warrant fees, jail
fees, and late fees. Total fees can far exceed any fine. \* \* \*

 

Thousands of people \* \* \* end up incarcerated every year because they
cannot afford to pay fines and fees. Often their incarceration becomes a
way of paying off their debt: some states offer a \$50 or \$100 credit
for every day spent in jail. Because this kind of debt-based
incarceration only occurs when people are too poor to pay, the
phenomenon is commonly referred to as the new debtors' prison.

 

**WARRANTS**

 

The failure to pay a misdemeanor fine or to show up in court for a minor
offense can also trigger the issuance of a warrant, which is a court
order authorizing the person's arrest at any time by any police officer.
There are millions of such outstanding warrants in the United States,
and they have wide legal and practical ramifications. \* \* \*

 

Some places use warrants more than others. In Texas, the city of El Paso
issues 87,000 warrants per year in a city of 680,000 residents. In New
York City alone, there are over 1.2 million outstanding warrants; in
Pennsylvania, 1.4 million; in California, 2.5 million. Pine Lawn, a
small town in St. Louis County near Ferguson, had 23,457 outstanding
warrants pending in 2013---more than seven per resident. These warrants
subject people to being stopped and arrested at any time.

 

\* \* \*

 

**CRIMINAL RECORDS AND EMPLOYMENT**

 

Perhaps the best-known informal consequence of a criminal conviction is
its impact on employment. Job listings on Craigslist often warn people
with misdemeanors not to bother applying: "No Exceptions! \* \* \* No
Misdemeanors and/or Felonies of any type ever in background"; "Do Not
Apply with Any Misdemeanors/Felonies"; and "You must not have any felony
or misdemeanor convictions your record. Period."

 

Such barriers can last a long time. Johnny Magee was forty years old
when he picked up a package for his uncle. Unbeknownst to Magee, who is
developmentally disabled, the package contained drugs. Magee was
convicted of misdemeanor conspiracy---the only contact with drugs or the
criminal system he ever had. But nine years later, Lowe's home
improvement store still wouldn't give him a job in its garden center.
"Lowe's policy is unfair to me and lots of other people," says Magee.
"It's unfair because they only see something that happened to me many
years ago, even though I've never been in trouble since."

 

Over 65 million Americans have a criminal record, the majority for
misdemeanors. These low-level convictions increasingly inhibit
employment. Most employers now use criminal background checks. Indeed,
some insurance companies require employers to conduct checks as a
condition of their coverage. And online searches and commercial
databases make access to criminal records easy.

 

\* \* \*

 

The growing reliance on criminal records means that even very low-level
conduct can trigger widespread employment disqualifications. After
September 11, 2001, for example, the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly
expanded its background check procedures to include misdemeanors. This
resulted in the banning of a number of employees from Eli Lilly
facilities, including a woman whose only offense was a misdemeanor
conviction for a \$60 bounced check to a refrigerator rental company,
which she said occurred because she closed the account without realizing
that the check had not yet cleared.

 

\* \* \*

 

**LOSING PUBLIC BENEFITS**

 

A misdemeanor conviction or probation violation disqualifies a person
from a wide range of benefits and opportunities. Under federal law, any
probation violation for any type of  misdemeanor disqualifies an
individual from welfare benefits, including Temporary Assistance to
Needy Families, food stamps, low-income housing, Supplemental Security
Income for the elderly and disabled. The consequences of a drug
misdemeanor conviction are particularly harsh and can include the loss
of health-care coverage, welfare, and student financial aid.

 

Marisa Garcia, for instance, was a month away from starting freshman
year of college. It was also her nineteenth birthday, and she and her
friends were out celebrating. But when they stopped for gas, police
parked behind their van. "Eventually they started searching the car,"
Garcia remembers. "There was a little coin purse, with a small pipe with
ash in it." It was hers.

 

Garcia had never been in trouble before and did not want to tell her
mother, so she went to court alone, without a lawyer, and pled guilty
immediately. She paid a \$400 fine. Two months later, a letter from the
federal financial aid office arrived, asking whether she had a drug
conviction. "My heart kind of stopped," she says. Garcia lost her
financial aid for a year. Her mother, already supporting four children,
took out a loan to pay Garcia's tuition.

 

Garcia feels that she was punished twice: first with the fine and then
again, far more severely, with the loss of her financial aid. If she had
been richer, she could have paid for a drug-treatment program, which
would have let her get her aid back sooner. "I still would have been
arrested for marijuana," she muses, "but if I was wealthier, I could go
out and do whatever I wanted and just be punished once."

 

The Council of State Governments maintains a database of the collateral
legal consequences of a criminal conviction; that database counts 8,958
different statutory provisions across the country that disqualify people
with various misdemeanor convictions from professional occupations,
housing opportunities, educational programs, and other benefits. \* \*
\*

 

One of the most devastating consequences of a low-level conviction can
be the loss of housing, both private and public. Like employers, private
landlords have easy access to criminal records; criminal background
checks are a routine aspect of lease applications. For public housing, a
conviction can cut off access by law. A conviction for disorderly
conduct makes a person presumptively ineligible for New York City public
housing for two years. In Baltimore, a misdemeanor conviction
disqualifies a person from public housing for eighteen months.

 

**IMMIGRATION**

 

The misdemeanor net puts immigrants at an especially heightened risk
because it touches so many people and imposes criminal convictions for
such low-level conduct. Hundreds of thousands of noncitizens are
deported every year, the majority of them triggered by an arrest or
conviction for minor offenses.

 

One of those people was Elizabeth Perez's husband. "We were supposed to
do this together," said Perez, as her three-year-old son tugged on her
long hair and her four-year-old daughter screamed for attention. "Raise
the kids, I mean." Perez was thirty-five years old, an American-born
former marine who served in Afghanistan. She lived in Painesville, Ohio.
Her husband was deported to Mexico in 2010 after the police detained him
during a traffic stop. He had fourteen year-old misdemeanor charges for
assault and marijuana possession. "It's been hard without my husband
here," said Perez.

 

Legal residents can lose their immigration status if they sustain a
misdemeanor conviction. As one scholar describes it, deportable offenses
include "misdemeanor drug possession\[,\] \* \* \* theft of a ten-dollar
video game, shoplifting fifteen dollars worth of baby clothes, \* \* \*
forging a check for less than twenty dollars \* \* \* theft of services
offenses like turnstile jumping, misdemeanor indecent exposure, \[and\]
petty shoplifting offenses." Undocumented immigrants, meanwhile, can
face deportation if they are taken into government custody for something
as minor as speeding. From 2009 to 2014, nearly 200,000 people were
deported \[as\] a result of being arrested solely for a traffic offense.

 

\* \* \*

 

A misdemeanor arrest or conviction can completely alter an individual's
immigration outlook. For undocumented defendants who are jailed on minor
offenses but who have not yet come to the attention of immigration
authorities, there is massive pressure to plead guilty immediately in
the hope of avoiding an immigration warrant, called a detainer. Small
plea bargain details, moreover, can have big immigration consequences
for legal residents. Subtracting a single day from a 365-day sentence
can transform a deportable offense into a non-deportable one. Attorneys
can bargain a minor marijuana-possession charge into a disorderly
conduct charge to spare the defendant automatic deportation.

 

\* \* \*

 

**FUTURE ENCOUNTERS**

 

After a misdemeanor conviction, a person's interactions with the
criminal process will never be the same. Police are more likely to
arrest individuals who have prior low-level convictions rather than
letting them walk away or merely issuing a ticket. Prosecutors are more
likely to seek bail or to charge them with more serious crimes. Judges
typically impose longer sentences on people who have prior convictions,
even minor convictions not involving a lawyer.

 

\* \* \*

 

These ratcheting dynamics are particularly destructive where people and
neighborhoods are heavily policed. In places like Baltimore and
Brooklyn, where African American men are stopped more often than
average, their chances of getting an initial low-level conviction rise
accordingly. The next time they are stopped, they have already been
marked by the process and will be treated more harshly. The more times
this happens, the harsher the system will act. For example, the New York
City Transit Police Department operates on a recidivism policy. The
first time people are stopped in the subway for a fare violation, they
will be given a ticket. If they have a prior transit violation or
arrest, however, they will be arrested. Because the New York Police
Department has a history of racially disproportionate stops and
arrests---92 percent of turnstile-jumping tickets are issued to people
of color, who comprise 66 percent of city residents---this recidivism
policy ensures that people of color will continue to be arrested at
higher rates. This type of negative feedback loop imposes long records
and increasingly harsh sentences not because people have become more
dangerous or worse offenders but because the system is responding to its
own cues and criminalizing and recriminalizing the same people over and
over.

 

**FEAR, STIGMA, AND CIVIC DISRESPECT**

 

By now it should be clear how many concrete burdens and disabilities are
triggered by the misdemeanor experience. Being labeled a criminal,
however, inflicts its own special psychological and social wounds.

 

Legal scholar Paul Butler has shared his own experiences. As law
professors go, Butler is indisputably prominent. Educated at Yale and
Harvard, a former federal prosecutor, and now an eminent scholar at
Georgetown Law School, he appears routinely on national television and
in national newspapers. Back in 1993, however, an unsavory neighbor
falsely accused him of misdemeanor assault. After being arrested and
released on his own recognizance, Butler went home and cried. "If I get
convicted of this crime---this stupid little misdemeanor," he thought,
"life as I know it is over." He hired one of the best criminal defense
attorneys in Washington, DC, and a private investigator. Even so, he
stayed frightened and uncertain right up until the moment of his
acquittal. He later wrote that he knew that his innocence was "beside
the point." Afterward, despite his acquittal and stellar background, he
never quite recovered. "I'm not as innocent as I was before," he
concluded. "I have a record."

 

Even for highly educated, well-resourced professionals like Butler, the
misdemeanor process can be painful and alienating. For the less
educated, less wealthy people who are even more likely to encounter the
system, it is often confusing, frightening, and disrespectful. Recall
the story at the beginning of this book of Grandma G, who was led
sobbing and in handcuffs out of the courtroom after a proceeding she did
not understand and no one bothered to explain to her. For those with
criminal records who have been through the process before, repeated
exposure to the criminal system is a special trauma its own. As legal
scholar Jonathan Simon puts it, "The whole structure of misdemeanor
justice \* \* \* seems intended to subject the urban poor to a series of
petty but cumulative blows to their dignity as citizens of equal
standing."

 

\* \* \*

 

Contact with the criminal system also changes people's relationship to
government; indeed, it can taint their very understanding of democratic
society and their place in it. People who have been arrested and
convicted may avoid institutions that keep formal records, such as
banks, hospitals, and schools, exhibiting what one scholar calls "system
avoidance." Studies show that people who have gone through the criminal
system, even for minor offenses, distrust the government more and
participate less in politics. As one interviewee explained, the
unresponsive, heavy-handed criminal system is "the only government I
know." Others are even more pessimistic: "All we know about government
is bad. We don't know the good aspects." The petty-offense process
teaches this cynical, destructive lesson in civics to 13 million
Americans every year.

 

It is a lesson that has been taught in lower courts for a long time. In
1979, sociologist Malcolm Feeley wrote a famous book about the
misdemeanor court in New Haven, Connecticut, called *The Process the
Punishment.* His title captured the fact that merely being hauled into
court and going through the judicial process was often more punitive
than any formal sentence the judge might impose. Even when their cases
were dismissed, people had already been punished simply by being forced
to show up and account for themselves. Feeley argued that the judicial
process itself---not the formal conviction or punishment---was in many
ways the point of the exercise, a way of managing poor, disadvantaged,
or disorderly people regardless of whether they were legally guilty.

 

Feeley's aphorism is even truer today. The petty-offense process starts
"punishing" people long before they get to court, and it keeps punishing
them long after they have completed their court-imposed sentences. It
can even punish those who are never convicted of anything. Being
stopped, arrested, cited, jailed, posting bail, telling your
employer---these experiences take a heavy personal and social toll. The
damaging consequences of a brush with the criminal system kick in from
the very beginning. Indeed, for people of color, immigrants, and others
who fully expect to be touched by the criminal system, fear of the
inevitable encounter can haunt them long before it ever takes place.
Afterward, the repercussions continue long after the legal punishment is
over. The formal mark of an arrest or conviction record lasts a
lifetime; the psychological and economic burdens of being convicted can
last just as long. The total impact of these burdens and exclusions can
be so great as to amount to what some call a "new civil death," a
permanent barrier to full civic and economic participation.

Technically speaking, the law does not recognize all these different
hardships as punishment; nor does it acknowledge the many ways that we
punish without crime. From the law's formal perspective, Tyrone Tomlin's
eye injury doesn't count. Donyelle Hall losing her job doesn't count.
Neither does Marisa Garcia losing her financial aid. The impact on their
families doesn't count either. But as these stories reveal, a legalistic
approach misses the true punitive weight and extent of the misdemeanor
experience for those who actually go through it. An encounter with the
misdemeanor system for even the pettiest conduct can derail a person's
life.

Ewing v. California

 

Supreme Court of the United States

538 U.S. 11, 155 L. Ed. 2d 108, 123 S. Ct. 1179, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 1952,
SCDB 2002-028

No. 01-6978

2003-03-05

Argued November 5, 2002

Justice O'Connor

announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which
The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join.

In this case, we decide whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the State
of California from sentencing a repeat felon to a prison term of 25
years to life under the State's "Three Strikes and You're Out" law.

**\[ ... \]**

In October and November 1993, Ewing committed three burglaries and one
robbery at a Long Beach, California, apartment complex over a 5-week
period. He awakened one of his victims, asleep on her living room sofa,
as he tried to disconnect her video cassette recorder from the
television in that room. When she screamed, Ewing ran out the front
door. On another occasion, Ewing accosted a victim in the mailroom of
the apartment complex. Ewing claimed to have a gun and ordered the
victim to hand over his wallet. When the victim resisted, Ewing produced
a knife and forced the victim back to the apartment itself. While Ewing
rifled through the bedroom, the victim fled the apartment screaming for
help. Ewing absconded with the victim's money and credit cards.

On December 9,1993, Ewing was arrested on the premises of the apartment
complex for trespassing and lying to a police officer. The knife used in
the robbery and a glass cocaine pipe were later found in the back seat
of the patrol car used to transport Ewing to the police station. A jury
convicted Ewing of first-degree robbery and three counts of residential
burglary. Sentenced to nine years and eight months in prison, Ewing was
paroled in 1999.

Only 10 months later, Ewing stole the golf clubs at issue in this case.
He was charged with, and ultimately convicted of, one count of felony
grand theft of personal property in excess of \$400. See Cal. Penal Code
Ann. § 484**\[ ... \]**. As required by the three strikes law, the
prosecutor formally alleged, and the trial court later found, that Ewing
had been convicted previously of four serious or violent felonies for
the three burglaries and the robbery in the Long Beach apartment
complex. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

III

Against this backdrop, we consider Ewing's claim that his three strikes
sentence of 25 years to life is unconstitutionally disproportionate to
his offense of "shoplifting three golf clubs." **\[ ... \]**At the
threshold, we note that Ewing incorrectly frames the issue. The gravity
of his offense was not merely "shoplifting three golf clubs." Rather,
Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for- stealing nearly \$1,200
worth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at least
two "violent" or "serious" felonies. **\[ ... \]**

In weighing the gravity of Ewing's offense, we must place on the scales
not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony
recidivism. Any other approach would fail to accord proper deference to
the policy judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of
sanctions. In imposing a three strikes sentence, the State's interest is
not merely punishing the offense of conviction, or the "triggering"
offense: "\[I\]t is in addition the interest\... in dealing in a harsher
manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are
simply incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by
its criminal law." **\[ ... \]** To give full effect to the State's
choice of this legitimate penological goal, our proportionality review
of Ewing's sentence must take that goal into account.

Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in
incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons, and amply supported by
his own long, serious criminal record.[^1] Ewing has been convicted of
numerous misdemeanor and felony offenses, served nine separate terms of
incarceration, and committed most of his crimes while on probation or
parole. His prior "strikes" were serious felonies including robbery and
three residential burglaries. To be sure, Ewing's sentence is a long
one. But it reflects a rational legislative judgment, entitled to
deference, that offenders who have committed serious or violent felonies
and who continue to commit felonies must be incapacitated. The State of
California "was entitled to place upon \[Ewing\] the onus of one who is
simply unable to bring his conduct within the social norms prescribed by
the criminal law of the State." **\[ ... \]** Ewing's is not "the rare
case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the
sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportion-ality."
**\[ ... \]**

We hold that Ewing's sentence of 25 years to life in prison, imposed for
the offense of felony grand theft under the three strikes law, is not
grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The judgment
of the California Court of Appeal is affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

[**\[ ... \]**](#X5e3234f82ff746379c66bd29346bee020d08a07)

Justice Scalia,

concurring in the judgment.

**\[ ... \]**

Proportionality --- the notion that the punishment should fit the crime
--- is inherently a concept tied to the penological goal of retribution.
"\[I\]t becomes difficult even to speak intelligently of
'proportionality,' once deterrence and rehabilitation are given
significant weight," **\[ ... \]** --- not to mention giving weight to
the purpose of California's three strikes law: incapacitation. In the
present case, the game is up once the plurality has acknowledged that
"the Constitution does not mandate adoption of any one penological
theory," and that a "sentence can have a variety of justifications, such
as incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, or rehabilitation." *Ante,*
at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). That acknowledgment having
been made, it no longer suffices merely to assess "the gravity of the
offense compared to the harshness of the penalty," *ante,* at 28; that
classic description of the proportionality principle (alone and in
itself quite resistant to policy-free, legal analysis) now becomes
merely the "first" step of the inquiry, *ibid.* Having completed that
step (by a discussion which, in all fairness, does not convincingly
establish that 25-years-to-life is a "proportionate" punishment for
stealing three golf clubs), the plurality must then *add* an analysis to
show that "Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety
interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons." *Ante,* at
29.

Which indeed it is --- though why that has anything to do with the
principle of proportionality is a mystery. Perhaps the plurality should
revise its terminology, so that what it reads into the Eighth Amendment
is not the unstated proposition that all punishment should be reasonably
proportionate to the gravity of the offense, but rather the unstated
proposition that all punishment should reasonably pursue the multiple
purposes of the criminal law. That formulation would make it clearer
than ever, of course, that the plurality is not applying law but
evaluating policy.

Because I agree that petitioner's sentence does not violate the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, I concur
in the judgment.

Frase on Punishment Purposes

 

Here is one account, from Prof. Richard Frase, of the traditional set of
ideas for why the state punishes people under the Criminal Law. This is
an excerpt from Richard S. Frase, [Punishment Purposes]{.underline}, 58
Stan. L. Rev. 67, 69--74 (2005):

1.  **Overview of Contemporary Sentencing Purposes and Limitations**

.. Why should violators of criminal laws be punished, and what
principles should be recognized to limit the type and degree of
punishment? Punishment purposes and limitations are traditionally
grouped in two categories: utilitarian and nonutilitarian. Utilitarian
purposes and limitations seek to achieve beneficial effects (or a net
benefit) and, in particular, lower frequency and/or seriousness of
future criminal acts by this offender or others. Nonutilitarian
punishment purposes and limitations embody principles of justice and
fairness which are viewed as ends in themselves, without regard to
whether they produce any particular social or individual benefit.

..

1.  **Utilitarian Purposes and Limitations**

The most widely adopted utilitarian sentencing principles focus on using
criminal penalties to prevent or lessen the seriousness of future
criminal acts by the offender being sentenced and/or by other, would-be
offenders. Criminal penalties have the potential to achieve these
crime-control effects through at least five causal mechanisms:
rehabilitation, incapacitation, specific deterrence, general deterrence,
and denunciation. Each of these methods depends on certain critical
assumptions and conditions for its effectiveness.

The first three methods seek to prevent future crimes by this particular
offender; these methods thus assume both that certain defendants have an
elevated risk of reoffending (justifying special measures addressed
toward them specifically) and that these offenders and their degree of
elevated risk can be identified in advance. Rehabilitation further
assumes that the offender has identifiable and treatable problems which
cause him to commit crimes; this approach seeks to reduce the
offender\'s future criminality by addressing those causes through
education and treatment in prison or in a nonprison program.
Incapacitation prevents crime by imprisoning high-risk offenders, thus
physically restraining them from committing further crimes against the
public. This crime-control method assumes not only that such offenders
can be reliably identified but also that they are not made worse by
imprisonment, and that\-- while in custody\--they are not replaced by
other offenders. Specific deterrence (also known as special or
individual deterrence) seeks to discourage the defendant from committing
further crimes by instilling fear of receiving the same or a more severe
penalty in the future.

. . . The fourth and fifth crime-control methods, general deterrence and
denunciation, are designed to prevent future crimes by members of the
public at large or certain subgroups believed to have an elevated risk
of offending. General deterrence seeks to discourage would-be offenders
from committing further crimes by instilling a fear of receiving the
penalty given to this offender. General deterrent effects depend on a
number of factors: the severity of the penalty; the swiftness with which
it is imposed; the probability of being caught and punished; the target
group\'s perceptions of the severity, swiftness, and certainty of
punishment; the extent to which members of the target group suffer from
addiction, mental illness, or other conditions which significantly
diminish their capacity to obey the law; and the extent to which these
would-be offenders face competing pressures or incentives to commit
crime. As a result of the combined impact of these factors, some
offenses and offenders are likely to be easily deterred by the threat of
criminal penalties; at the other extreme, some offenses and offenders
are essentially undeterrable.

Several of the deterrence factors listed above interact. For example, a
major increase in penalty severity may cause a decrease in the swiftness
and/or certainty of punishment. This is because severe penalties give
offenders a stronger incentive to vigorously contest the charges and may
make prosecutors, judges, and juries reluctant to consistently impose
such penalties. Research has found that offenders are more sensitive to
the probability of punishment than to its severity. Thus, increased
severity may cause crime rates to remain the same or even increase.

Punishment can also prevent crime by means of more diffuse processes
that depend on internalized values rather than fear of punishment.
Through denunciation (also referred to as the communicative, educative,
or expressive function of punishment, or as positive general prevention)
criminal penalties serve to define and reinforce important social norms
of law-abiding behavior and relative crime seriousness. . . .

In addition to crime control, sentences may achieve several other
important utilitarian purposes: promoting satisfaction, closure, and/or
compensation for crime victims and victimized communities; reassuring
the public that something is being done about crime; and facilitating
the offender\'s successful reintegration into society. Each of these
effects is desirable for its own sake but may also help to prevent
future crimes by the defendant or other would-be offenders.

Utilitarian theory also imposes several important limitations on the
form or severity of punishment. Criminal penalties should not cost more
than the benefits they achieve or cause individual or social harms which
outweigh their crime-controlling effects or other benefits. Punishment
should also be efficient. Penalties should not be more severe or more
costly than necessary; if the same crime-control and other benefits can
be achieved with less severe or less costly methods, those methods
should be preferred. In a world of limited resources, punishment must
also be prioritized. Prison beds and other scarce correctional resources
should be reserved for the most socially harmful offenses and offenders.
Prisons must also not be used beyond their effective capacities.
Overcrowded prisons are unsafe for prisoners and staff, and reduced
security and resources for programming increase the odds that prisoners
will leave prison more violent or antisocial than when they entered.
(Overcrowded prisons are also likely to violate nonutilitarian
principles, in particular the right to humane treatment discussed
below.)

1.  **Nonutilitarian Purposes and Limitations**

Retribution is the most widely recognized nonutilitarian sentencing
principle. Under this theory, offenders should be punished in proportion
to their blameworthiness (or desert) in committing the crime being
sentenced. Two basic elements determine an offender\'s degree of
blameworthiness: the nature and seriousness of the harm caused or
threatened by the crime and the offender\'s degree of culpability in
committing the crime. Culpability depends on several factors: the
offender\'s intent (deliberate wrongdoing is more culpable than criminal
negligence); his or her capacity to obey the law (which may be
diminished by mental disease or defect, chemical dependency, or
situational factors such as threats or other strong inducements to
commit the crime); the offender\'s motives for committing the crime
(which may mitigate or aggravate culpability); and, for multi-defendant
crimes, the defendant\'s role in the offense as instigator, leader,
follower, primary actor, or minor player.

Retribution can serve both as a purpose (positive justification) for
punishment and as a limitation on penalties imposed to achieve other
purposes. The purpose theory views retribution as the primary or even
exclusive goal of punishment\-- offenders are punished simply because
they deserve to be and the severity of their punishment should be no
more and no less than they deserve. The underlying moral arguments
supporting this view often involve claims of fairness: fairness to the
victim and the victim\'s family (whose right to seek vengeance is
supplanted by the criminal law); fairness to law-abiding persons (who
refrained from committing this offense); and fairness to the defendant
(who, according to this theory, has a right to be punished in proportion
to his blameworthiness).

. . . the limiting (negative) version of retributive theory merely sets
outer limits on punishment, defining a range of permissible severity for
any given case. In terms of the fairness arguments summarized above,
retributive limits defining the minimum acceptable penalty reflect
concerns about fairness to victims, law-abiding persons, and other
offenders; upper-retributive limits, defining the maximum allowable
penalty, reflect the widely shared sense that it is fundamentally unfair
and an abuse of governmental power to punish an offender more severely
than he deserves.

Uniformity is another very important nonutilitarian sentencing
principle. . .  This combination of retributive and uniformity
principles is often called the Theory of Just Deserts; offenders of
comparable blameworthiness (in terms of social harm and offender
culpability) should receive similar penalties, and offenders differing
in blameworthiness should be punished in proportion to their respective
degrees of blame. . . .

The civil and human rights of defendants provide another set of
nonutilitarian limiting principles. The requirement of humane treatment
forbids torture, dismemberment, and other brutal physical or
psychological punishments, without regard to whether some offenders
might be thought to deserve such penalties or whether the penalties
could be deemed necessary and effective to achieve crime control or
other utilitarian purposes. Convicts also retain First Amendment and
other civil rights which may limit the form or conditions of punishment.

Allegra McLeod, Prison Abolition and Grounded Justice

 

Excerpt from: Allegra M. McLeod, *Prison Abolition and Grounded
Justice*, 62 UCLA L. Rev. 1156, 1158--60 (2015)

 

In 1973, the U.S. Department of Justice sponsored a National Advisory
Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals to study the
"American Correctional System," and after extensive research and
analysis, the Commission published a report concluding that U.S.
prisons, juvenile detention centers, and jails had established a
"shocking record of failure." The Commission recommended a moratorium on
prison construction to last ten years. Instead, as a vast and compelling
body of scholarship attests, in the years to follow, both prison
construction and the U.S. prison population\-- characterized by stark
racial disparities\--boomed. Forty years later, one in every thirty-five
American adults was under criminal supervision of some form. Penal
intervention had become even more alarmingly prevalent among African
American men. According to some estimates, one of every three young
African American men may expect to spend part of his life in prison or
jail.

Apart from the inhumanity of incarceration, there is good reason to
doubt the efficacy of incarceration and prison-backed policing as means
of managing the complex social problems they are tasked with addressing,
whether interpersonal violence, addiction, mental illness, or sexual
abuse. Moreover, beyond prisons and jails, broader reliance on punitive
policing to handle myriad social problems leads to routine use of
excessive police force and to volatile, often violent, police-citizen
relations. Yet, despite persistent and increasing recognition of the
problems that attend incarceration and punitive policing in the United
States, . . . abandoning carceral punishment and punitive policing
remains generally unfathomable.

If prison abolition is conceptualized as an immediate and indiscriminate
opening of prison doors\--that is, the imminent physical elimination of
all structures of incarceration\-- rejection of abolition is perhaps
warranted. But abolition may be understood instead as a gradual project
of decarceration, in which radically different legal and institutional
regulatory forms supplant criminal law enforcement. These institutional
alternatives include meaningful justice reinvestment to strengthen the
social arm of the state and improve human welfare; decriminalizing less
serious infractions; improved design of spaces and products to reduce
opportunities for offending; urban redevelopment and "greening"
projects; proliferating restorative forms of redress; and creating both
safe harbors for individuals at risk of or fleeing violence and
alternative livelihoods for persons otherwise subject to criminal law
enforcement. When abolition is conceptualized in these terms\--as a
transformative goal of gradual decarceration and positive regulatory
substitution wherein penal regulation is recognized as morally
unsustainable\--then inattention to abolition . . . comes into focus as
a more troubling absence. Further, the rejection of abolition as a
horizon for reform mistakenly assumes that reformist critiques concern
only the occasional, peripheral excesses of imprisonment and
prison-backed policing rather than more fundamentally impugning the core
operations of criminal law enforcement, and therefore requiring a
departure from prison-backed criminal regulation to other regulatory
frameworks.

The New Sundown Towns

 

[Tracy Rosenthal ](https://newrepublic.com/authors/tracy-rosenthal)/
from the New Republic

April 30, 2024

USUAL CRUELTY

The New Sundown Towns

As Grants Pass, Oregon---and the nation---await a Supreme Court ruling
on just how far cities can police the homeless, a volunteer mayor and
her unhoused constituents try to weather the backlash.

\-\--

On July 24, 2018, Debra Blake was banished from every park in Grants
Pass, Oregon. She added the exclusion order to a growing pile of
violations---for sleeping, sitting, camping, and trespassing, a mix of
civil and criminal charges that accrued late fees, bench warrants, and
jail stints, wrecked her credit and job prospects, and made her a known
entity to police. At 59, Blake had lived in Grants Pass for almost 15
years, seven without a home. She
didn't [qualify](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.140855/gov.uscourts.ord.140855.1.0_1.pdf) for
a bed in the town's only shelter, and there was no place she could
legally rest outdoors. "It seemed like everywhere she camped she would
get tickets," a friend of hers told me. "Every night. Everywhere.
Anytime the cops caught her, she was in the wrong place."

In fall 2018,
Blake [sued](https://www.vox.com/2023/7/5/23778810/homelessness-california-unsheltered-research) the
city for violating her constitutional rights. Friends described her to
me as "motherly," "selfless," and "a force to be reckoned with." By
then, Blake owed the city \$4,000 in fines. "I am afraid at all times in
Grants Pass that I could be arrested, ticketed, and prosecuted for
sleeping outside or for covering myself with a blanket to stay warm,"
she testified in the lawsuit. She wasn't alone. "I have met dozens, if
not hundreds, of homeless people in Grants Pass," she said. "They have
all had similar experiences." In September 2019, her debt cresting
\$5,000, Blake was banished from the parks a second time. She sought
refuge beyond city limits, in places she feared were "not physically
safe ... far from food and other services."

Banishment of unhoused people was the point, her class-action suit
argued. Ahead of the tourist season in spring 2013, officials had held
a [roundtable](https://www.grantspassoregon.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Minutes/181?MOBILE=ON) on
the city's "vagrancy problems." Meeting minutes rehearse now-standard
talking points in our national homelessness crisis. A councilman
explained the utility of punishment: "Until the pain of staying the same
outweighs the pain of changing, people will not change." The deputy
police chief suggested a "sobering center" that would house people in "a
jail cell with steel doors." Other officials urged banning food
distribution ("If you stop feeding them, then they will stop coming")
and posting "zero tolerance" signs at all entrances to the city. Grants
Pass redesigned its municipal code to incorporate these ideas. "The
point," one councilman said, was "to make it uncomfortable enough for
them in our city so they will want to move on down the road."

Blake won her case. As Ed Johnson,
Blake's [lawyer](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2024/04/with-oregon-homelessness-case-headed-to-supreme-court-spotlight-falls-on-portland-lawyer-unhoused-people-in-grants-pass.html) at
the Oregon Law Center, told me, Grants Pass had managed to design a "set
of ordinances that made it illegal to survive on every inch of public
land 24 hours a day." In 2020, the Oregon District Court ruled that the
imposed fees were excessive, that exclusion orders violated due process,
and that blanket criminalization constituted cruel and unusual
punishment against those "engaging in the unavoidable, biological,
life-sustaining acts of sleeping and resting." Blake passed away before
she could see the results: an injunction that allows homeless people to
rest in Grants Pass parks for 24 hours at a time, as long as there is
nowhere else for them to go. Her friend said it felt as if unhoused
people "didn't have to hide anymore."

and sheriffs' associations, archconservative think tanks like the
Goldwater Institute, the liberal cities of San Francisco and Los
Angeles, and California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.

Homelessness policies that fail drive electoral success, and politicians
can claim an empty sidewalk---and an unsolved crisis---as a political
victory.

Now a town of fewer than 40,000 people may get to rewrite the scripts of
homelessness policy for the entire United States. When the court rules,
likely in late June, unhoused people could lose the Eighth Amendment as
a bulwark against widespread criminalization and encampment sweeps. But
Grants Pass's current practices, even under the injunction, suggest
cruelty is rarely unusual. The embattled Oregon town is a microcosm of
the drama now playing out among politicians, their constituents, and the
fast-growing number of people who live in public space. In this
bipartisan production, homelessness is portrayed as something police can
deter and rehabilitation can cure. Homelessness policies that fail drive
electoral success, and politicians can claim an empty sidewalk---and an
unsolved crisis---as a political victory.

Grants Pass's mayor, Sara Bristol, often wears an expression of amused
exasperation. The day we met, she'd tried to dispel a Facebook rumor
that nonprofit warming shelters would house undocumented immigrants. She
often finds herself disputing the claim that homeless people in town are
outsiders. Born in Grants Pass, not registered with either party,
Bristol was elected just as the injunction settled into place, turning
new clusters of tents---on green spaces abutting the Rogue River, on
muddy dirt by the ball fields, on the grass strip of a road
median---into Bristolvilles. In fall 2023, a group of residents
campaigned for her recall, gathering signatures under signs that read
TAKE BACK OUR PARKS.
Bristol [maintained](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/09/13/grants-pass-mayor-appears-survive-recall-election/) her
mandate.

...Over the last 20 years, Grants Pass nearly doubled in size. Almost a
third of renters spend [more than
half](https://www.kdrv.com/video/grants-pass-works-on-rent-burden/video_4d30577a-6418-5086-acd9-3fcfd1658a34.html) their
income on rent. The most recent "Point in Time" count logged more than
500 homeless people, a number that the count's coordinator said was
certainly an underestimation, conducted at the height of winter, when
people seek shelter anywhere they can find it. Many don't want to be
found.

The city is an odd estuary of lawn-sign liberals and flag-flying
conservatives. During the 2020 uprisings against police violence, an
open-carry guard convened at the 140-foot American flag on Union
Avenue, [patrolling](https://scheerpost.com/2020/06/03/tiny-oregon-town-holds-armed-rally-to-defend-flag-against-feared-invasion/) the
roof of the local Baskin-Robbins. The county boasts the lowest property
taxes in the state and hosts two secessionist movements. . . . Residents
often pointed me to the legacy of the Ku Klux Klan. One unhoused person
I met told me his grandfather had been a wizard.

The first time Bristol used her power to break a City Council tie, she
voted to install portable toilets in the city's parks. Some residents
and officials warned the move would "encourage" homelessness, but,
Bristol said, "nobody's going to come live in Grants Pass, Oregon,
because they heard there's a Porta Potty in Riverside Park."
Nonetheless, that "if you build it, they will come" fear has suffused
public comment periods, inspired town ordinances, and compromised
resources from the state. When the Oregon
legislature [earmarked](https://josephinedemocrats.org/commissioners-attack-grants-pass-mayor-for-trying-to-get-homeless-funds/) \$200
million for homelessness, county supervisors refused to issue a required
"state of emergency" declaration or send in an application for the
funds.

"Public health, mental health, housing services are not things that the
city of Grants Pass provide, but we do have parks," Bristol said. "The
city doesn't want our parks to become homeless camps." . . .
\[O\]rganizers continue to protest at the parks. Vigilantes honk their
horns, throw trash, and yell "carp," meaning "bottom-feeders," from
their cars. Residents circulate photos of unhoused people on social
media; one Facebook group promotes citizens taking matters into their
own hands, even "final answers." Bristol suggested I contact David
Dapper. She did not mention that, in 2021, Dapper had been arrested at
Tussing Park for pointing a gun at unhoused people, including one
pregnant woman,
and [firing](https://kobi5.com/news/married-couple-arrested-after-shots-fired-in-grants-pass-park-police-say-151514/) into
the air.

Laws targeting the homeless have surged alongside homelessness itself:
The number of bans on camping, resting, standing around, and asking for
money all [just about
doubled](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/AG-2021/06-08_Criminalization-of-Homelessness.pdf) between
2006 and 2019. But some laws have
been [overturned](https://homelesslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Housing-Not-Handcuffs-Litigation-Manual.pdf) by
the courts. Lawyers leveraged the First Amendment to protect panhandling
and handing out food; the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to prevent
belongings from getting destroyed in sweeps. The United States
Constitution, Shayla Myers of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles
said, "provides that last line of defense" for unhoused people's civil
liberties.

In September 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
issued a landmark ruling governing the Western United States, where more
than half of all unsheltered homeless people in the country reside. The
court [determined](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/09/04/15-35845.pdf) in *Martin
v. Boise *that criminalizing the "involuntary ... unavoidable
consequence of being homeless," sleeping in public, when there was no
"adequate" alternative place to go, violated the Eighth Amendment's
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The district court and
appellate court rulings against the city of Grants Pass built on this
foundation. (After Debra Blake's death, the case was named *City of
Grants Pass v. Johnson* for another unhoused plaintiff, Gloria Johnson.)
The city's ordinances had attempted to distinguish the necessity
"sleeping" from voluntary "camping," the latter signaled by the presence
of anything that would separate a person from the elements, including a
tent, a bedroll, cardboard, or a blanket. But staying warm and dry, the
courts said, was as necessary as rest. The town's use of civil rather
than criminal penalties could not evade the amendment either.

. . . Theane Evangelis wrote in an email to me that Eighth Amendment
rulings "are harming the very people they purport to protect." A white
paper Evangelis
co-wrote [expands](https://www.gibsondunn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Evangelis-Hamburger-Breaking-the-Legal-Paralysis-Combatting-Californias-Homelessness-Crisis-After-Martin-v.-City-of-Boise-California-Real-Property-Journal-July-2021.pdf) on
this view: Camping bans are "decades-old, ordinary, municipal laws" that
prevent the spread of encampments, incubators of deadly diseases and
drug use that victimize unhoused people and threaten surrounding
residents and businesses. The paper also highlights the "axiomatic"
function of anti-homeless laws as deterrence: Like laws against every
other criminal activity, the threat of punishment dissuades people from
living on the streets. Eighth Amendment rulings, by contrast, are an
invitation tantamount to "a constitutional right to camp in public."

But even under the rulings, the authors observed, cities are free to
issue time, manner, and place restrictions on people sleeping or camping
in public space. And the rulings have "no effect on laws prohibiting
drug dealing, violent criminal activity, and conduct that poses
environmental and health hazards."

...\[T\]here is often little daylight between Democrats and Republicans
in their efforts to engineer cities as sundown towns. It wasn't Idaho
where unhoused people first called on the Eighth Amendment to protect
themselves from criminalization; that distinction was California's. In a
2007 settlement, the court struck down 41.18, Los Angeles's "sit-lie"
law, a ban on sitting, sleeping, lying, and storing property in public.
San Francisco now boasts 24 unique anti-homeless laws. Recent reports
show unhoused people account for a disproportionate number of arrests,
even in liberal strongholds: one in six in L.A., and one in two in
Portland.

. . . Liberal cities met *Martin* not as an opportunity to diversify
their efforts to house people, but to creatively remove them within the
confines of the law. In 2021, Los
Angeles [updated](https://11thdistrict.com/4118-faq/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711327544811278&usg=AOvVaw1zNyPtyI43-Ev83JoU3WOH) its
sit-lie law with exclusion zones---around parks, schools, libraries,
underpasses, and shelters---which effectively if not
technically [blanket](https://antievictionmap.com/services-not-sweeps) the
city. Other cities responded to *Martin*'s demand that unhoused people
need "alternative" places to sleep before they can be ticketed or
arrested by codifying it into a cold calculus of beds versus tents. Both
San Diego and Las Vegas now issue misdemeanors for camping if shelter
space exists. "The right to shelter must be paired with the obligation
to use it," Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg has said. In other words,
unhoused people must accept shelter at the penalty of fines or
imprisonment.

Democrats have their own rhetoric of deterrence, a "tough love"
imbrication of coercion and care. Criminalization, San Francisco
explains in its brief in the *Grants Pass* case, is essential "to
encourage individuals ... to accept services." This model fastens the
stick of policing to the carrot of shelter and rehabilitation.
Punishment helps unhoused people make a choice that ultimately serves
them. One sociologist termed this approach "therapeutic policing."

But research shows that
criminalization [perpetuates](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/67/1/131/5422958?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) rather
than discourages homelessness, disqualifying unhoused people from the
support they need, including federal housing benefits. A criminal record
and credit scores wrecked by civil debt mean fewer employers or
landlords willing to give them a chance. In the short term, arrests and
sweeps interrupt the efforts of service providers. Unhoused people lose
medication, critical documents, survival gear, and fragile support
networks, losses that compound the physical and emotional toll of living
outdoors.

When voters demand action on homelessness, sweeps are a useful but
temporary fix; politicians keen to show progress on the issue resort to
shuffling the problem around. In two years, according to L.A.'s [own
data](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24453676/4118-efficacy-summary-report.pdf),
81 percent of encampments reemerged after "sit-lie" enforcement. In
Seattle, exclusion orders
ultimately [failed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286187988_Banished_The_New_Social_Control_in_Urban_America) to
prevent people from living in parks. In one San Francisco study, most of
the 350 homeless people interviewed said sweeps pushed them just a few
blocks away.

When sweeps fail, politicians blame the courts. In August 2023, Mayor
Breed [joined](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-homeless-crisis-sweeps-lawsuit-aclu-breed-18310974.php) a
protest on the steps of the Ninth Circuit Court, decrying a recent
injunction, which found that the city would sweep, cite, and arrest
unhoused people when no alternative shelter existed to offer them; the
wait list for its shelters was 1,000 people long. Standing in front of a
sign that read DON'T RYUN SF (after Judge Donna Ryu, who issued the
order), Breed accused the courts of "micromanag\[ing\]" her efforts to
clear encampments. She was "sick and tired of being sick and tired," she
said, quoting civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer.

With a flurry of final, mostly neutral briefs sent to the court this
spring, liberal cities supported the *Grants Pass* case as a vehicle to
limit or clarify lower court rulings. San Francisco's brief demanded the
freedom "to enforce the will" of its voters. Los Angeles asked whether a
count of all homeless individuals is required every day before it can
enforce its laws. (The city has three times more unhoused people than
shelter beds.) Shayla Myers called these bids disingenuous, even
dangerous: No court has blocked anything besides blanket restrictions,
cities have ample room to say where unhoused people can be, and the
Supreme Court is in a frenzy of "overturning rights."

California's Governor Newsom sent his own plea that the court take the
case, [admitting](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/15/gavin-newsom-interview-transcript-00116347) it
was a "hell of a statement for a progressive Democrat." His final,
neutral brief insists that he does not support the criminalization of
homelessness. But his warning that lower courts have erected a
"roadblock" that "hamstring\[s\]" cities echoes Grants Pass's own suit,
which uses the same words; Grants Pass's attorney, who says they've
"tied the hands" of officials; and the dissenting Ninth Circuit judge,
who [wrote](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2023/07/9th-circuit-court-declines-to-rehear-ruling-that-upheld-homeless-right-to-sleep-outside-when-no-shelter-space-available.html)
that while *Martin* "handcuffed local jurisdictions," *Grants
Pass* "places them in a straitjacket."

"I'm in the cyclical hell that everyone else is in," John Babb told me.
That morning, his and every other tent in Baker Park had been
orange-tagged. Around 7 a.m., Grants Pass police made their twice-weekly
rounds, issuing notices to pack up and move. The "Public Notice of
Illegal Camping," printed on 8 x 10 orange copy paper, instructs
recipients, "Your campsite is subject to involuntary removal" 72 hours
after issuance.

A "compulsive rule follower," Babb had situated his tent strategically:
a dozen feet away from the banks of the Rogue River, far enough from
Department of Transportation property under the bridge and the two
"buffer zones" surrounding the paths on either side of him. I sat on a
thick navy blue poster board rolled out in front of his tent. Babb, in a
waffle-knit long sleeve and narrow black jeans, kept the door flap
around him like a shawl. The night's temperatures had dropped into the
20s, and the morning sun was only just breaking up the chill.

Despite her detractors' accusations of leniency, Mayor Bristol has
overseen a crackdown on encampments. Forcing houseless people to
relocate, Bristol said, "helps make it so that people don't have a sense
of permanency, like they own that square of the park." Even under the
injunction, the city can issue tickets for illegal camping with 24
hours' notice. In a nearly five-hour council meeting in June 2023, the
city introduced further rules. It prohibited "scattering rubbish," using
propane heaters, and public needle exchanges (which
can [halve](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/22/a-new-drug-war-in-oregon) the
spread of HIV and hepatitis C); it established "buffer zones" around
walkways and pavilions; and it limited park users to taking up a total
spatial footprint of eight feet by eight feet. Police had made rounds
sizing up tents to inform the decision: "Six by eight looked OK to me,"
the chief explained. "Ten by 10 did not look OK to me." Most violations
earn a ticket for \$295---\$537 if left unpaid. During public comment,
one resident argued: "Rights aren't given; they're earned with
responsibilities. Everybody has to earn their rights."

Two police officers, Tim Artoff and Jason McGinnis, make up Grants
Pass's Community Response Team, dedicated to enforcing the city's
ordinances at its parks. (Neither the officers nor the police chief
responded to interview requests.) Babb went to high school with Artoff,
whom Babb remembers with a mullet and acne. Every unhoused person I
talked to knew both officers by name. The entire Grants Pass police
force has fewer than 60 officers; about six are on patrol at a time. In
short, a full third of the city's resources for public safety---itself
almost a third of the city's budget---are directed to policing its
unhoused residents.

Babb had just passed his two-year anniversary of living outside. When he
lost both his parents, whom he called his "best friends," he couldn't
remain in the house they shared. Then the city impounded his car, and he
went from "cushy homeless" to living outdoors. Without the care of his
mother, he had to face the challenge of "learning to adult" at 52. Babb
was ambivalent about standing out in the community as "an English
major," an "Eskimo," and gay. People "go out of their way to paint
everyone with the same brush, like, 'Well, they just don't want to work.
They're useless drug addicts,'" he said. For the resources to stand up
for himself, he sometimes turned to Debra Blake's memory.

"With every fiber of my being, I know that I'm not going to be in this
circumstance forever," he said. But life outdoors puts up roadblocks to
getting out: "It's a vicious cycle.... It kind of compounds and
compounds." He has lost four IDs. Moving wears down his gear and
triggers his arthritis. His phone charger had been soaked through in a
recent storm---not that he could find somewhere to plug it in. The
city's ordinances, even under the injunction, erect their own obstacles.
"Two tickets. That's all I make in a year."

That morning, Babb had walked the half-mile to Riverside Park, where a
host of volunteers and nonprofits deliver the city's only services,
providing wound care and distributing groceries, gloves, and naloxone.
The city itself has restricted access to electricity, trash cans,
bathrooms, and running water at its parks. Asked about the specifics of
"scattering rubbish" violations, Artoff once said, "I don't know it by
heart.... It includes garbage and other items of personal property"---a
slippage between trash and houseless people's belongings. Of the
relentless cycle of sweeps, one person told me, "The cops run them
around like they're goddamn farm animals." People have to pick up
everything they own and move it between the only places they are allowed
to be---one pen to another.

Criminalizing homelessness is an increasingly organized effort on the
right. In 2021, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of the Palantir data analysis
company, [bankrolled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/22/rights-war-housing-first-lands-middle-america/) a
camping ban in Austin. He helped establish the Cicero Institute to take
that campaign national. Already passed, introduced, or adapted in 12
states, Cicero's template legislation bans camping statewide---at the
penalty of a \$5,000 fine and a month in prison---and redirects all but
10 percent of homelessness funding from permanent to temporary housing,
with mandatory drug treatment. One policy director summarized the
strategy as "treatment first, not Housing First."

Ironically, the right is seeking to undo a framework popularized under
George W. Bush. Before Bush, federal policies prioritized short-term
shelter, offering permanent housing as a reward for sobriety and
employment. Housing First promised the opposite: unconditional,
permanent housing with voluntary mental health and substance care.
Appeasing fiscal and humanitarian concerns and once enjoying bipartisan
support, Housing First has been shown to use public
resources [efficiently](https://phys.org/news/2016-10-reveals-big-economic-benefits-housing.html)---housing
people costs less than repeatedly incarcerating and hospitalizing
them---and to keep people housed over the long term. The framework has
been adopted widely. It's the official policy of the state of California
and the Department of Veterans Affairs. It gets preference for federal
grants. But no level of government has built anywhere near enough
permanent housing to keep pace with the growing number of houseless
people.

. . . Cutting swiftly between shots of unhoused people in distress, a
video by the Cicero Institute and PragerU warns that cities with rising
homeless populations "have one policy in common: Housing First." It
makes the case that homelessness "is not a poverty problem.... The root
of the problem is mental illness and addiction." Rejecting, in
Lonsdale's [words](https://www.city-journal.org/article/georgia-takes-a-stand-on-homeless-policy),
"the Marxist idea that American capitalism causes homelessness,"
conservatives insist that criminalization and mandatory treatment will
promote personal accountability and get people off the streets. . . .

Nationally, unhoused people with such problems are in
the [minority](https://www.samhsa.gov/blog/addressing-social-determinants-health-among-individuals-experiencing-homelessness):
21 percent struggle with a serious mental illness; 16 percent with
substance abuse. Studies reflect that forced treatment doesn't stop drug
use. Nor does drug treatment treat homelessness. Of almost 200,000
homeless people who entered substance treatment, one study demonstrated,
nearly 70
percent [remained](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.202100430) homeless
afterward. Treatment programs will also prove difficult to expand; they
already face critical staff shortages.

. . . David Peery, who served as class representative of unhoused people
in a suit against the city of Miami, locates unhoused people's struggles
with addiction in
the [experience](https://www.vox.com/2023/7/5/23778810/homelessness-california-unsheltered-research) of
living outdoors: They turn to substances when it's too cold or
uncomfortable to sleep, for help staying awake when there's no place to
rest, or to address pain when they can't access medical care. Without
stable housing, they look for the predictability of a hit. Recently,
concerns about unhoused people's drug use fueled a backlash against a
2020 Oregon state measure that had decriminalized possession of small
amounts of illicit drugs. Accused of enabling addiction and encouraging
public disorder, the measure now sits on the governor's desk for repeal.

The concerns echo in Grants Pass. The Sobering Center that the city
planned in its vagrancy roundtable opened its doors in 2016. The
facility consists of 12 locked rooms, where people can stay for up to 24
hours. Almost half of its nightly inhabitants are placed there by the
police. The town's only shelter, the Gospel Rescue Mission, has a
zero-tolerance approach: sobriety from drugs, alcohol,
even [nicotine](https://gospelrescuemissiongp.org/i-need-help/);
residents have to quit smoking to qualify for one of the 138 beds. The
"pray-to-stay" facility's 29 rules also include attending church
services that follow the dictates of the "Apostles' Creed," not
interacting with members of the opposite sex, and presenting oneself in
line with one's "birth gender." (I am personally out on three counts.)
Residents must work 40 hours a week at the mission and can't look for a
job elsewhere. Executive director Brian Bouteller defends his shelter's
strict rules and advocates stricter enforcement at parks. In a recent
video, he describes people living in the parks as "can and won't": They
can leave homelessness but won't, because they are receiving "free
needles," meals, and medical care.

. . . Ignoring the systemic math of tattered social safety nets,
stagnant wages, and rising rents, politicians often frame homelessness
as an individual choice, even a "lifestyle." Homeless people are deemed
"service resistant" when they choose a tent over a space indoors, even
when that space is temporary or separates them from their community or
belongings. . . .

Behavioral modification is as old as the poorhouse, where residents were
forced to break rocks to earn a shelter bed. I often fear the future of
homelessness policy may look like a regression into that past. Palantir
co-founder Joe
Lonsdale [speaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3PSd0YLxDA) wistfully
of the terms "vagrants, bums, tramps." London Breed just won mandatory
drug treatment for welfare recipients, a policy revived from the Reagan
years. Gavin Newsom is bent on reopening the asylums, shuttered slowly
after John F. Kennedy's term. Housing First's right-wing detractors
exploit a 1950s playbook of assaults on public housing. . . . At its
most expansive, Housing First could do what public housing promised,
ensuring no one went without a home. But local opposition, chronic
underfunding, and eligibility requirements that invite only the most
visibly homeless indoors have reduced Housing First, Uppsala's Don
Mitchell said, to yet another "treatment program," treating the visible
symptoms of homelessness rather than the disease. What is languishing
may not be unhoused people in public space, but a sense of political
possibility, constrained by the effort it takes just to stop things from
getting worse.

**\*2207** Many cities across the American West face a homelessness
crisis. The causes are varied and complex, the appropriate public
**\*2208** policy responses perhaps no less so. Like many local
governments, the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, has pursued a multifaceted
approach. Recently, it adopted various policies aimed at "protecting the
rights, dignity\[,\] and private property of the homeless." App. 152. It
appointed a "homeless community liaison" officer charged with ensuring
the homeless receive information about "assistance programs and other
resources" available to them through the city and its local shelter.
*Id*., at 152--153; Brief for Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission as
*Amicus Curiae* 2--3. And it adopted certain restrictions against
encampments on public property. App. 155--156. The Ninth Circuit,
however, held that the Eighth Amendment\'s Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause barred that last measure. With support from States and cities
across the country, Grants Pass urged this Court to review the Ninth
Circuit\'s decision. We take up that task now.

Some suggest that homelessness may be the "defining public health and
safety crisis in the western United States" today. [72 F.4th 868, 934
(CA9
2023)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2075522044&pubNum=0008173&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_8173_934&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_8173_934)
(Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). According to
the federal government, homelessness in this country has reached its
highest levels since the government began reporting data on the subject
in 2007. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Community
Planning & Development, T. de Sousa et al., The 2023 Annual Homeless
Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress 2--3 (2023). California alone is
home to around half of those in this Nation living without shelter on a
given night. *Id*., at 30. And each of the five States with the highest
rates of unsheltered homelessness in the country---California, Oregon,
Hawaii, Arizona, and Nevada---lies in the American West. *Id*., at 17.

Those experiencing homelessness may be as diverse as the Nation
itself---they are young and old and belong to all races and creeds.
People become homeless for a variety of reasons, too, many beyond their
control. Some have been affected by economic conditions, rising housing
costs, or natural disasters. *Id*., at 37; see Brief for United States
as *Amicus Curiae* 2--3. Some have been forced from their homes to
escape domestic violence and other forms of exploitation. *Ibid.* And
still others struggle with drug addiction and mental illness. By one
estimate, perhaps 78 percent of the unsheltered suffer from
mental-health issues, while 75 percent struggle with substance abuse.
See J. Rountree, N. Hess, & A. Lyke, Health Conditions Among Unsheltered
Adults in the U. S., Calif. Policy Lab, Policy Brief 5 (2019).

Those living without shelter often live together. L. Dunton et al.,
Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development &
Research, Exploring Homelessness Among People Living in Encampments and
Associated Cost 1 (2020) (2020 HUD Report). As the number of homeless
individuals has grown, the number of homeless encampments across the
country has increased as well, "in numbers not seen in almost a
century." *Ibid.* The unsheltered may coalesce in these encampments for
a range of reasons. Some value the "freedom" encampment living provides
compared with submitting to the rules shelters impose. Dept. of Housing
and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, R.
Cohen, W. Yetvin, & J. Khadduri, Understanding Encampments of People
Experiencing Homelessness and Community Responses 5 (2019). Others
report that encampments offer a "sense of community." *Id*., at 7. And
still others may seek them out for **\*2209** "dependable access to
illegal drugs." *Ibid.* In brief, the reasons why someone will go
without shelter on a given night vary widely by the person and by the
day. See *ibid*.

As the number and size of these encampments have grown, so have the
challenges they can pose for the homeless and others. We are told, for
example, that the "exponential increase in \... encampments in recent
years has resulted in an increase in crimes both against the homeless
and by the homeless." Brief for California State Sheriffs' Associations
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 21 (California Sheriffs Brief). California\'s
Governor reports that encampment inhabitants face heightened risks of
"sexual assault" and "subjugation to sex work." Brief for California
Governor G. Newsom as *Amicus Curiae* 11 (California Governor Brief).
And by one estimate, more than 40 percent of the shootings in Seattle in
early 2022 were linked to homeless encampments. Brief for Washington
State Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs as *Amicus Curiae* on
Pet. for Cert. 10 (Washington Sheriffs Brief).

Other challenges have arisen as well. Some city officials indicate that
encampments facilitate the distribution of drugs like heroin and
fentanyl, which have claimed the lives of so many Americans in recent
years. Brief for Office of the San Diego County District Attorney as
*Amicus Curiae* 17--19. Without running water or proper sanitation
facilities, too, diseases can sometimes spread in encampments and beyond
them. Various States say that they have seen
[typhus](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ic33f1dc0475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0),
shigella, trench fever, and other diseases reemerge on their city
streets. California Governor Brief 12; Brief for Idaho et al. as *Amici
Curiae* 7 (States Brief). . . . 

Communities of all sizes are grappling with how best to address
challenges like these. As they have throughout the Nation\'s history,
charitable organizations "serve as the backbone of the emergency shelter
system in this country," accounting for roughly 40 percent of the
country\'s shelter beds for single adults on a given night. See National
Alliance To End Homelessness, Faith-Based Organizations: Fundamental
Partners in Ending Homelessness 1 (2017). Many private organizations,
city officials, and States have worked, as well, to increase the
availability of affordable housing in order to provide more permanent
shelter for those in need. See Brief for Local Government Legal Center
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 4, 32 (Cities Brief). But many, too, have come
to the conclusion that, as they put it, "\[j\]ust building more shelter
beds and public housing options is almost certainly not the answer by
itself." *Id*., at 11.

As many cities see it, even as they have expanded shelter capacity and
other public services, their unsheltered populations have continued to
grow. *Id*., at 9--11. The city of Seattle, for example, reports that
**\*2210** roughly 60 percent of its offers of shelter have been
rejected in a recent year. See *id*., at 28, and n. 26. Officials in
Portland, Oregon, indicate that, between April 2022 and January 2024,
over 70 percent of their approximately 3,500 offers of shelter beds to
homeless individuals were declined. Brief for League of Oregon Cities et
al. as *Amici Curiae* 5 (Oregon Cities Brief). Other cities tell us that
"the vast majority of their homeless populations are not actively
seeking shelter and refuse all services." Brief for Thirteen California
Cities as *Amici Curiae* 3. Surveys cited by the Department of Justice
suggest that only "25--41 percent" of "homeless encampment residents"
"willingly" accept offers of shelter beds. See Dept. of Justice, Office
of Community Oriented Policing Services, S. Chamard, Homeless
Encampments 36 (2010).

The reasons why the unsheltered sometimes reject offers of assistance
may themselves be many and complex. Some may reject shelter because
accepting it would take them further from family and local ties. See
Brief for 57 Social Scientists as *Amici Curiae* 20. Some may decline
offers of assistance because of concerns for their safety or the rules
some shelters impose regarding curfews, drug use, or religious
practices. *Id.*, at 22; see Cities Brief 29. Other factors may also be
at play. But whatever the causes, local governments say, this dynamic
significantly complicates their efforts to address the challenges of
homelessness. See *id*., at 11.

Rather than focus on a single policy to meet the challenges associated
with homelessness, many States and cities have pursued a range of
policies and programs. See 2020 HUD Report 14--20. Beyond expanding
shelter and affordable housing opportunities, some have reinvested in
mental-health and substance-abuse treatment programs. See Brief for
California State Association of Counties et al. as *Amici Curiae* 20,
25; see also 2020 HUD Report 23. Some have trained their employees in
outreach tactics designed to improve relations between governments and
the homeless they serve. *Ibid.* And still others have chosen to pair
these efforts with the enforcement of laws that restrict camping in
public places, like parks, streets, and sidewalks. Cities Brief 11.

Laws like those are commonplace. By one count, "a majority of cities
have laws restricting camping in public spaces," and nearly forty
percent "have one or more laws prohibiting camping citywide." See Brief
for Western Regional Advocacy Project as *Amicus Curiae* 7, n. 15
(emphasis deleted). 

Different governments may use these laws in different ways and to
varying degrees. See Cities Brief 11. But many broadly agree that
"policymakers need access to the full panoply of tools in the policy
toolbox" to "tackle the complicated issues of housing and homelessness."

Five years ago, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took
one of those tools off the table. In [*Martin v. Boise*, 920 F.3d 584
(2019)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
that court considered a public-camping ordinance in Boise, Idaho, that
made it a misdemeanor to use "streets, sidewalks, parks, or public
places" for "camping." [*Id*., at
603](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_506_603&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_506_603)
(internal quotation marks omitted). According to the Ninth Circuit, the
Eighth Amendment\'s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause barred Boise
from enforcing its public-camping ordinance against homeless individuals
who lacked "access to alternative shelter." [*Id.*, at
615](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_506_615&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_506_615).
That "access" was lacking, the court said, whenever " 'there is a
greater number of homeless individuals in a jurisdiction than the number
of available beds in shelters.' " [*Id.*, at
617](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_506_617&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_506_617)
(alterations omitted). According to the Ninth Circuit, nearly three
quarters of Boise\'s shelter beds were not "practically available"
because the city\'s charitable shelters had a "religious atmosphere."
[*Id*., at 609--610,
618](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_506_609&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_506_609).
Boise was thus enjoined from enforcing its camping laws against the
plaintiffs.

injunction issued against the city of Grants Pass. Located on the banks
of the Rogue River in southwestern Oregon, the city is home to roughly
38,000 people. Among them are an estimated 600 individuals who
experience homelessness on a given day. [72 F.4th, at

App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a--168a; 212a--213a.

Like many American cities, Grants Pass has laws restricting camping in
public spaces. Three are relevant here. The first prohibits sleeping "on
public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways." Grants Pass Municipal Code §
5.61.020(A) (2023); App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a. The second prohibits
"\[c\]amping" on public property. § 5.61.030; App. to Pet. for Cert.
222a (boldface deleted). Camping is defined as "set\[ting\] up \... or
remain\[ing\] in or at a campsite," and a "\[c\]ampsite" is defined as
"any place where bedding, sleeping bag\[s\], or other material used for
bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed \... for the purpose of
maintaining a temporary place to live." §§ 5.61.010(A)--(B); App. to
Pet. for Cert. 221a. The third prohibits "\[c\]amping" and
"\[o\]vernight parking" in the city\'s parks. §§ 6.46.090(A)--(B); [72
F.4th, at
876](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2075522044&pubNum=0008173&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_8173_876&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_8173_876).
Penalties for violating these ordinances escalate stepwise. An initial
violation may trigger a fine. §§ 1.36.010(I)--(J). Those who receive
multiple citations may be subject to an order barring them from city
parks for 30 days. § 6.46.350; App. to Pet. for Cert. 174a. And, in
turn, violations of those orders can constitute criminal trespass,
punishable by a maximum of 30 days in prison and a \$1,250 fine. [Ore.

two homeless individuals, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, filed suit
challenging the city\'s public-camping laws. App. 37, Third Amended
Complaint ¶¶6--7. They claimed, among other things, that the city\'s
ordinances violated the Eighth Amendment\'s Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause. *Id*., at 51, ¶66. And they **\*2214** sought to
pursue their claim on behalf of a class encompassing "all involuntarily
homeless people living in Grants Pass." *Id.*, at 48,
¶52.[^2^](#X611beab9537fd77b8ec2bfc036c2341b606d3a8)

The district court certified the class action and enjoined the city from
enforcing its public-camping laws against the homeless. . . . \[T\]he
court found, everyone without shelter in Grants Pass was "involuntarily
homeless" because the city\'s total homeless population outnumbered its
" 'practically available' " shelter beds. App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a,
216a. In fact, the court ruled, none of the beds at Grants Pass\'s
charity-run shelter qualified as "available." They did not, the court
said, both because that shelter offers something closer to transitional
housing than "temporary emergency shelter," and because the shelter has
rules requiring residents to abstain from smoking and attend religious
services. *Id*., at 179a--180a. The Eighth Amendment, the district court
thus concluded, prohibited Grants Pass from enforcing its laws against
homeless individuals in the city. *Id*., at 182a--183a.

A

The Constitution and its Amendments impose a number of limits on what
governments in this country may declare to be criminal behavior and how
they may go about enforcing their criminal laws. Familiarly, the First
Amendment prohibits governments from using their criminal laws to
abridge the rights to speak, worship, assemble, petition, and exercise
the freedom of the press. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment prevents governments from adopting laws that invidiously
discriminate between persons. The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments ensure that officials may not displace certain
rules associated with criminal liability that are "so old and
venerable," " 'so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our
people\[,\] as to be ranked as fundamental.' " [*Kahler v. Kansas*, 589
U.S. 271, 279, 140 S.Ct. 1021, 206 L.Ed.2d 312
(2020)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2050616471&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_279&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_279)
(quoting [*Leland v. Oregon*, 343 U.S. 790, 798, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed.
1302
(1952)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1952117928&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_798&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_798)).
The Fifth and Sixth Amendments require prosecutors and courts to observe
various procedures before denying any person of his liberty, promising
for example that every person enjoys the right to confront his accusers
and have serious criminal charges resolved by a jury of his peers. One
could go on.

But if many other constitutional provisions address what a government
may criminalize and how it may go about securing a conviction, the
Eighth Amendment\'s prohibition against "cruel and unusual punishments"
focuses on what happens next. That Clause "has always been considered,
and properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of punishment" a
government may "impos\[e\] for the violation of criminal statutes."
[*Powell v. Texas*, 392 U.S. 514, 531--532, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20 L.Ed.2d
1254
(1968)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_531&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_531)
(plurality opinion).

We have previously discussed the Clause\'s origins and meaning. In the
18th century, English law still "formally tolerated" certain barbaric
punishments like "disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and
burning alive," even though those practices had by then "fallen into
disuse." [*Bucklew v. Precythe*, 587 U.S. 119, 130, 139 S.Ct. 1112, 203
L.Ed.2d 521
(2019)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130)
(citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws **\*2216** of England
370 (1769) (Blackstone)). The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was
adopted to ensure that the new Nation would never resort to any of those
punishments or others like them. Punishments like those were "cruel"
because they were calculated to " 'superad\[d\]' " " 'terror, pain, or
disgrace.' " [587 U.S., at 130, 139 S.Ct. 1112 (quoting 4 Blackstone
370)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130).
And they were "unusual" because, by the time of the Amendment\'s
adoption, they had "long fallen out of use." [587 U.S., at 130, 139
S.Ct.
1112](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130).
. . .

All that would seem to make the Eighth Amendment a poor foundation on
which to rest the kind of decree the plaintiffs seek in this case and
the Ninth Circuit has endorsed since
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause focuses on the question what
"method or kind of punishment" a government may impose after a criminal
conviction, not on the question whether a government may criminalize
particular behavior in the first place or how it may go about securing a
conviction for that offense. [*Powell*, 392 U.S., at 531--532, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_531&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_531).
To the extent the Constitution speaks to those other matters, it does
so, as we have seen, in other provisions.

Nor, focusing on the criminal punishments Grant Pass imposes, can we say
they qualify as cruel and unusual. Recall that, under the city\'s
ordinances, an initial offense may trigger a civil fine. Repeat offenses
may trigger an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a
public park. Only those who later violate an order like that may face a
criminal punishment of up to 30 days in jail and a larger fine. See Part
I--C, *supra*. None of the city\'s sanctions qualifies as cruel because
none is designed to "superad\[d\]" "terror, pain, or disgrace."
[*Bucklew*, 587 U.S., at 130, 139 S.Ct.
1112](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047896453&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_130&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_130)

they insist one notable exception exists.

In [*Robinson v. California*, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758
(1962)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
the plaintiffs and the dissent observe, this Court addressed a challenge
to a criminal conviction under a California statute providing that "
'\[n\]o person shall \... be addicted to the use of narcotics.' "
[*Ibid*., n.
1](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
In response to that challenge, the Court invoked the Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause to hold that California could not enforce its law
making "the 'status' of narcotic addiction a criminal offense." [*Id*.,
at 666, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
The Court recognized that "imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the
abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual." [*Id*., at
667, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
But, the Court reasoned, when punishing " 'status,' " "\[e\]ven one day
in prison would be \... cruel and unusual." [*Id*., at 666--667, 82
S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

. . . \[T\]he Court read\[\] the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to
impose a limit not just on what punishments may follow a criminal
conviction but what a State may criminalize to begin with. It was a view
unprecedented in the history of the Court before 1962. In dissent,
Justice White lamented that the majority had embraced an "application of
'cruel and unusual punishment' so novel that" it could not possibly be
"ascribe\[d\] to the Framers of the Constitution." [370 U.S., at 689, 82

has this Court once invoked it as authority to decline the enforcement
of any criminal law, leaving the Eighth Amendment instead to perform its
traditional function of addressing the punishments that follow a
criminal conviction.

Rather than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions like

maintaining a temporary place to live." Grants Pass Municipal Code §§
5.61.030, 5.61.010; App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a--222a. Under the city\'s
laws, it makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless,
a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student who abandons
his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal
building. See Part I--C, *supra*; *Blake* v. *Grants Pass*, No.

jurisdictions across the country. See Part I--A, *supra*. And because

Yes, the statute required proof of an act (becoming drunk or intoxicated
and then proceeding into public), and perhaps some associated mental
state (for presumably the defendant knew he was drinking and maybe even
knew he made his way to a public place). Still, Mr. Powell contended,
Texas\'s law effectively criminalized his status as an alcoholic because
he could not help but doing as he did.

That small intrusion, Justice Marshall said, prevents States only from
enforcing laws that criminalize "a mere status." [*Id.*, at 532, 88

But how are city officials and law enforcement officers to know what it
means to be "involuntarily" homeless, or whether any particular person
meets that standard? **\*2222** Posing the questions may be easy;
answering them is not. Is it enough that a homeless person has turned
down an offer of shelter? Or does it matter why? Cities routinely
confront individuals who decline offers of shelter for any number of
reasons, ranging from safety concerns to individual preferences. See
Part I--A, *supra*. How are cities and their law enforcement officers on
the ground to know which of these reasons are sufficiently weighty to
qualify a person as "involuntarily" homeless?

If there are answers to those questions, they cannot be found in the
Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. . . . To be sure,
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
attempted to head off these complexities through some
back-of-the-envelope arithmetic. The Ninth Circuit said a city needs to
consider individuals "involuntarily" homeless (and thus entitled to camp
on public property) only when the overall homeless population exceeds
the total number of "adequate" and "practically available" shelter beds.
See [920 F.3d, at 617--618, and n.

But as sometimes happens with abstract rules created by those far from
the front lines, that test has proven all but impossible to administer
in practice.

Homelessness is complex. Its causes are many. So may be the public
policy responses required to address it. At bottom, the question this
case presents is whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges
primary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those
responses. It does not. Almost 200 years ago, a visitor to this country
remarked upon the "extreme skill with which the inhabitants of the
United States succeed in proposing a common object to the exertions of a
great many men, and in getting them voluntarily to pursue it." 2 A. de
Tocqueville, Democracy in America 129 (H. Reeve transl. 1961). If the
multitude of *amicus* briefs before us proves one thing, it is that the
American people are still at it. Through their voluntary associations
and charities, their elected representatives and appointed officials,
their police officers and mental health professionals, they display that
same energy and skill today in their efforts to address the complexities
of the homelessness challenge facing the most vulnerable among us.

Yes, people will disagree over which policy responses are best; they may
experiment with one set of approaches only to find later another set
works better; they may find certain responses more appropriate for some
communities than others. But in our democracy, that is their right. Nor
can a handful of federal judges begin to "match" the collective wisdom
the American people possess in deciding "how best to handle" a pressing
social question like homelessness. [*Robinson*, 370 U.S., at 689, 82

concurring.**

I join the Court\'s opinion in full because it correctly rejects the
respondents' claims under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. . .
. I write separately to make two additional observations about the
respondents' claims.

First, the precedent that the respondents primarily rely upon,
[*Robinson v. California*, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758
(1962)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
was wrongly decided. In
[*Robinson*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
the Court held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits
the enforcement of laws criminalizing a person\'s status. [*Id*., at
666, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
That holding conflicts with the plain text and history of the Cruel and
Unusual Punishments Clause. . . .

Second, the respondents have not established that their claims implicate
the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause in the first place. The
challenged ordinances are enforced through the imposition of civil fines
and civil park exclusion orders, as well as through criminal trespass
charges. But, "\[a\]t the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the
word 'punishment' referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of
a crime." [*Helling v. McKinney*, 509 U.S. 25, 38, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125
L.Ed.2d 22
(1993)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1993124663&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_38&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_38)
(THOMAS, J., dissenting); see *ante,* at 2215 -- 2216. The respondents
have yet to explain how the civil fines and park exclusion orders
constitute a "penalty imposed for the commission of a crime."
[*Helling*, 509 U.S., at 38, 113 S.Ct.

Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. For some people, sleeping
outside is their only option. The City of Grants Pass jails and fines
those people for sleeping anywhere in public at any time, including in
their cars, if they use as little as a blanket to keep warm or a
rolled-up shirt as a pillow. For people with no access to shelter, that
punishes them for being homeless. That is unconscionable and
unconstitutional. Punishing people for their status is "cruel and
unusual" under the Eighth Amendment. See [*Robinson v. California*, 370
U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758
(1962)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Homelessness is a reality for too many Americans. On any given night,
over half a million people across the country lack a fixed, regular, and
adequate nighttime residence. Many do not have access to shelters and
are left to sleep in cars, sidewalks, parks, and other public places.
They experience homelessness due to complex and interconnected issues,
including crippling debt and stagnant wages; domestic and sexual abuse;
physical and psychiatric disabilities; and rising housing costs coupled
with declining affordable housing options.

At the same time, States and cities face immense challenges in
responding to homelessness. To address these challenges and provide for
public health and safety, local governments need wide latitude,
including to regulate when, where, and how homeless people sleep in
public. The decision below did, in fact, leave cities free to punish
"littering, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways,
possession or distribution of illicit substances, harassment, or
violence." App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a. The only question for the Court
today is whether the Constitution permits punishing homeless people with
no access to shelter for sleeping in public with as little as a blanket
to keep warm.

It is possible to acknowledge and balance the issues facing local
governments, the humanity and dignity of homeless people, and our
constitutional principles. Instead, the majority focuses almost
exclusively on the needs of local governments and leaves the most
vulnerable in our society with an impossible choice: Either stay awake
or be arrested. The Constitution provides a baseline of rights for all
Americans rich and poor, housed and unhoused. This Court must safeguard
those rights even when, and perhaps especially when, doing so is
uncomfortable or unpopular. Otherwise, "the words of the Constitution
become little more than good advice." [*Trop v. Dulles*, 356 U.S. 86,
104, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630
(1958)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1958121425&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_104&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_104)
(plurality opinion).

The causes, consequences, and experiences of homelessness are complex
and **\*2229** interconnected. The majority paints a picture of "cities
across the American West" in "crisis" that are using criminalization as
a last resort. *Ante*, at 2207. That narrative then animates the
majority\'s reasoning. This account, however, fails to engage seriously
with the precipitating causes of homelessness, the damaging effects of
criminalization, and the myriad legitimate reasons people may lack or
decline shelter.

A

Over 600,000 people experience homelessness in America on any given
night, meaning that they lack "a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime
residence." Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, T. de Sousa et al.,
The 2023 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress 4 (2023 AHAR).
These people experience homelessness in different ways. Although 6 in 10
are able to secure shelter beds, the remaining 4 in 10 are unsheltered,
sleeping "in places not meant for human habitation," such as sidewalks,
abandoned buildings, bus or train stations, camping grounds, and parked
vehicles. See *id*., at 2. "Some sleep alone in public places, without
any physical structures (like tents or shacks) or connection to
services. Others stay in encampments, which generally refer to groups of
people living semipermanently in tents or other temporary structures in
a public space." Brief for California as *Amicus Curiae* 6 (California
Brief) (citation omitted). This is in part because there has been a
national "shortage of 188,000 shelter beds for individual adults." Brief
for Service Providers as *Amici Curiae* 8 (Service Providers Brief).

People become homeless for many reasons, including some beyond their
control. "\[S\]tagnant wages and the lack of affordable housing" can
mean some people are one unexpected medical bill away from being unable
to pay rent. Brief for Public Health Professionals and Organizations as
*Amici Curiae* 3. Every "\$100 increase in median rental price" is
"associated with about a 9 percent increase in the estimated
homelessness rate." GAO, A. Cackley, Homelessness: Better HUD Oversight
of Data Collection Could Improve Estimates of Homeless Populations 30
(GAO--20--433, 2020). Individuals with disabilities, immigrants, and
veterans face policies that increase housing instability. See California
Brief 7. Natural disasters also play a role, including in Oregon, where
increasing numbers of people "have lost housing because of climate
events such as extreme wildfires across the state, floods in the coastal
areas, \[and\] heavy snowstorms." 2023 AHAR 52. Further, "mental and
physical health challenges," and family and domestic "violence and
abuse" can be precipitating causes of homelessness. California Brief 7.

People experiencing homelessness are young and old, live in families and
as individuals, and belong to all races, cultures, and creeds. Given the
complex web of causes, it is unsurprising that the burdens of
homelessness fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable in our
society. People already in precarious positions with mental and physical
health, trauma, or abuse may have nowhere else to go if forced to leave
their homes. Veterans, victims of domestic violence, teenagers, and
people with disabilities are all at an increased risk of homelessness.
For veterans, "those with a history of mental health conditions,
including [post-traumatic stress
disorder](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ia99c9de5475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)
(PTSD) \... are at greater risk of homelessness." Brief for American
Psychiatric Association et al. as *Amici Curiae* 6. For women, almost
60% of those experiencing homelessness report that fleeing domestic
violence was the "immediate cause." Brief for Advocates for Survivors of
Gender-Based Violence as *Amici Curiae* 9. For young people, "family
dysfunction and rejection, **\*2230** sexual abuse, juvenile legal
system involvement, 'aging out' of the foster care system, and economic
hardship" make them particularly vulnerable to homelessness. Brief for
Juvenile Law Center et al. as *Amici Curiae* 2. For American Indians,
"policies of removal and resettlement in tribal lands" have caused
displacement, resulting in "a disproportionately high rate of housing
insecurity and unsheltered homelessness." Brief for StrongHearts Native
Helpline et al. as *Amici Curiae* 10, 24. For people with disabilities,
"\[l\]ess than 5% of housing in the United States is accessible for
moderate mobility disabilities, and less than 1% is accessible for
wheelchair use." Brief for Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund
et al. as *Amici Curiae* 2 (Disability Rights Brief).

B

States and cities responding to the homelessness crisis face the
difficult task of addressing the underlying causes of homelessness while
also providing for public health and safety. This includes, for example,
dealing with the hazards posed by encampments, such as "a heightened
risk of disease associated with living outside without bathrooms or wash
basins," "deadly fires" from efforts to "prepare food and create heat
sources," violent crime, and drug distribution and abuse. California
Brief 12.

Local governments need flexibility in responding to homelessness with
effective and thoughtful solutions. See *infra*, at 2237 -- 2239. Almost
all of these policy solutions are beyond the scope of this case. The
only question here is whether the Constitution permits criminalizing
sleeping outside when there is nowhere else to go. That question is
increasingly relevant because many local governments have made
criminalization a frontline response to homelessness. "\[L\]ocal
measures to criminalize 'acts of living' " by "prohibit\[ing\] sleeping,
eating, sitting, or panhandling in public spaces" have recently
proliferated. U. S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, Searching Out
Solutions 1 (2012).

Criminalizing homelessness can cause a destabilizing cascade of harm.
"Rather than helping people to regain housing, obtain employment, or
access needed treatment and services, criminalization creates a costly
revolving door that circulates individuals experiencing homelessness
from the street to the criminal justice system and back." *Id*., at 6.
When a homeless person is arrested or separated from their property, for
example, "items frequently destroyed include personal documents needed
for accessing jobs, housing, and services such as IDs, driver\'s
licenses, financial documents, birth certificates, and benefits cards;
items required for work such as clothing and uniforms, bicycles, tools,
and computers; and irreplaceable mementos." Brief for 57 Social
Scientists as *Amici Curiae* 17--18 (Social Scientists Brief). Consider
Erin Spencer, a disabled Marine Corps veteran who stores items he uses
to make a living, such as tools and bike parts, in a cart. He was
arrested repeatedly for illegal lodging. Each time, his cart and
belongings were gone once he returned to the sidewalk. "\[T\]he massive
number of times the City or State has taken all I possess leaves me in a
vacuous déjà vu." Brief for National Coalition for Homeless Veterans et
al. as *Amici Curiae* 28.

Incarceration and warrants from unpaid fines can also result in the loss
of employment, benefits, and housing options. See Social Scientists
Brief 13, 17 (incarceration and warrants can lead to "termination of
federal health benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid,"
the "loss of a shelter bed," or disqualification from "public housing
and Section 8 vouchers"). Finally, **\*2231** criminalization can lead
homeless people to "avoid calling the police in the face of abuse or
theft for fear of eviction from public space." *Id*., at 27. Consider
the tragic story of a homeless woman "who was raped almost immediately
following a police move-along order that pushed her into an unfamiliar
area in the dead of night." *Id.,* at 26. She described her hesitation
in calling for help: "What\'s the point? If I called them, they would
have made all of us move \[again\]." *Ibid*.

For people with nowhere else to go, fines and jail time do not deter
behavior, reduce homelessness, or increase public safety. In one study,
91% of homeless people who were surveyed "reported remaining outdoors,
most often just moving two to three blocks away" when they received a
move-along order. *Id*., at 23. Police officers in these cities
recognize as much: " 'Look we\'re not really solving anybody\'s problem.
This is a big game of whack-a-mole.' " *Id*., at 24. Consider Jerry Lee,
a Grants Pass resident who sleeps in a van. Over the course of three
days, he was woken up and cited six times for "camping in the city
limits" just because he was sleeping in the van. App. 99 (capitalization
omitted). Lee left the van each time only to return later to sleep.
Police reports eventually noted that he "continues to disregard the city
ordinance and returns to the van to sleep as soon as police leave the
area. Dayshift needs to check on the van this morning and \... follow up
for tow." *Ibid*. (same).

Shelter beds that are available in theory may be practically unavailable
because of "restrictions based on gender, age, income, sexuality,
religious practice, curfews that conflict with employment obligations,
and time limits on stays." Social Scientists Brief 22. Studies have
shown, however, that the "vast majority of those who are unsheltered
would move inside if safe and affordable options were available."
Service Providers Brief 8 (collecting studies). Consider CarrieLynn
Hill. She cannot stay at Gospel Rescue Mission, the only entity in
Grants Pass offering temporary beds, because "she would have to check
her
[nebulizer](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=mdev&entityId=Ic14d11d7475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)
in as medical equipment and, though she must use it at least once every
four hours, would not be able to use it in her room." Disability Rights
Brief 18. Similarly, Debra Blake\'s "disabilities prevent her from
working, which means she cannot comply with the Gospel Rescue Mission\'s
requirement that its residents work 40-hour work weeks." *Ibid.*

Before I move on, consider one last example of a Nashville man who
experienced homelessness for nearly 20 years. When an outreach worker
tried to help him secure housing, the worker had difficulty finding him
for his appointments because he was frequently arrested for being
homeless. He was arrested 198 times and had over 250 charged citations,
all for petty offenses. The outreach worker made him a t-shirt that read
"Please do not arrest me, my outreach worker is working on my housing."
Service Providers Brief 16. Once the worker was able to secure him
stable housing, he "had no further encounters with the police, no
citations, and no arrests." *Ibid.*

These and countless other stories reflect the reality of criminalizing
sleeping outside when people have no other choice.

II

Grants Pass, a city of 38,000 people in southern Oregon, adopted three
ordinances (Ordinances) that effectively make it unlawful to sleep
anywhere in public, including in your car, at any time, with as little
as a blanket or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow. . . .

Respondents here, two longtime residents of Grants Pass who are homeless
and sleep in their cars, sued on behalf of themselves and all other
involuntarily homeless people in the City, seeking to enjoin enforcement
of the Ordinances. The District Court eventually certified a class and
granted summary judgment to respondents. "As was the case in
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
Grants Pass has far more homeless people than 'practically available'
shelter beds." App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a. The City had "zero emergency
shelter beds," and even counting the beds at the Gospel Rescue Mission
(GRM), which is "the only entity in Grants Pass that offers any sort of
temporary program for some class members," "GRM\'s 138 beds would not be
nearly enough to accommodate the at least 602 homeless individuals in
Grants Pass." *Id.*, at 179a--180a. Thus, "the only way for homeless
people to legally sleep on public property within the City is if they
lay on the ground with only the clothing on their backs and without
their items near them." *Id*., at 178a.

The District Court entered a narrow injunction. It concluded that Grants
Pass could "implement time and place restrictions for when homeless
individuals may use their belongings to keep warm and dry and when they
must have their belonging\[s\] packed up." *Id*., at 199a. The City
could also "ban the use of tents in public parks," as long as it did not
"ban people from using any bedding type materials to keep warm and dry
while they sleep." *Id*., **\*2233** at 199a--200a. Further, Grants Pass
could continue to "enforce laws that actually further public health and
safety, such as laws restricting littering, public urination or
defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or distribution of
illicit substances, harassment, or violence." *Id.,* at 200a. . . .

III

The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of "cruel and unusual
punishments." Amdt. 8 (Punishments Clause). . . .

In [*Robinson* v.
*California*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
this Court detailed one substantive limitation on criminal punishment.
Lawrence Robinson was convicted under a California statute for "
'be\[ing\] addicted to the use of narcotics' " and faced a mandatory
90-day jail sentence. [370 U.S., at 660, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_660&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_660).
The California statute did not "punis\[h\] a person for the use of
narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial or
disorderly behavior resulting from their administration." [*Id*., at
666, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Instead, it made "the 'status' of narcotic addiction a criminal offense,
for which the offender may be prosecuted 'at any time before he
reforms.' "
[*Ibid*.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))

The Court held that, because it criminalized the " 'status' of narcotic
addiction,"
[*ibid.*,](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
the California law "inflict\[ed\] a cruel and unusual punishment in
violation" of the Punishments Clause, [*id*., at 667, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Importantly, the Court did not limit that holding to the status of
narcotic addiction alone. It began by reasoning that the criminalization
of the "mentally ill, or a leper, or \[those\] afflicted with a
[venereal
disease](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ic8edbc8c475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)"
"would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and
unusual punishment." [*Id*., at 666, 82 S.Ct.
1417](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
It extended that same reasoning to the status of being an addict,

Grants Pass\'s Ordinances criminalize being homeless. The status of
being homeless (lacking available shelter) is defined by the very
behavior singled out for punishment (sleeping outside). The majority
protests that the Ordinances "do not criminalize mere status." *Ante,*
at 2218. Saying so does not make it so. Every shred of evidence points
the other way. The Ordinances' purpose, text, and enforcement confirm
that they target status, not conduct. For someone with no available
shelter, the only way to comply with the Ordinances is to leave Grants
Pass altogether.

A

Start with their purpose. The Ordinances, as enforced, are intended to
criminalize being homeless. The Grants Pass City Council held a public
meeting in 2013 to " 'identify solutions to current vagrancy problems.'
" App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a. The council discussed the City\'s
previous efforts to banish homeless people by "buying the person a bus
ticket to a specific destination," or transporting them to a different
jurisdiction and "leaving them there." App. 113--114. That was
unsuccessful, so the council discussed other ideas, **\*2235** including
a " 'do not serve' " list or "a 'most unwanted list' made by taking
pictures of the offenders \... and then disseminating it to all the
service agencies." *Id*., at 121. The council even contemplated denying
basic services such as "food, clothing, bedding, hygiene, and those
types of things." *Ibid*.

The idea was deterrence, not altruism. "\[U\]ntil the pain of staying
the same outweighs the pain of changing, people will not change; and
some people need an external source to motivate that needed change."
*Id*., at 119. One councilmember opined that "\[m\]aybe they aren\'t
hungry enough or cold enough \... to make a change in their behavior."
*Id*., at 122. The council president summed up the goal succinctly: "
'\[T\]he point is to make it uncomfortable enough for \[homeless
people\] in our city so they will want to move on down the road.' "
*Id*., at 114. . . .

B

Next consider the text. The Ordinances by their terms single out
homeless people. They define "campsite" as "any place where bedding,
sleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes" is placed
"for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live." § 5.61.010.
The majority claims that it "makes no difference whether the charged
defendant is homeless." *Ante,* at 2218. Yet the Ordinances do not apply
unless bedding is placed to maintain a temporary place to live. Thus,
"what separates prohibited conduct from permissible conduct is a
person\'s intent to 'live' in public spaces. Infants napping in
strollers, Sunday afternoon picnickers, and nighttime stargazers may all
engage in the same conduct of bringing blankets to public spaces \[and
sleeping\], but they are exempt from punishment because they have a
separate 'place to live' to which they presumably intend to return."
Brief for Criminal Law and Punishment Scholars as *Amici Curiae* 12.

Put another way, the Ordinances single out for punishment the activities
that define the status of being homeless. By most definitions, homeless
individuals are those that lack "a fixed, regular, and adequate
nighttime residence." [42 U.S.C. §
11434a(2)(A)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=42USCAS11434A&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_64eb0000ab9e4);
[24 C.F.R. §§
582.5](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000547&cite=24CFRS582.5&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
[578.3
(2023)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000547&cite=24CFRS578.3&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Permitting Grants Pass to criminalize sleeping outside with as little as
a blanket permits Grants Pass to criminalize homelessness. . . . 

Take the respondents here, two longtime homeless residents of Grants
Pass who sleep in their cars. The Ordinances define "campsite" to
include "any vehicle." § 5.61.010(B). For respondents, the Ordinances as
applied do not criminalize any behavior or conduct related to
encampments (such as fires or tents). Instead, the Ordinances target
respondents' status as people without any other form of shelter. Under
the majority\'s logic, cities cannot criminalize the status of being
homeless, but they can criminalize the conduct that defines that status.
The Constitution cannot be evaded by such formalistic distinctions.

The Ordinances' definition of "campsite" creates a situation where
homeless people necessarily break the law just by existing.  . . .
 Every human needs to sleep at some point. Even if homeless people with
no available shelter options can exist for a few days in Grants Pass
without sleeping, they eventually must leave or be criminally punished.

The majority resists this understanding, arguing that the Ordinances
criminalize the conduct of being homeless in Grants Pass while sleeping
with as little as a blanket. Therefore, the argument goes, "\[r\]ather
than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions." *. . . *The
best the majority can muster is the following tautology: The Ordinances
criminalize conduct, not pure status, because they apply to conduct, not
status.

The flaw in this conclusion is evident. The majority countenances the
criminalization of status as long as the City tacks on an essential
bodily function---blinking, sleeping, eating, or breathing. That is just
another way to ban the person. By this logic, the majority would
conclude that the ordinance deemed unconstitutional in
[*Robinson*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
criminalizing "being an addict" would be constitutional if it
criminalized "being an addict and breathing."  . . . 

The Ordinances are enforced exactly as intended: to criminalize the
status of being **\*2237** homeless. City officials sought to use the
Ordinances to drive homeless people out of town. See *supra*, at 2234 --
2235. The message to homeless residents is clear. As Debra Blake, a
named plaintiff who passed away while this case was pending, see n. 1,
*supra*, shared:

"I have been repeatedly told by Grants Pass police that I must 'move
along' and that there is nowhere in Grants Pass that I can legally sit
or rest. I have been repeatedly awakened by Grants Pass police while
sleeping and told that I need to get up and move. I have been told by
Grants Pass police that I should leave town.

Because I have no choice but to live outside and have no place else to
go, I have gotten tickets, fines and have been criminally prosecuted for
being homeless." App. 180--181.

Debra Blake\'s heartbreaking message captures the cruelty of
criminalizing someone for their status: "I am afraid at all times in
Grants Pass that I could be arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for
sleeping outside or for covering myself with a blanket to stay warm."
*Id*., at 182. So, at times, when she could, Blake "slept outside of the
city." *Ibid.* Blake, who was disabled, unemployed, and elderly,
"owe\[d\] the City of Grants Pass more than \$5000 in fines for crimes
and violations related directly to \[her\] involuntary homelessness and
the fact that there is no affordable housing or emergency shelters in
Grants Pass where \[she could\] stay." *Ibid*.

. . . 

The majority proclaims, with no citation, that "it makes no difference
whether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation
passing through town, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp
out in protest." *Ante,* at 2218. That describes a fantasy. In reality,
the deputy chief of police operations acknowledged that he was not aware
of "any non-homeless person ever getting a ticket for illegal camping in
Grants Pass."  . . .

The majority . . . spars with a strawman in its discussion of [*Powell*

covered any "condition \[the defendant\] is powerless to change," [392
U.S., at 567, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_780_567&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_780_567)
(Fortas, J., dissenting), and four Justices rejected that view. Justice
White, casting the decisive fifth vote, left the question open because
the defendant had "made no showing that he was unable to stay off the
streets on the night in question." [*Id*., at 554, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
(opinion concurring in judgment). So, in his view, it was "unnecessary
to pursue at this point the further definition of the circumstances or
the state of intoxication which might bar conviction of a chronic
alcoholic for being drunk in a public place." [*Id*., at 553, 88 S.Ct.
2145](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

This case similarly called for a straightforward application of

Court considered a statute that criminalized voluntary conduct (getting
drunk) that could be rendered involuntary by a status (alcoholism);
here, the Ordinances criminalize conduct (sleeping outside) that defines
a particular status (homelessness). So unlike the debate in
[*Powell*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1968131237&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
this case does not turn on whether the criminalized actions are "
'involuntary' or 'occasioned by' " a particular status. [*Id*., at 533,
88 S.Ct.

(Marshall, J., dissenting). For all the reasons discussed above, see
*supra,* at 2234 -- 2238, these Ordinances criminalize status and are
thus unconstitutional under any of the opinions in

. . . The majority cites various *amicus* briefs to amplify Grants
Pass\'s belief that its homelessness crisis is intractable absent the
ability to criminalize homelessness. In so doing, the majority chooses
to see only **\*2241** what it wants. Many of those stakeholders support
the narrow rule in
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

in a public space should not be a crime leading to an arrest, criminal
conviction, or jail"); California Brief 2--3 ("\[T\]he Constitution does
not allow the government to punish people for the status of being
homeless. Nor should it allow the government to effectively punish the
status of being homeless by making it a crime in all events for someone
with no other options to sleep outside on public property at night").

Even the Federal Government, which restricts some sleeping activities on
park lands, see *ante,* at 2210 -- 2211, has for nearly three decades
"taken the position that laws prohibiting sleeping in public at all
times and in all places violate the
[*Robinson*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1962127658&pubNum=0000780&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
principle as applied to individuals who have no access to shelter."
Brief for United States as *Amicus Curiae* 14. The same is true of
States across the Nation. See Brief for Maryland et al. as *Amici
Curiae* 3--4 ("Taking these policies \[criminalizing homelessness\] off
the table does not interfere with our ability to address homelessness
(including the effects of homelessness on surrounding communities) using
other policy tools, nor does it amount to an undue intrusion on state
sovereignty").

Nothing in today\'s decision prevents these States, cities, and counties
from declining to criminalize people for sleeping in public when they
have no available shelter. Indeed, although the majority describes
[*Martin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2047897919&pubNum=0000506&originatingDoc=Ib9688b16354011efb5b5e02d7c311e0c&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
as adopting an unworkable rule, the elected representatives in Oregon
codified that very rule. See *infra*, at 2241 -- 2242. The majority does
these localities a disservice by ascribing to them a demand for
unfettered freedom to punish that many do not seek.

VI

The Court wrongly concludes that the Eighth Amendment permits Ordinances
that effectively criminalize being homeless. Grants Pass\'s Ordinances
may still raise a host of other legal issues. Perhaps recognizing the
untenable position it adopts, the majority stresses that "many
substantive legal protections and provisions of the Constitution may
have important roles to play when States and cities seek to enforce
their laws against the homeless." *Ante,* at 2224. That is true.
Although I do not prejudge the merits of these other issues, I detail
some here so that people experiencing homelessness and their advocates
do not take the Court\'s decision today as closing the door on such
claims.

\* \* \* . . 

I remain hopeful that our society will come together "to address the
complexities of the homelessness challenge facing the most vulnerable
among us." *Ante,* at 2226. That responsibility is shared by those
vulnerable populations, the States and cities in which they reside, and
each and every one of us. "It is only after we begin to see a street as
*our* street, a public park as *our* park, a school as *our* school,
that we can become engaged citizens, dedicating our time and resources
for worthwhile causes." M. Desmond, Evicted: Property and Profit in the
American City 294 (2016).

This Court, too, has a role to play in faithfully enforcing the
Constitution to prohibit punishing the very existence of those without
shelter. I remain hopeful that someday in the near future, this Court
will play its role in safeguarding constitutional liberties for the most
vulnerable among us. Because the Court today abdicates that role, I
respectfully dissent.

delivered the opinion of the Court.**

 

Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into
a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not
omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and
existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant
presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an
autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression,
and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the
person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions.

I

The question before the Court is the validity of a Texas statute making
it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate
sexual conduct.

 

In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were
dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons
disturbance. They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners,
John Geddes Lawrence, resided. The right of the police to enter does not
seem to have been questioned. The officers observed Lawrence and another
man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act. The two petitioners were
arrested, held in custody overnight, and charged and convicted before a
Justice of the Peace.

 

The complaints described their crime as "deviate sexual intercourse,
namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man)." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 127a, 139a. The applicable state law is [Tex. Penal Code Ann. §
21.06(a)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000182&cite=TXPES21.06&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_8b3b0000958a4)
(2003). It provides: "A person commits an offense if he engages in
deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex." The
statute defines "\[d\]eviate sexual intercourse" as follows:

"(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the
mouth or anus of another person; or

"(B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with
an object." § 21.01(1).

 

The petitioners exercised their right to a trial *de novo* in Harris
County Criminal Court. They challenged the statute as a violation of the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and of a like
provision of the Texas Constitution. [Tex. Const., Art. 1, §
3a](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000171&cite=TXCNART1S3A&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
Those contentions were rejected. The petitioners, having entered a plea
of *nolo contendere,* were each fined \$200 and assessed court costs of
\$141.25. App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a--110a.

 

The Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District considered the
petitioners' federal constitutional arguments under both the Equal
Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. After
hearing the case en banc the court, in a divided opinion, rejected the
constitutional arguments and affirmed the convictions. [41 S.W.3d 349
(2001)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2001227541&pubNum=0004644&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
The majority opinion indicates that the Court of Appeals considered our
decision in [*Bowers v. Hardwick,* 478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92
L.Ed.2d 140
(1986)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1986133440&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
to be controlling on the federal due process aspect of the case.
*Bowers* then being authoritative, this was proper.

 

We granted certiorari, [537 U.S. 1044, 123 S.Ct. 661, 154 L.Ed.2d 514
(2002)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2002458002&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
to consider three questions:

1.  Whether petitioners' criminal convictions under the Texas
    'Homosexual Conduct' law---which criminalizes sexual intimacy by
    same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex
    couples---violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal
    protection of the laws.

2.  Whether petitioners' criminal convictions for adult consensual
    sexual intimacy in the home violate their vital interests in liberty
    and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
    Amendment.

3.  Whether *Bowers v. Hardwick, supra,* should be overruled. See Pet.
    for Cert. i.

 

The petitioners were adults at the time of the alleged offense. Their
conduct was in private and consensual.

II

We conclude the case should be resolved by determining whether the
petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the
exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution. For this inquiry we deem it necessary to
reconsider the Court's holding in *Bowers.*

 

\[The Court then described a series of cases that lead up to *Bowers*.\]
In *Griswold* \[in 1965\] the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting
the use of drugs or devices of contraception and counseling or aiding
and abetting the use of contraceptives. The Court described the
protected interest as a right to privacy and placed emphasis on the
marriage relation and the protected space of the marital bedroom.
[*Id.,* at 485, 85 S.Ct.
1678.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1965125098&pubNum=708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))

 

\[Another relevant precedent is\] [*Roe v. Wade,* 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct.
705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147
(1973)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1973126316&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
As is well known, the case involved a challenge to the Texas law
prohibiting abortions, but the laws of other States were affected as
well. Although the Court held the woman's rights were not absolute, her
right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as
an exercise of her liberty under the Due Process Clause. The Court cited
cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go well beyond it.
*Roe* recognized the right of a woman to make certain fundamental
decisions affecting her destiny and confirmed once more that the
protection of liberty under the Due Process Clause has a substantive
dimension of fundamental significance in defining the rights of the
person.

 

In [*Carey v. Population Services Int'l,* 431 U.S. 678, 97 S.Ct. 2010,
52 L.Ed.2d 675
(1977)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1977118797&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of
contraceptive devices to persons under 16 years of age. . . . This was
the state of the law with respect to some of the most relevant cases
when the Court considered *Bowers v. Hardwick.*

 

The facts in *Bowers* had some similarities to the instant case. A
police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question,
observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual
conduct with another adult male. The conduct was in violation of a
Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy. One
difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited
the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while
the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the
same sex. Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in
federal court to declare the state statute invalid. He alleged he was a
practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights
guaranteed to him by the Constitution. The Court, in an opinion by
Justice White, sustained the Georgia law. . . . Four Justices dissented.
. . .

 

The Court began its substantive discussion in *Bowers* as follows: "The
issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a
fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence
invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct
illegal and have done so for a very long time." [*Id.,* at 190, 106
S.Ct.
2841.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1986133440&pubNum=708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Court's own failure to
appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake. To say that the issue in
*Bowers* was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct
demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a
married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to
have sexual intercourse. The laws involved in *Bowers* and here are, to
be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular
sexual act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching
consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual
behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. The statutes do
seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to
formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to
choose without being punished as criminals.

 

This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State,
or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its
boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law
protects. It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to
enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their
own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. When
sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another
person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is
more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows
homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

 

Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and
thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to
engage in consensual sodomy, the *Bowers* Court said: "Proscriptions
against that conduct have ancient roots." [*Id.,* at 192, 106 S.Ct.
2841.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1986133440&pubNum=708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
In academic writings, and in many of the scholarly *amicus* briefs filed
to assist the Court in this case, there are fundamental criticisms of
the historical premises relied upon by the majority and concurring
opinions in *Bowers.* . . .  We need not enter this debate in the
attempt to reach a definitive historical judgment . . . \[the Court then
discussed the history of the criminalization of sex and sodomy\].

  

. . . . It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in *Bowers*
was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful
voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has
been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable
behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these
are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as
ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus
determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer
the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may
use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society
through operation of the criminal law. "Our obligation is to define the
liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code." [*Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,* 505 U.S. 833, 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120
L.Ed.2d 674
(1992)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1992116314&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

 

. . . In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past
half century are of most relevance here. These references show an
emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult
persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters
pertaining to sex. . . .

 

This emerging recognition should have been apparent when *Bowers* was
decided. In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal
Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for "criminal
penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private." ALI,
[Model Penal Code §
213.2](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS213.2&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
Comment 2, p. 372 (1980). It justified its decision on three grounds:
(1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing
conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private
conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily
enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail. ALI, Model Penal
Code, Commentary 277--280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955). In 1961 Illinois
changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code. Other States soon
followed. Brief for Cato Institute as *Amicus Curiae* 15--16.

 

In *Bowers* the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50
States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Court's decision
24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. [478 U.S., at
192--193, 106 S.Ct.
2841.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1986133440&pubNum=708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being
ignored, however. Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its
law for decades. . . .

 

In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in *Bowers* became
even more apparent in the years following its announcement. The 25
States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the
*Bowers* decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws
only against homosexual conduct. In those States where sodomy is still
proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a
pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in
private. The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had
not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances. [*State v. Morales,*
869 S.W.2d 941,
943](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1994026266&pubNum=0000713&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_713_943&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_713_943).

 

. . . Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect
for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked
in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both
interests. If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does
so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might
remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection
reasons. When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the
State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject
homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the
private spheres. The central holding of *Bowers* has been brought in
question by this case, and it should be addressed. Its continuance as
precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.

 

The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial. The
offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in
the Texas legal system. Still, it remains a criminal offense with all
that imports for the dignity of the persons charged. The petitioners
will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.
Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring
the registration of sex offenders.  . . .We are advised that if Texas
convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the
statute here in question the convicted person would come within the
registration laws of at least four States were he or she to be subject
to their jurisdiction. This underscores the consequential nature of the
punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the
criminal prohibition. Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries
with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction,
such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.

 

The foundations of *Bowers* have sustained serious erosion from our
recent decisions in *Casey* and *Romer.* . . . To the extent *Bowers*
relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted
that the reasoning and holding in *Bowers* have been rejected elsewhere.
The European Court of Human Rights has followed not *Bowers* but its own
decision in *Dudgeon v. United Kingdom.* . . .Other nations, too, have
taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of
homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct. . . . The
right the petitioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral
part of human freedom in many other countries. There has been no showing
that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing
personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent.

 

The doctrine of *stare decisis* is essential to the respect accorded to
the judgments of the Court and to the stability of the law. It is not,
however, an inexorable command. . . .

 The rationale of *Bowers* does not withstand careful analysis. . . .
 As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its
principles in their own search for greater freedom.

 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion. *It is so ordered.*

manipulative in invoking the doctrine. Today's opinions in support of
reversal do not bother to distinguish---or indeed, even bother to
mention---the paean to *stare decisis* coauthored by three Members of
today's majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey.* There, when *stare
decisis* meant preservation of judicially invented abortion rights, the
widespread criticism of *Roe* was strong reason to *reaffirm* it:

"Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a

21.06(a)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000182&cite=TXPES21.06&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_8b3b0000958a4)
(2003) undoubtedly imposes constraints on liberty. So do laws
prohibiting prostitution, recreational use of heroin, and, for that
matter, working more than 60 hours per week in a bakery. But there is no
right to "liberty" under the Due Process Clause, though today's opinion
repeatedly makes that claim. *. . .* The Fourteenth Amendment *expressly
allows* States to deprive their citizens of "liberty," *so long as "due
process of law" is provided. . . .*

 

 

. . . I turn now to the ground on which the Court squarely rests its
holding: the contention that there is no rational basis for the law here
under attack. This proposition is so out of accord with our
jurisprudence---indeed, with the jurisprudence of *any* society we
know---that it requires little discussion.

 

The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the belief of its citizens
that certain forms of sexual behavior are "immoral and unacceptable,"
[*Bowers, supra,* at 196, 106 S.Ct.
2841](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1986133440&pubNum=708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))---the
same interest furthered by criminal laws against fornication, bigamy,
adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity. *Bowers* held that
this *was* a legitimate state interest. The Court today reaches the
opposite conclusion. The Texas statute, it says, "furthers *no
legitimate state interest* which can justify its intrusion into the
personal and private life of the individual," *ante,* at 2484 (emphasis
added). The Court embraces instead Justice STEVENS' declaration in his
*Bowers* dissent, that " 'the fact that the governing majority in a
State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a
sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice,' "
*ante,* at 2483. This effectively decrees the end of all morals
legislation. If, as the Court asserts, the promotion of majoritarian
sexual morality is not even a *legitimate* state interest, none of the
above-mentioned laws can survive rational-basis review.

\* \* \*

Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a
law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called
homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some
homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that
has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier
opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which
any reputable law school *must* seek to belong) excludes from membership
any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law
firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective
partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct. See [*Romer,
supra,* at 653, 116 S.Ct.
1620.](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1996118409&pubNum=708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))

 

One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's
grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is "an
invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the
public and in the private spheres." *Ante,* at 2482. It is clear from
this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from
its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of
engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly
engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as
scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's
schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting
themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be
immoral and destructive. The Court views it as "discrimination" which it
is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with
the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly
unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously
"mainstream"; that in most States what the Court calls "discrimination"
against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that
proposals to ban such "discrimination" under Title VII have repeatedly
been rejected by Congress, see Employment Non--Discrimination Act of
1994, S. 2238, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994); Civil Rights Amendments,
H.R. 5452, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975); that in some cases such
"discrimination" is *mandated* by federal statute, see [10 U.S.C. §
654(b)(1)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=10USCAS654&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
(mandating discharge from the Armed Forces of any service member who
engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some
cases such "discrimination" is a constitutional right, see [*Boy Scouts
of America v. Dale,* 530 U.S. 640, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554
(2000)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2000388910&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=I64f913259c9711d9bc61beebb95be672&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

 

Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other
group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social
perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every
group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of
such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in
that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few
remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts.
But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's
views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would
no more *require* a State to criminalize homosexual acts---or, for that
matter, display *any* moral disapprobation of them---than I would
*forbid* it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the
range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be
stayed through the invention of a brand-new "constitutional right" by a
Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that
"later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper
in fact serve only to oppress," *ante,* at 2484; and when that happens,
later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our
system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not
imposed by a governing caste that knows best.

 

One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people
rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not
carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their
disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow
homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private
homosexual acts---and may legislate accordingly. The Court today
pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need
not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently
occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has
chosen not to appeal). . . . . Do not believe it. . . . Today's opinion
dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a
distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions,
insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. . . This case
"does not involve" the issue of homosexual marriage only if one
entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with
the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court
comfortingly assures us, this is so.

 

The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three:
Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a "fundamental right"
(which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational
relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest,
nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.

I join Justice SCALIA's dissenting opinion. I write separately to note

(Stewart, J., dissenting). If I were a member of the Texas Legislature,
I would vote to repeal it. Punishing someone for expressing his sexual
preference through noncommercial consensual conduct with another adult
does not appear to be a worthy way to expend valuable law enforcement
resources.

not empowered to help petitioners and others similarly situated. My

Dale Carpenter & Dahlia Lithwick on Lawrence

 

*Extreme Makeover*

***By [Dahlia
Lithwick](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/dahlia-lithwick)***

*March 4, 2012*

*from the New Yorker, March 12, 2012*

 

Tyron Garner and John Lawrence had a secret to keep: they weren't guilty
as charged.

In 2003, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Lawrence v.
Texas, ruling, by a six-to-three margin, that anti-sodomy laws were
unconstitutional. Even those of us who followed the case had a rather
gauzy notion of what had triggered the litigation. On the night of
September 17, 1998, someone made a phone call to the police, warning
that a black man was "going crazy with a gun" in an apartment just
outside Houston. A clutch of sheriff's deputies stormed the apartment,
and found no gun, but they arrested John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron
Garner for having sex in Lawrence's bedroom. And, in an unlikely series
of legal twists, the arrests of Lawrence and Garner became a vehicle for
challenging old anti-sodomy laws that were used solely to shame and
stigmatize gay couples. Lawrence and Garner were arrested for simply
doing what loving couples do.

The story told in Lawrence v. Texas was a story of sexual privacy,
personal dignity, intimate relationships, and shifting notions of family
in America. By the time the tale poured from Justice Anthony Kennedy's
pen, in his decisive majority opinion, it was even about the physical
dimension of love: "When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate
conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a
personal bond that is more enduring." The opinion used the word
"relationship" eleven times.

That is the story that Dale Carpenter, a professor at the University of
Minnesota Law School, seeks to untell in his important new book,
"Flagrant Conduct" (Norton), a chronicle that peels the Lawrence case
back through layers of carefully choreographed litigation and tactical
appeals, back to the human protagonists we never really got to know, and
back again through centuries of laws criminalizing "unnatural" sexual
activity. What if, Carpenter asks, this weren't a story about love, or
even sex? What if, in the end, Lawrence v. Texas was less a whodunnit
than a who didn't? And, if there was no sex, let alone an intimate
relationship, in John Lawrence's apartment that night, how did the case
come to be about both?

Start with the two men charged with sodomy. When Lawrence, who was born
in 1943 to devout white Southern Baptists, was enlisting in the Navy, he
quizzed a buddy about the forms he was filling out. "What's a
homosexual?" he wondered. Neither knew the word. Both were gay. After
leaving the Navy, Lawrence moved to Houston, worked as a medical
technician, and totted up a slew of drunk-driving violations, including
a conviction for murder by automobile, in 1967. In the late seventies,
he moved into a run-down complex in East Houston populated by
underemployed youngsters and strippers who liked to party. Lawrence
largely kept his sexual orientation a secret at work, and was anything
but a gay-rights activist. Right to the end of the litigation bearing
his name, Lawrence's principal beef was that overzealous policemen had
invaded his home without a warrant.

Tyron Garner, the tenth child of black Baptist parents, was twenty-four
years younger than Lawrence. He had no car and no fixed address, and
supported himself by washing dishes and cleaning houses when he could.
Described as "sweet" (despite three previous assault charges) and
effeminate, Garner was involved in a stormy relationship with another
white man from Houston, Robert Eubanks. And Eubanks, by all accounts,
was a mess. Homeless and a heavy drinker, he was the person who called
the police on September 17, 1998. Garner and Eubanks lived together
wherever they could find an apartment, fighting viciously along the way.
Garner and Lawrence, according to Carpenter's research, were never much
more than acquaintances. They weren't lovers before the case or after.

That night in 1998, Lawrence, Garner, Eubanks, and probably a fourth man
were all in Lawrence's apartment. Lawrence and Eubanks were very drunk.
Eubanks seems to have thought that Garner was being flirtatious with
Lawrence, and fell into a jealous rage. He left the apartment,
supposedly to get some soda, and called the police with a false story
about his lover, Garner, brandishing a gun. There was never any dispute
that the four policemen who responded to that call were entitled to
enter the apartment to investigate, or that Lawrence began screaming
furiously at the intruding officers, demanding to see a warrant and
threatening to call his lawyer. There was sexually explicit art on the
walls, notably a pencil drawing of a naked James Dean with oversized
genitals. Eventually, Lawrence and Garner were charged with the crime of
"deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same
sex (man)."

Some gay-rights attorneys, having been burned a dozen years earlier
when, in Bowers v. Hardwick, the Supreme Court upheld Georgia's
homosexual-sodomy law, wanted nothing to do with Lawrence or Garner or
the prospect of another legal challenge. Since the days of Brown v.
Board of Education, and right up to District of Columbia v. Heller, the
2008 handgun-ban case, major test cases, they knew, have turned as much
on selecting the perfect plaintiffs as on the law being challenged. An
interracial, lower-middle-to-lower-class pair hooking up in a seedy
apartment in a marginal neighborhood: Lawrence and Garner were hardly a
civil-rights litigator's dream plaintiffs. They were not the type to tug
at judicial heartstrings.

But advocates for gay rights couldn't afford to shop around for a
perfect plaintiff. They knew how hard it would be to find a case to
challenge the Texas sodomy statute. Since Bowers, no other test case had
emerged in which someone was actually arrested for violating a state
sodomy law. National gay-rights groups had been challenging state sodomy
laws based on supposed harms to gay citizens, who were, litigators
claimed, made to look like presumptive criminals. That strategy wasn't
working. After the Supreme Court, in Romer v. Evans (1996), struck down
a Colorado initiative excluding gays from anti-discrimination
protection, the time felt ripe for another challenge to sodomy statutes.
But the gay-civil-rights groups needed to find plaintiffs who would not
suffer custody losses or other collateral harms from admitting that they
had violated criminal sodomy laws, which tended to rule out gay couples
in a committed family relationship. As Carpenter puts it, civil-rights
attorneys knew that they needed plaintiffs "with little to lose." Garner
and Lawrence fit that bill.

The two were accidental plaintiffs in more ways than one. Instructively,
it was mere happenstance that their arrest even came to the attention of
civil-rights advocates in the first place. A closeted gay file clerk saw
the arrest report (the charge of sodomy was so rare that it didn't even
have an assigned code) and, gossiping at a local gay watering hole, told
the bartender, a man named Lane Lewis. Since Lewis happened to be a gay
activist, he recognized the potential importance of the case. It was
Lewis who called Lawrence and persuaded him to speak to a
gay-civil-rights veteran he had alerted. Each of the legal experts who
were subsequently brought into the case knew instantly that it could end
up at the high court. The challenge would be in finding a story about
love and personal dignity to tell about Lawrence and Garner.

The cultural trends, the legal strategists knew, were in their favor, as
they continue to be. Two decades ago, a majority of Americans thought
that gay sex should be illegal, and that gays should be barred from
serving openly in the military. Today, popular sentiment has switched
sides. The restriction on military service has been repealed, and almost
half the states have laws offering gays some protection from
discrimination. Whereas only a decade ago public-opinion polls showed
Americans opposing gay marriage by a two-to-one margin, new polls show
that slightly more than half of Americans are in favor of it. . . .

Lawrence and Garner may have been reluctant to talk to civil-rights
lawyers from the outset, and reluctant to become the face of gay sodomy
in Texas, and yet this imperfect test case could be made over into
something more than serviceable. Lambda Legal, a national gay-rights
advocacy group, agreed to represent them as a means both of directly
challenging Bowers v. Hardwick and of highlighting the consequences of
criminalizing consensual gay sex. Sodomy laws were almost never
enforced, but their very existence legitimatized a culture of
homophobia, and as long as Bowers was still on the books gay-rights
arguments would be stymied in the courts.

The legal opportunity depended, however, upon persuading the defendants
to go along with an unusual strategy. High-powered lawyers would
represent Lawrence and Garner, as long as they agreed to stop saying
they weren't guilty and instead entered a "no contest" plea. By doing
so, the two were promised relative personal privacy, and given a chance
to become a part of gay-civil-rights history. The cause was greater than
the facts themselves. Lawrence and Garner understood that they were
being asked to keep the dirty secret that there was no dirty secret.

That's the punch line: the case that affirmed the right of gay couples
to have consensual sex in private spaces seems to have involved two men
who were neither a couple nor having sex. In order to appeal to the
conservative Justices on the high court, the story of a booze-soaked
quarrel was repackaged as a love story. Nobody had to know that the
gay-rights case of the century was actually about three or four men
getting drunk in front of a television in a Harris County apartment
decorated with bad James Dean erotica.

The malleability of anti-gay laws is in part a function of failed legal
language. "Sodomy" was, for centuries, a crime defined by its
unspeakable nature. The eighteenth-century British legal commentator
William Blackstone called it a crime "not fit to be named," which takes
you only so far when it comes to drafting a ban. Sodomy was codified
thereafter as a "crime against nature," without much clarity about what
unspoken horrors were not to be spoken of. Early American sodomy laws
targeted heterosexual as well as homosexual conduct. The vagueness of
the original crime tainted the subsequent laws, allowing for selective
enforcement, and permitting those laws to turn into statutes that, like
the one in Texas, criminalized just homosexual activity. By the time
Texas criminalized gay sex, in 1973, it was also legalizing consensual
heterosexual sodomy and bestiality.

That same unspoken horror of unnamed "unnatural" deviant conduct leads
to Carpenter's most fascinating revelation: the arresting officers in
the Lawrence case never agreed on what they saw that night, and, in
fact, reported seeing completely different conduct at the time. Two of
the four officers who entered the apartment reported seeing two men
having sex. Yet one officer reported seeing anal sex and the other
remembered seeing oral sex. The other two saw no sex at all. At least
three saw the homoerotic drawing.

Carpenter's painstaking interviews establish that Garner and Lawrence
not only weren't having sex but were clothed (Lawrence was in his
underwear, preparing for bed) and in separate rooms. This makes sense if
you consider the timeline that night (Eubanks was ostensibly just
slipping out to buy a soda) and the fact that there was yet another man
still in the apartment. But the defendants' accounts were never
disclosed to the media. Nor was the existence of Lawrence's longtime
boyfriend, Jose Garcia. Requests by lawyers that the privacy of the two
plaintiffs be respected meant that little attention was ever paid to
their personal lives. Lawrence and Garner, for their part, were given
strict instructions by the lawyers to shun the press. (Carpenter is
careful throughout to show that none of the civil-rights lawyers lied or
misrepresented the facts.) The litigation strategy, as the case made its
way up through the trial courts and appeals courts, was deliberately
framed to highlight the need to decriminalize homosexual conduct as a
means of recognizing and legitimatizing same-sex "relationships" and
"families." In short, the legal issue was not that free societies must
let drunken gay Texans have sex; it was that gay families around the
country, in the words of one of the lawyers in the case, "are
essentially just like everybody else."

City of Chicago v. Morales

 

527 U.S. 41 (1999)

 

JUSTICE STEVENS announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the
opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V, and an opinion
with respect to Parts III, IV, and VI, in which JUSTICE SOUTER and
JUSTICE GINSBURG join.

In 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation
Ordinance, which prohibits \"criminal street gang [ **\[ ...
\]**](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=1d3fbe49-21ad-4c7b-8b92-86714caf673c&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3WNT-PX70-004C-000X-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=gf4hk&earg=sr0&prid=4e4bf077-fd6e-4435-98d8-0d4c9c4d42a3)
members\" from \"loitering\" with one another or with other persons in
any public place. The question presented is whether the Supreme Court of
Illinois correctly held that the ordinance violates the [Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=1d3fbe49-21ad-4c7b-8b92-86714caf673c&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3WNT-PX70-004C-000X-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=gf4hk&earg=sr0&prid=4e4bf077-fd6e-4435-98d8-0d4c9c4d42a3).

I

Before the ordinance was adopted, the city council\'s Committee on
Police and Fire conducted hearings to explore the problems created by
the city\'s street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of
public loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the
neighborhoods where gang members are most active, as well as some of the
aldermen who represent those areas. Based on that evidence, the council
made a series of findings that are included in the text of the ordinance
and explain the reasons for its enactment.

The council found that a continuing increase in criminal street gang
activity was largely responsible for the city\'s rising murder rate, as
well as an escalation of violent and drug related crimes. It noted that
in many neighborhoods throughout the city, \"the burgeoning presence of
street gang members in public places has intimidated many law abiding
citizens.\" [177 Ill. 2d 440, 445, 687 N.E.2d 53, 58, 227 Ill. Dec. 130
(1997)](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=1d3fbe49-21ad-4c7b-8b92-86714caf673c&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3WNT-PX70-004C-000X-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=gf4hk&earg=sr0&prid=4e4bf077-fd6e-4435-98d8-0d4c9c4d42a3).
Furthermore, the council stated that gang members \"establish control
over identifiable areas . . . by loitering in those areas and
intimidating others from entering those areas; and . . . members of

The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to
\$ 500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and a requirement to
perform up to 120 hours of community service. Commission of the offense
involves four predicates. First, the police officer must reasonably
believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a
\"public place\" is a \"criminal street gang member.\" Second, the
persons must be \"loitering,\" which the ordinance defines as
\"remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose.\" Third, the
officer must then order \"all\" of the persons to disperse and remove
themselves \"from the area.\" Fourth, a person must disobey the
officer\'s order. If any person, whether a gang member or not, disobeys
the officer\'s order, that person is guilty of violating the ordinance.

During the three years of its enforcement, the police issued over 89,000
dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000 people for violating the
ordinance. In the ensuing enforcement proceedings, two trial judges
upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, but eleven others ruled
that it was invalid. In respondent Youkhana\'s case, the trial judge
held that the \"ordinance fails to notify individuals what conduct is
prohibited, and it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement by
police.\"

The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed. It held \"that the gang loitering
ordinance violates due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague
on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.\" [177

Furthermore, it concluded that the ordinance was \"not reasonably
susceptible to a limiting construction which would affirm its
validity.\"

We granted certiorari, 523 U.S. (1998), and now affirm. Like the
Illinois Supreme Court, we conclude that the ordinance enacted by the
city of Chicago is unconstitutionally vague.

III

The factual predicate for the city\'s ordinance is not in dispute. As
the city argues in its brief, \"the very presence of a large collection
of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on
on the public ways intimidates residents, who become afraid even to
leave their homes and go about their business. That, in turn, imperils
community residents\' sense of safety and security, detracts from
property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire neighborhoods.\"
The findings in the ordinance explain that it was motivated by these
concerns. We have no doubt that a law that directly prohibited such
intimidating conduct would be constitutional, but this ordinance broadly
covers a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertainty about
the scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for
respondents\' claim that the ordinance is too vague.

ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it may

The city\'s principal response to this concern about adequate notice is
that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after they have failed
to comply with an officer\'s order to disperse. \"Whatever problem is

if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear, but it does
buttress our conclusion that the entire ordinance fails to give the
ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is

The broad sweep of the ordinance also violates \"\'the requirement that
a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law
enforcement.\'\" [Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at
358](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=1d3fbe49-21ad-4c7b-8b92-86714caf673c&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3WNT-PX70-004C-000X-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=gf4hk&earg=sr0&prid=4e4bf077-fd6e-4435-98d8-0d4c9c4d42a3).
There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. In any public place in
the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang
member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The
mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order
without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes. It
matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for
example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan
or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either
event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she
may \-- indeed, she \"shall\" \-- order them to disperse.

Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of
innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its language to determine if it
\"necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the
policeman on his beat.\" [Kolender v. Lawson, **\[ ...

principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this
case is the definition of loitering as \"to remain in any one place with
no apparent purpose.\"

As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it \"provides
absolute discretion to police officers to determine what activities
constitute loitering.\" **\[ ... \]**

Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance not
only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also has the
perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage much of the
intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the city
council\'s findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is
motivated either by an apparent purpose to publicize the gang\'s
dominance of certain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by
an equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in illegal
drugs. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is affirmed.

FN2: The ordinance states in pertinent part: "(a) Whenever a police
officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal
street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other
persons, he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove
themselves from the area. Any person who does not promptly obey such an
order is in violation of this section. " (b) It shall be an affirmative
defense to an alleged violation of this section that no person who was
observed loitering was in fact a member of a criminal street gang. "(c)
As used in this section: "(1) 'Loiter' means to remain in any one place
with no apparent purpose. "(2) 'Criminal street gang' means any ongoing
organization, association in fact or group of three or more persons,
whether formal or informal, having as one of its substantial activities
the commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in
paragraph (3), and whose members individually or collectively engage in
or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity. . . . . . "(5)
'Public place' means the public way and any other location open to the
public, whether publicly or privately owned. "(e) Any person who
violates this Section is subject to a fine of not less than \$100 and
not more than \$500 for each offense, or imprisonment for not more than
six months, or both. "In addition to or instead of the above penalties,
any person who violates this section may be required to perform up to
120 hours of community service pursuant to section 1---4---120 of this
Code." Chicago Municipal Code §8---4---015 (added June 17, 1992),
reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a---63a.

1.  **Introduction**

... The Morales case was decided without much attention to race. Race
did not play a role in either the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion
overturning the Chicago ordinance or the United States Supreme Court's
affirmance. Yet issues of race are critical to the constitutionality of
the gang-loitering law from the perspectives of both its supporters and
its opponents. The disproportionate number of Blacks and Latinos
arrested under the ordinance alone suggests that race mattered in the
passage and enforcement of the ordinance. Racism is also one of the
motivating concerns underlying constitutional objections to vague
loitering laws like the Chicago ordinance. Ironically, race is also at
the center of the strongest argument in favor of upholding the
ordinance. Some of the law's defenders argue that Black support for the
ordinance demonstrates its efficacy at protecting inner-city communities
from crime and outweighs concerns about the violations of citizens'
civil liberties.

 

Given the predominance of race in the arguments both for and against the
gang-loitering ordinance, the debate about its constitutionality should
carefully address the relation between this and similar
order-maintenance policing measures and Black Americans' political and
social status. Is the disproportionate arrest of people of color under
the ordinance evidence of racial discrimination, or evidence that the
Chicago Police Department is finally starting to protect the city's
minority communities against internal disorder? Does the apparent
support of many inner-city residents for new policing techniques trump
constitutional arguments based on the racial disparity in the arrests?
To borrow the terms of the sociological theorists, are the social norms
enforced by order-maintenance policing beneficial or detrimental to
African Americans given current political conditions?  ...

1.  **Race and The Problem with Vagueness**

The Supreme Court held that the Chicago gang-loitering ordinance
violated the due process clause of the Constitution because it was an
excessively vague impairment of citizens' personal liberty to move
freely on the streets. Although this constitutional flaw can be
explained in race-neutral terms, in Chicago it resulted in a particular
racial injury; the gang-loitering law disproportionately violated the
rights of Black and Latino citizens. One of the main problems with vague
statutes is their capacity to further racial injustice in the criminal
justice system. Examining the relationship between racial inequality and
the vagueness doctrine in the context of Morales helps to illuminate the
political basis for this important constitutional shield against police
abuse.

 

Vague statutes pose two problems: when criminal codes fail to clearly
define the offense, citizens may not understand what conduct is
prohibited and police are likely to enforce the law in an arbitrary and
discriminatory manner. The Chicago law's definition of loitering raised
both of these problems. The ordinance directed police officers who
observe anyone whom they reasonably believe to be a gang member standing
in any public place "with no apparent purpose" with one or more other
persons to order the entire group to leave the area. Officers were
permitted to arrest anyone who fails to promptly obey the dispersal
order. The prohibition against remaining in a place without an "apparent
purpose" offers no guidance for determining what behavior an officer
might consider illegal. How can someone standing on a Chicago sidewalk
predict an observing officer's interpretation of her reason for being
there?

 

. . . Rather than coherently delineate the behavior that the ordinance
bans, the City Council left it to the police to distinguish between
criminal and legitimate public presence.  For this reason, the law's
broad language was also an invitation to police abuse. Giving police
officers the authority to determine on the spot the legality of conduct
creates the chief evil of vague criminal statutes. As the Court
recognized in prior decisions, "the most important aspect of the
vagueness doctrine is '. . . the requirement that a legislature
establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement." ' Without these
guidelines, police have a tendency to enforce the law against groups
that they despise. The city council deliberately made the law's reach
exceptionally wide "so that persons who are undesirable in the eyes of
the police and prosecutors can be convicted even though they are not
chargeable with any other particular offense." The Chicago Police
Department took full advantage of the leeway the ordinance granted. From
1992 until 1995, police issued over 89,000 orders to disperse and
arrested over 42,000 people for disobeying their orders. This is the
point of vague loitering laws: they permit the police to haul off the
streets people who look suspicious even though they have committed no
criminal conduct. In fighting its gang problem, the courts concluded,
"the city cannot empower the police to sweep undesirable persons from
the public streets through vague and arbitrary criminal ordinances."

 

Loitering laws inevitably involve judgments about people's criminal
propensity. They embody legislative predictions about the likelihood
that people engaged in certain activities, bearing certain
characteristics, or belonging to certain groups will engage in criminal
activity. This preventive measure is justified as a means of removing
crime-prone people from the streets before they have a chance to break
the law. Loitering laws, then, give the state an advantage in fighting
crime and maintaining public order. The vaguer the law, the greater the
benefit it provides as a prophylactic tool. The Supreme Court has
determined that vague loitering laws' infringement of liberty outweighs
any benefit for law enforcement these laws offer. Why should we fear so
much the state's power to identify people with a propensity for crime
and to remove them from the streets when this power might help to
guarantee safer neighborhoods?

 

One answer is that expansive and ambiguous allocations of police
discretion are likely to unjustly burden members of unpopular or
minority groups.  Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, perhaps the
Supreme Court's most important invalidation of vague loitering laws,
suggests this rationale.

...

In the United States, vagrancy-type laws served the same function in the
regime of white domination of Blacks. The colonies sought to prevent
slave rebellions by enacting laws that prohibited slaves from traveling
without a pass and permitted slave patrols to arrest slaves on mere
suspicion of sedition. After Emancipation, white southerners tied freed
Blacks to plantations through Black Codes that punished vagrancy. As the
Court described them, "vagrancy laws were used after the Civil War to
keep former slaves in a state of quasi slavery."  A more contemporary
example of the oppressive restriction of movement is the requirement of
the apartheid regime in South Africa that Blacks carry passes while
traveling in white districts.

 

The mandate that police arrest individuals who do not promptly disperse
and "remove themselves from the area" exacerbates this constitutional
violation. The obligation to leave **\*789** "the area" gives police
officers additional discretion to decide whether someone has complied
with their orders by moving far enough away. It also magnifies the
racist nature of the law's control over movement in the city. The
ordinance's leave-the-area requirement might be interpreted as an order
to leave the neighborhood, a site delineated in Chicago by race and
ethnicity.  As amici noted, "\[a\] law authorizing police to order
strangers back to their own neighborhood would make all-too-real the
concerns of Chicago aldermen who compared this ordinance to South
Africa's pass laws."

 

The arrest of the named plaintiff, Jesus Morales, illustrates the law's
potential for racial bias. Morales was arrested when he stood on a
street corner with five other Latino teenagers in a predominantly white
neighborhood. The arresting officer testified that he initially
approached the group "\[b\] ecause we wanted to know if they lived in
the neighborhood." He concluded that Morales was a gang member because
Morales wore blue and black clothes, the colors of the Gangster
Disciples street gang.  It appears that Morales became the subject of
suspicion because of his ethnicity: being Latino made his presence in a
white neighborhood alarming; it also made it seem likely that his
clothing signified gang membership. Vague loitering laws give license to
police officers to arrest people purely on the basis of race-based
suspicions like these.

## Vagrancy Then and Now

"Laws prohibiting loitering and vagrancy have been a fixture of
Anglo-American law at least since the time of the Norman Conquest,"
wrote Justice Thomas in his dissent in *City of Chicago v. Morales*.
*Morales* explored the meaning of the term loiter, but what        is
"vagrancy"? The term is often associated with idleness, but as a
criminal offence, vagrancy is notoriously hard to define. Arguably, that
is the point of the term: to capture an array of behaviors or conditions
that are not easily defined in a written statute. Here is one typical
vagrancy statute:

*Rogues and vagabonds, or dissolute persons who go about begging, common
gam- blers, persons who use juggling or unlawful games or plays, common
drunkards, common night walkers, thieves, pilferers or pickpockets,
traders in stolen prop- erty, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons,
keepers of gambling places, common railers and brawlers, persons
wandering or strolling around from place to place without any lawful
purpose or object, habitual loafers, disorderly persons, persons
neglecting all lawful business and habitually spending their time by
frequenting houses of ill fame, gaming houses, or places where alcoholic
beverages are sold or served, persons able to work but habitually living
upon the earnings of their wives or minor children shall be deemed
vagrants and, upon conviction in the Municipal Court shall be punished
as provided for Class D offenses.*

What is a rogue, a vagabond, a wanton person, a habitual loafer? This
particular statute, Jacksonville Ordinance Code § 26-57, was found to be
unconstitutionally vague in *Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville*
(1972). Until *Papachristou*, the legitimacy of vagrancy law was largely
taken for granted, and even after *Papachristou*, new versions of
vagrancy have persisted, as discussed below. According to one scholar,
vagrancy laws were popular among ruling authorities for two reasons.
"First, the laws' breadth and ambiguity gave the police virtually
unlimited discretion.... \[I\]t was almost always possible to justify a
vagrancy arrest." Risa Goluboff, *Vagrant* *Nation* 2 (2016).
Additionally, "vagrancy laws made it a crime to be a certain type of
person.... Where most American laws required people to do something
criminal before they could be arrested, vagrancy laws emphati- cally did
not." *Id*. "The goals was to prevent crimes which may likely flow from
a vagrant's mode of life.... Such preventive purpose wholly fails if a
law enforcement officer must wait until a crime is committed." Id.
(internal quotation marks omitted). Another function of vagrancy and
loitering laws, echoed by Chicago's approach to "gang loitering," was
sim- ply to enable police to clear public spaces of people thought to be
dangerous or other- wise undesirable. Once brought to court, many
persons arrested for vagrancy would be offered dismissal of the charges
on the condition that they leave the area and not return.

But in other contexts, the point of a vagrancy arrest was very
different. As the *Morales* plurality mentioned \[Fn. 2 in the opinion
as edited above\], "vagrancy laws were used after the Civil War to keep
former slaves in a state of quasi slavery." The Thirteenth Amend- ment
to the U.S. Constitution abolishes slavery "except as a punishment for
crime." After the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted, many southern states
sought to replace the lost labor of enslaved persons through a practice
known as "convict leasing." Black men and women were arrested and
prosecuted for vagrancy, then "leased" or "sold" to companies that would
force them to labor. A Pulitzer-Prize-winning historical study of
convict leas- ing opens with this example:

\"On March 30, 1908, Green Cottenham was arrested by the sheriff of
Shelby County, Alabama, and charged with vagrancy. Cottenham had
committed no true crime. Vagrancy, the offense of a person not being
able to prove at a given moment that he or she is employed, was ...
dredged up from legal obscurity at the end of the nineteenth century by
the state legisla- tures of Alabama and other southern states. It was
capriciously enforced by local sheriffs and constables, adjudicated by
mayors and notaries public ... and, most tellingly in a time of massive
unemployment among all southern men, was reserved almost exclusively for
black men. Cottenham's offense was blackness.

... Cottenham was found guilty in a swift appearance before the county
judge and immediately sentenced to a thirty-day term of hard labor.
Unable to pay the array of fees assessed on every prisoner ...
Cottenham's sentence was extended to nearly a year of hard labor. The
next day, Cottenham was sold \[to a mining company which would\] pay off
Cottenham's fine and fees.\"

\- from Douglas Blackmon, *Slavery By Another Name: The Re-Enslavement
of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II* (2008).

Convict leasing eventually came to an end after World War II, in part
because of a change in enforcement decisions: federal prosecutors
finally began to enforce the federal statutes that made "peonage," or
the use of forced labor, into a crime. Even so, the sep- arate vagrancy
statutes remained valid law. Indeed, even after the 1972 *Papachristou*
decision struck down the Jacksonville vagrancy ordinance quoted above,
and called into question the constitutionality of similar laws, vagrancy
did not exactly fade to obscurity. Florida enacted a new vagrancy law
that made it a crime "to loiter or prowl in a place,  at a time or in a
manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that
warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the
safety of persons or property in the vicinity." (See Goluboff, *Vagrant*
*Nation*, p. 331.) Chicago similarly re- enacted a new version of its
gang loitering ordinance after *Morales*, as discussed above. The
revised Florida loitering law and the revised gang loitering ordinance
are still in place as of 2024.

1930-139

No. 552

1931-03-09

Argued February 26, 27, 1931.

Mr. Justice Holmes

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner was convicted of transporting from Ottawa, Illinois, to
Guymon, Oklahoma, an airplane that he knew to have been stolen, and was
sentenced to serve three years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of
\$2,000. **\[ ... \]** A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on
the question whether the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act applies to
aircraft. Act of October 29, 1919**\[ ... \]**. That Act provides: "
Sec. 2. That when used in this Act: (a) The term 'motor vehicle' shall
include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motor cycle,
or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for .running on rails;
. . . Sec. 3. That whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in
interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle, knowing the same to have
been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than \$5,000, or by
imprisonment of not more than five years, or both."

**\[ ... \]**The question is the meaning of the word ' vehicle ' in the
phrase " any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on
rails." No doubt etymologically it is possible to use the word to
signify a conveyance working on land, water or air, and sometimes
legislation extends the use in that direction, e. g., land and air,
water being separately provided for, in the Tariff Act, September 22,
1922**\[ ... \]**. But in everyday speech ' vehicle ' calls up the
picture of a thing moving on land. **\[ ... \]**So here, the phrase
under discussion calls up the popular picture. For after including
automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words " any
other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails " still
indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running
on land, is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not
commonly called a vehicle, that flies. Airplanes were well known in
1919, when this statute was passed; but it is admitted that they were
not mentioned in the reports or in the debates in Congress. It is
impossible to read words that so carefully enumerate the different forms
of motor vehicles and have no reference of any kind to aircraft, as
including airplanes under a term that usage more and more precisely
confines to a different class. **\[ ... \]**

Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the
text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a
fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common
world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line
is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should
be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the
common mind only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the statute
should not be extended to aircraft, simply because it may seem to us
that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that, if the
legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been
used. **\[ ... \]**

**Opinion**

Justice GINSBURGannounced the judgment of the Court and delivered an
opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice BREYER, and Justice
SOTOMAYOR join.

John Yates, a commercial fisherman, caught undersized red grouper in
federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. To prevent federal authorities
from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a
crew member to toss the suspect catch into the sea. For this offense, he
was charged with, and convicted of, violating 18 U.S.C. § 1519, which
provides:

> \"Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,
> falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible
> object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the
> investigation or proper administration of any matter within the
> jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any
> case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any
> such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
> more than 20 years, or both.\"

Yates was also indicted and convicted under § 2232(a), which provides:

> \"Destruction or Removal of Property to Prevent Seizure.-Whoever,
> before, during, or after any search for or seizure of property by any
> person authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly destroys,
> damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or otherwise takes any
> action, or knowingly attempts to destroy, damage, waste, dispose of,
> transfer, or otherwise take any action, for the purpose of preventing
> or impairing the Government\'s lawful authority to take such property
> into its custody or control or to continue holding such property under
> its lawful custody and control, shall be fined under this title or
> imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\"

Yates does not contest his conviction for violating § 2232(a), but he
maintains that fish are not trapped within the term \"tangible object,\"
as that term is used in § 1519.

Section 1519was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116
Stat. 745, legislation designed to protect investors and restore trust
in financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation. A fish
is no doubt an object that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and
handled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable to
destruction. But it would cut § 1519loose from its financial-fraud
mooring to hold that it encompasses any and all objects, whatever their
size or significance, destroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in
Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and
accounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a matching
construction of § 1519is in order: A tangible object captured by § 1519,
we hold, must be one used to record or preserve information.

I

On August 23, 2007, the *Miss Katie,*a commercial fishing boat, was six
days into an expedition in the Gulf of Mexico. Her crew numbered three,
including Yates, the captain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to
inspect both recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John Jones of
the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission decided to board
the *Miss Katie*to check on the vessel\'s compliance with fishing rules.
Although the *Miss Katie* was far enough from the Florida coast to be in
exclusively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer Jones\'s
jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a federal agent by the
National Marine Fisheries Service, Officer Jones had authority to
enforce federal, as well as state, fishing laws.

Upon boarding the *Miss Katie,*Officer Jones noticed three red grouper
that appeared to be undersized hanging from a hook on the deck. At the
time, federal conservation regulations required immediate release of red
grouper less than 20 inches long. 50 C.F.R. § 622.37(d)(2)(ii)(effective
April 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil offense
punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension. See 16 U.S.C. §§
1857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).

Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board, Officer Jones
proceeded to inspect the ship\'s catch, setting aside and measuring only
fish that appeared to him to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones
ultimately determined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. A
fellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized fish on a
catch measurement verification form. With few exceptions, the measured
fish were between 19 and 20 inches; three were less than 19 inches; none
were less than 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring below
20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden crates,
Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the fish, thus segregated, in the
crates until the *Miss Katie* returned to port. Before departing,
Officer Jones issued Yates a citation for possession of undersized fish.

Four days later, after the *Miss Katie* had docked in Cortez, Florida,
Officer Jones measured the fish contained in the wooden crates. This
time, however, the measured fish, although still less than 20 inches,
slightly exceeded the lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the
fish brought to port were not the same as those he had detected during
his initial inspection. Under questioning, one of the crew members
admitted that, at Yates\'s direction, he had thrown overboard the fish
Officer Jones had measured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced
the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.

For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more than 32 months
passed before criminal charges were lodged against Yates. On May 5,
2010, he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal
seizure, in violation of § 2232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and
covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in
violation of § 1519.[^2]By the time of the indictment, the minimum legal
length for Gulf red grouper had been lowered from 20 inches to 18
inches. See 50 C.F.R. § 622.37(d)(2)(iv)(effective May 18, 2009). No
measured fish in Yates\'s catch fell below that limit. The record does
not reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his possession
of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation. See 16 U.S.C. § 1858(a).

Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011. At the end of
the Government\'s case in chief, he moved for a judgment of acquittal on
the § 1519charge. Pointing to § 1519\'s title and its origin as a
provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets
forth \"a documents offense\" and that its reference to \"tangible
object\[s\]\" subsumes \"computer hard drives, logbooks, \[and\] things
of that nature,\" not fish. App. 91-92. Yates acknowledged that the
Criminal Code contains \"sections that would have been appropriate for
the \[G\]overnment to pursue\" if it wished to prosecute him for
tampering with evidence. App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out *supra,*at
1-2, fit that description. But § 1519, Yates insisted, did not.

The Government countered that a \"tangible object\" within § 1519\'s
compass is \"simply something other than a document or record.\" App.
93. The trial judge expressed misgivings about reading \"tangible
object\" as broadly as the Government urged: \"Isn\'t there a Latin
phrase \[about\] construction of a statute\.... The gist of it is \...
you take a look at \[a\] line of words, and you interpret the words
consistently. So if you\'re talking about documents, and records,
tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document or a
record, as opposed to a fish.\" *Ibid.*The first-instance judge
nonetheless followed controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent. While
recognizing that § 1519was passed as part of legislation targeting
corporate fraud, the Court of Appeals had instructed that \"the broad
language of § 1519is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and
\'Congress is free to pass laws with language covering areas well beyond
the particular crisis *du jour*that initially prompted legislative
action.\' \" No. 2:10-cr-66-FtM-29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116
(quoting *United States v. Hunt,*526 F.3d 739, 744 (C.A.11 2008)).
Accordingly, the trial court read \"tangible object\" as a term
\"independent\" of \"record\" or \"document.\" App. 116. For violating §
1519and § 2232(a), the court sentenced Yates to imprisonment for 30
days, followed by supervised release for three years. App. 118-120. For
life, he will bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.

On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of § 1519 \"plain.\" 733
F.3d 1059, 1064 (2013). Because \"tangible object\" was \"undefined\" in
the statute, the Court of Appeals gave the term its \"ordinary or
natural meaning,\" *i.e.,*its dictionary definition, \"\[h\]aving or
possessing physical form.\" *Ibid.*(quoting Black\'s Law Dictionary 1592
(9th ed. 2009)).

We granted certiorari, 572 U.S. \-\-\--, 134 S.Ct. 1935, 188 L.Ed.2d 959
(2014), and now reverse the Eleventh Circuit\'s judgment.

II

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of
Enron\'s massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company\'s
outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed
potentially incriminating documents. The Government acknowledges that §
1519was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate
document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing. Brief for
United States 46. Prior law made it an offense to \"intimidat\[e\],
threate\[n\], or corruptly persuad\[e\] *another person*\" to shred
documents. § 1512(b) (emphasis added). Section 1519cured a conspicuous
omission by imposing liability on a person who destroys records himself.
See S.Rep. No. 107-146, p. 14(2002) (describing § 1519as \"a new general
anti shredding provision\" and explaining that \"certain current
provisions make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy
documents, but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents
yourself\"). The new section also expanded prior law by including within
the provision\'s reach \"any matter within the jurisdiction of any
department or agency of the United States.\" *Id.,*at 14-15.

In the Government\'s view, § 1519extends beyond the principal evil
motivating its passage. The words of § 1519, the Government argues,
support reading the provision as a general ban on the spoliation of
evidence, covering all physical items that might be relevant to any
matter under federal investigation.

Yates urges a contextual reading of § 1519, tying \"tangible object\" to
the surrounding words, the placement of the provision within the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related provisions enacted at the same time, in
particular § 1520 and § 1512(c)(1), see *infra,*at 1083, 1084 - 1085.
Section 1519, he maintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but
records, documents, and tangible objects used to preserve them,
*e.g.,*computers, servers, and other media on which information is
stored.

We agree with Yates and reject the Government\'s unrestrained reading.
\"Tangible object\" in § 1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only
objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects
in the physical world.

A

The ordinary meaning of an \"object\" that is \"tangible,\" as stated in
dictionary definitions, is \"a discrete \... thing,\" Webster\'s Third
New International Dictionary 1555 (2002), that \"possess\[es\] physical
form,\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise,
the Government concludes that \"tangible object,\" as that term appears
in § 1519, covers the waterfront, including fish from the sea.

Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn solely
on dictionary definitions of its component words. Rather, \"\[t\]he
plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined \[not only\]
by reference to the language itself, \[but as well by\] the specific
context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the
statute as a whole.\"*Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,*519 U.S. 337, 341, 117
S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). See also *Deal v. United States,*508
U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993)(it is a
\"fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of
language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in
isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used\").
Ordinarily, a word\'s usage accords with its dictionary definition. In
law as in life, however, the same words, placed in different contexts,
sometimes mean different things.

We have several times affirmed that identical language may convey
varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in
different provisions of the same statute. See, *e.g.,FAA v. Cooper,*566
U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\-- - \-\-\--, 132 S.Ct. 1441, 1448-1449, 182 L.Ed.2d
497 (2012), (\"actual damages\" has different meanings in different
statutes); *Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt,*546 U.S. 303, 313-314, 126
S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797 (2006)(\"located\" has different meanings in
different provisions of the National Bank Act); *General Dynamics Land
Systems, Inc. v. Cline,*540 U.S. 581, 595-597, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157
L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004)(\"age\" has different meanings in different
provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967); *United
States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,*532 U.S. 200, 213, 121 S.Ct.
1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001)(\"wages paid\" has different meanings in
different provisions of Title 26 U.S.C.); *Robinson,*519 U.S., at
342-344, 117 S.Ct. 843(\"employee\" has different meanings in different
sections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); *Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson,*478 U.S. 804, 807-808, 106 S.Ct. 3229,
92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986)( \"arising under\" has different meanings in U.S.
Const., Art. III, § 2, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331); *District of Columbia v.
Carter,*409 U.S. 418, 420-421, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613
(1973)(\"State or Territory\" has different meanings in 42 U.S.C. §
1982and § 1983); *Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States,*286
U.S. 427, 433-437, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932)(\"trade or
commerce\" has different meanings in different sections of the Sherman
Act). As the Court observed in *Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,*286 U.S., at
433, 52 S.Ct. 607:

> \"Most words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be
> variously construed\.... Where the subject matter to which the words
> refer is not the same in the several places where \[the words\] are
> used, or the conditions are different, or the scope of the legislative
> power exercised in one case is broader than that exercised in another,
> the meaning well may vary to meet the purposes of the law, to be
> arrived at by a consideration of the language in which those purposes
> are expressed, and of the circumstances under which the language was
> employed.\"[^3]

In short, although dictionary definitions of the words \"tangible\" and
\"object\" bear consideration, they are not dispositive of the meaning
of \"tangible object\" in § 1519.

Supporting a reading of \"tangible object,\" as used in § 1519, in
accord with dictionary definitions, the Government points to the
appearance of that term in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. That
Rule requires the prosecution to grant a defendant\'s request to inspect
\"tangible objects\" within the Government\'s control that have utility
for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(E).

Rule 16\'s reference to \"tangible objects\" has been interpreted to
include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O.
Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 20.3(g), pp. 405-406, and n. 120 (3d ed.
2007). Rule 16is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by
compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material
to the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive construction
of \"tangible objects\" is fitting. In contrast, § 1519is a penal
provision that refers to \"tangible object\" not in relation to a
request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding, but
rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every
kind, including those not yet begun.[^4]See *Commissioner v. National
Carbide Corp.,*167 F.2d 304, 306 (C.A.2 1948)(Hand, J.) (\"words are
chameleons, which reflect the color of their environment\"). Just as the
context of Rule 16supports giving \"tangible object\" a meaning as broad
as its dictionary definition, the context of § 1519tugs strongly in
favor of a narrower reading.

B

Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words
\"tangible object\" as they appear in § 1519.

We note first § 1519\'s caption: \"Destruction, alteration, or
falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\"
That heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation
of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records. Neither
does the title of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which §
1519was placed, § 802: \"Criminal penalties for altering documents.\"
116 Stat. 800. Furthermore, § 1520, the only other provision passed as
part of § 802, is titled \"Destruction of corporate audit records\" and
addresses only that specific subset of records and documents. While
these headings are not commanding, they supply cues that Congress did
not intend \"tangible object\" in § 1519to sweep within its reach
physical objects of every kind, including things no one would describe
as records, documents, or devices closely associated with them. See
*Almendarez-Torres v. United States,*523 U.S. 224, 234, 118 S.Ct. 1219,
140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)(\"\[T\]he title of a statute and the heading of a
section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the
meaning of a statute.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). If Congress
indeed meant to make § 1519an all-encompassing ban on the spoliation of
evidence, as the dissent believes Congress did, one would have expected
a clearer indication of that intent.

Section 1519\'s position within Chapter 73 of Title 18 further signals
that § 1519was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the
destruction of physical evidence of every kind. Congress placed §
1519(and its companion provision § 1520) at the end of the chapter,
following immediately after the pre-existing § 1516, § 1517, and § 1518,
each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific contexts. See §
1516 (audits of recipients of federal funds); § 1517 (federal
examinations of financial institutions); § 1518 (criminal investigations
of federal health care offenses).

See also S.Rep. No. 107-146, at 7(observing that § 1517 and § 1518
\"apply to obstruction in certain limited types of cases, such as
bankruptcy fraud, examinations of financial institutions, and healthcare
fraud\").

But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\'s
other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to these specialized provisions.
Instead, Congress directed placement of those additions within or
alongside retained provisions that address obstructive acts relating
broadly to official proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806,
\"Civil Action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,\" was
codified as § 1514A and inserted between the pre-existing § 1514, which
addresses civil actions to restrain harassment of victims and witnesses
in criminal cases, and § 1515, which defines terms used in § 1512 and §
1513. Section 1102, \"Tampering with a record or otherwise impeding an
official proceeding,\" was codified as § 1512(c) and inserted within the
pre-existing § 1512, which addresses tampering with a victim, witness,
or informant to impede any official proceeding. Section 1107,
\"Retaliation against informants,\" was codified as § 1513(e) and
inserted within the pre-existing § 1513, which addresses retaliation
against a victim, witness, or informant in any official proceeding.
Congress thus ranked § 1519, not among the broad proscriptions, but
together with specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud
and financial audits. This placement accords with the view that
Congress\' conception of § 1519\'s coverage was considerably more
limited than the Government\'s.[^5]

The contemporaneous passage of § 1512(c)(1), which was contained in a
section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete from the section embracing §
1519and § 1520, is also instructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides:

> \"(c) Whoever corruptly-
>
> \"(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or
> other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the
> object\'s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding

. . . . .

> \"shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20
> years, or both.\"

The legislative history reveals that § 1512(c)(1) was drafted and
proposed after § 1519. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518, 13088-13089 (2002). The
Government argues, and Yates does not dispute, that § 1512(c)(1)\'s
reference to \"other object\" includes any and every physical object.
But if § 1519\'s reference to \"tangible object\" already included all
physical objects, as the Government and the dissent contend, then
Congress had no reason to enact § 1512(c)(1): Virtually any act that
would violate § 1512(c)(1) no doubt would violate § 1519as well, for §
1519applies to \"the investigation or proper administration of any
matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United
States \... or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter,\" not
just to \"an official proceeding.\"[^6]

The Government acknowledges that, under its reading, § 1519and §
1512(c)(1)\"significantly overlap.\" Brief for United States 49. Nowhere
does the Government explain what independent function § 1512(c)(1)would
serve if the Government is right about the sweeping scope of § 1519. We
resist a reading of § 1519that would render superfluous an entire
provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act.[^7]See *Marx v.
General Revenue Corp.,*568 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\--, 133 S.Ct. 1166, 1178,
185 L.Ed.2d 242 (2013)( \"\[T\]he canon against surplusage is strongest
when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same
statutory scheme.\").

The words immediately surrounding \"tangible object\" in §
1519-\"falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record \[or\]
document\"-also cabin the contextual meaning of that term. As explained
in *Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,*513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131
L.Ed.2d 1 (1995), we rely on the principle of *noscitur a sociis-*a word
is known by the company it keeps-to \"avoid ascribing to one word a
meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words,
thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\" (internal
quotation marks omitted). See also *United States v. Williams,*553 U.S.
285, 294, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008)(\"a word is given more
precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated\").
In *Gustafson,*we interpreted the word \"communication\" in § 2(10) of
the Securities Act of 1933 to refer to a public communication, rather
than any communication, because the word appeared in a list with other
words, notably \"notice, circular, \[and\] advertisement,\" making it
\"apparent that the list refer\[red\] to documents of wide
dissemination.\" 513 U.S., at 575-576, 115 S.Ct. 1061. And we did so
even though the list began with the word \"any.\"

The *noscitur a sociis*canon operates in a similar manner here.
\"Tangible object\" is the last in a list of terms that begins \"any
record \[or\] document.\" The term is therefore appropriately read to
refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of
tangible objects involving records and documents, *i.e.,* objects used
to record or preserve information. See United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014) (\"
\'Records, documents, or tangible objects\' includes (A) records,
documents, or tangible objects that are stored on, or that are,
magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage mediums
or devices; and (B) wire or electronic communications.\").

This moderate interpretation of \"tangible object\" accords with the
list of actions § 1519proscribes. The section applies to anyone who
\"alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, *falsifies,*or
*makes a false entry in*any record, document, or tangible object\" with
the requisite obstructive intent. (Emphasis added.) The last two verbs,
\"falsif\[y\]\" and \"mak\[e\] a false entry in,\" typically take as
grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or
preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See, *e.g.,*
Black\'s Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"falsify\" as
\"\[t\]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp.,
to tamper with (a document, record, etc.)\"). It would be unnatural, for
example, to describe a killer\'s act of wiping his fingerprints from a
gun as \"falsifying\" the murder weapon. But it would not be strange to
refer to \"falsifying\" data stored on a hard drive as simply
\"falsifying\" a hard drive. Furthermore, Congress did not include on §
1512(c)(1)\'s list of prohibited actions \"falsifies\" or \"makes a
false entry in.\" See § 1512(c)(1)(making it unlawful to \"alte\[r\],
destro \[y\], mutilat\[e\], or concea\[l\] a record, document, or other
object\" with the requisite obstructive intent). That contemporaneous
omission also suggests that Congress intended \"tangible object\" in §
1519to have a narrower scope than \"other object\" in § 1512(c)(1).[^8]

A canon related to *noscitur a sociis, ejusdem generis,*counsels:
\"Where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,
the general words are \[usually\] construed to embrace only objects
similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific
words.\" *Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.
Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,*537 U.S. 371, 384, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154
L.Ed.2d 972 (2003)(internal quotation marks omitted). In *Begay v.
United States,*553 U.S. 137, 142-143, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490
(2008), for example, we relied on this principle to determine what
crimes were covered by the statutory phrase \"any crime \... that \...
is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or
otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another,\"18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The
enumeration of specific crimes, we explained, indicates that the
\"otherwise involves\" provision covers \"only *similar* crimes, rather
than *every* crime that \'presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.\' \" 553 U.S., at 142, 128 S.Ct. 1581. Had Congress
intended the latter \"all encompassing\" meaning, we observed, \"it is
hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all.\"
*Ibid.*See also *CSX*

*Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue,*562 U.S. 277, \-\-\--, 131
S.Ct. 1101, 1113, 179 L.Ed.2d 37 (2011)(\"We typically use *ejusdem
generis* to ensure that a general word will not render specific words
meaningless.\"). Just so here. Had Congress intended \"tangible object\"
in § 1519to be interpreted so generically as to capture physical objects
as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress would have had no reason
to refer specifically to \"record\" or \"document.\" The Government\'s
unbounded reading of \"tangible object\" would render those words
misleading surplusage.

Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine
markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and §
1519itself, we are persuaded that an aggressive interpretation of
\"tangible object\" must be rejected. It is highly improbable that
Congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering objects
of any and every kind in a provision targeting fraud in financial
record-keeping.

The Government argues, however, that our inquiry would be incomplete if
we failed to consider the origins of the phrase \"record, document, or
tangible object.\" Congress drew that phrase, the Government says, from
a 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) provision, and reform proposals based on
that provision. The MPC provision and proposals prompted by it would
have imposed liability on anyone who \"alters, destroys, mutilates,
conceals, or removes a record, document or thing.\" See ALI, MPC §
241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were understood to refer to
all physical evidence. See MPC § 241.7, Comment 3, at 179 (1980)
(provision \"applies to any physical object\"). Accordingly, the
Government reasons, and the dissent exuberantly agrees, *post,*at 4-5,
Congress must have intended § 1519to apply to the universe of physical
evidence.

The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC provision prohibited
tampering with any kind of physical evidence. But unlike § 1519, the MPC
provision did not prohibit actions that specifically relate to records,
documents, and objects used to record or preserve information. The MPC
provision also ranked the offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability
to instances in which the actor \"believ\[es\] that an official
proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted.\" MPC
§ 241.7(1), at 175. Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a
felony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a time when even
the smallest of the fish he caught came within the legal limit. See
*supra,*at 1080; cf. *Bond v. United States,*572 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\--,
134 S.Ct. 2077, 2089-2090, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014)(rejecting \"boundless
reading\" of a statutory term given \"deeply serious consequences\" that
reading would entail). A proposed federal offense in line with the MPC
provision, advanced by a federal commission in 1971, was similarly
qualified. See Final Report of the National Commission on Reform of
Federal Criminal Laws § 1323, pp. 116-117 (1971).

Section 1519conspicuously lacks the limits built into the MPC provision
and the federal proposal. It describes not a misdemeanor, but a felony
punishable by up to 20 years in prison. And the section covers conduct
intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, including
one not even on the verge of commencement. Given these significant
differences, the meaning of \"record, document, or thing\" in the MPC
provision and a kindred proposal is not a reliable indicator of the
meaning Congress assigned to \"record, document, or tangible object\" in
§ 1519. The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither \"what Congress
wrote \[nor\] what Congress wanted,\" cf. *post,*at 1098, concerning
Yates\'s small fish as the subject of a federal felony prosecution.

C

Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction
leaves any doubt about the meaning of \"tangible object,\" as that term
is used in § 1519, we would invoke the rule that \"ambiguity concerning
the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\"
*Cleveland v. United States,*531 U.S. 12, 25, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d
221 (2000)(quoting *Rewis v. United States,*401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct.
1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971)). That interpretative principle is relevant
here, where the Government urges a reading of § 1519that exposes
individuals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with *any*physical
object that *might*have evidentiary value in *any*federal investigation
into *any*offense, no matter whether the investigation is pending or
merely contemplated, or whether the offense subject to investigation is
criminal or civil. See *Liparota v. United States,*471 U.S. 419, 427,
105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985)(\"Application of the rule of
lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning
concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance
between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in defining
criminal liability.\"). In determining the meaning of \"tangible
object\" in § 1519, \"it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher
alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language
that is clear and definite.\" See *Cleveland,*531 U.S., at 25, 121 S.Ct.
365(quoting *United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp.,*344 U.S.
218, 222, 73 S.Ct. 227, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952)). See also *Jones v. United
States,*529 U.S. 848, 858-859, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902
(2000)(rule of lenity \"reinforces\" the conclusion that arson of an
owner-occupied residence is not subject to federal prosecution under 18
U.S.C. § 844(i)because such a residence does not qualify as property
\"used in\" commerce or commerce-affecting activity).[^9]

For the reasons stated, we resist reading § 1519expansively to create a
coverall spoliation of evidence statute, advisable as such a measure
might be. Leaving that important decision to Congress, we hold that a
\"tangible object\" within § 1519\'s compass is one used to record or
preserve information. The judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.

*It is so ordered.*

Justice ALITO, concurring in the judgment.

This case can and should be resolved on narrow grounds. And though the
question is close, traditional tools of statutory construction confirm
that John Yates has the better of the argument. Three features of 18
U.S.C. § 1519stand out to me: the statute\'s list of nouns, its list of
verbs, and its title. Although perhaps none of these features by itself
would tip the case in favor of Yates, the three combined do so.

Start with the nouns. Section 1519refers to \"any record, document, or
tangible object.\" The *noscitur a sociis*canon instructs that when a
statute contains a list, each word in that list presumptively has a
\"similar\" meaning. See, *e.g.,* *Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,*513 U.S.
561, 576, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995). A related canon,
*ejusdem generis*teaches that general words following a list of specific
words should usually be read in light of those specific words to mean
something \"similar.\" See, *e.g.,* *Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham
Corp.,*567 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\--, 132 S.Ct. 2156, 2171, 183 L.Ed.2d 153
(2012). Applying these canons to § 1519\'s list of nouns, the term
\"tangible object\" should refer to something similar to records or
documents. A fish does not spring to mind-nor does an antelope, a
colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an oil derrick. All are \"objects\"
that are \"tangible.\" But who wouldn\'t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor,
when asked to identify something similar to a \"record\" or
\"document,\" said \"crocodile\"?

This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For instance, this is an
imperfect *ejusdem generis*case because \"record\" and \"document\" are
themselves quite general. And there is a risk that \"tangible object\"
may be made superfluous-what is similar to a \"record\" or \"document\"
but yet is not one? An e-mail, however, could be such a thing. See
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2J1.2and
comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading \"records, documents, or tangible
objects\" to \"includ\[e\]\" what is found on \"magnetic, optical,
digital, other electronic, or other storage mediums or devices\"). An
e-mail, after all, might not be a \"document\" if, as was
\"traditionally\" so, a document was a \"piece of paper with information
on it,\" not \"information stored on a computer, electronic storage
device, or any other medium.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 587-588 (10th ed.
2014). E-mails might also not be \"records\" if records are limited to
\"minutes\" or other formal writings \"designed to memorialize \[past\]
events.\" *Id.,*at 1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can
contain files that are precisely akin to even these narrow definitions.
Both \"record\" and \"document\" can be read more expansively, but
adding \"tangible object\" to § 1519would ensure beyond question that
electronic files are included. To be sure, \"tangible object\"
presumably can capture more than just e-mails; Congress enacts
\"catchall\[s\]\" for \"known unknowns.\" *Republic of Iraq v.
Beaty,*556 U.S. 848, 860, 129 S.Ct. 2183, 173 L.Ed.2d 1193 (2009). But
where *noscitur a sociis*and *ejusdem generis*apply, \"known unknowns\"
should be similar to known knowns, *i.e.,* here, records and documents.
This is especially true because reading \"tangible object\" too broadly
could render \"record\" and \"document\" superfluous.

Next, consider § 1519\'s list of verbs: \"alters, destroys, mutilates,
conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in.\"

Although many of those verbs could apply to nouns as far-flung as
salamanders, satellites, or sand dunes, the last phrase in the
list-\"makes a false entry in\"-makes no sense outside of filekeeping.
How does one make a false entry in a fish? \"Alters\" and especially
\"falsifies\" are also closely associated with filekeeping. Not one of
the verbs, moreover, *cannot*be applied to filekeeping-certainly not in
the way that \"makes a false entry in\" is always inconsistent with the
aquatic.

Again, the Government is not without a response. One can imagine
Congress trying to write a law so broadly that not every verb lines up
with every noun. But failure to \"line up\" may suggest that something
has gone awry in one\'s interpretation of a text. Where, as here, each
of a statute\'s verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there is
some reason to think that Congress had that category in mind.
Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or overinclusive-§ 1519,
for instance, applies to a bomb-threatening letter but not a bomb. But
this does not mean that categories are not useful or that Congress does
not enact them. See, *e.g.,* *Vance v. Bradley,*440 U.S. 93, 108-109, 99
S.Ct. 939, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979). Here, focusing on the verbs, the
category of nouns appears to be filekeeping. This observation is not
dispositive, but neither is it nothing. The Government also contends
that § 1519\'s verbs cut both ways because it is unnatural to apply
\"falsifies\" to tangible objects, and that is certainly true. One does
not falsify the outside casing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or
alter data physically recorded on that hard drive.

Finally, my analysis is influenced by § 1519\'s title: \"Destruction,
alteration, or falsification of *records*in Federal investigations and
bankruptcy.\" (Emphasis added.) This too points toward filekeeping, not
fish. Titles can be useful devices to resolve \" \'doubt about the
meaning of a statute.\' \" *Porter v. Nussle,*534 U.S. 516, 527-528, 122
S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002)(quoting *Almendarez-Torres v. United
States,*523 U.S. 224, 234, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)); see
also *Lawson v. FMR LLC,*571 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\-- - \-\-\--, 134 S.Ct.
1158, 1162-1164, 188 L.Ed.2d 158 (2014)(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). The
title is especially valuable here because it reinforces what the text\'s
nouns and verbs independently suggest-that no matter how other statutes
might be read, this particular one does not cover every noun in the
universe with tangible form.

Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the list of nouns
did not already suggest that \"tangible object\" should mean something
similar to records or documents, especially when read in conjunction
with § 1519\'s peculiar list of verbs with their focus on filekeeping,
then the title would not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those
other two textual features, however, the Government\'s argument, though
colorable, becomes too implausible to accept. See, *e.g.,Washington
State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of
Keffeler,*537 U.S. 371, 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972
(2003)(focusing on the \"product of \[two\] canons of construction\"
which was \"confirmed\" by other interpretative evidence); cf. *Al-Adahi
v. Obama,*613 F.3d 1102, 1105-1106 (C.A.D.C.2010)(aggregating evidence).

Justice KAGAN, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice
THOMASjoin, dissenting.

A criminal law, 18 U.S.C. § 1519, prohibits tampering with \"any record,
document, or tangible object\" in an attempt to obstruct a federal
investigation. This case raises the question whether the term \"tangible
object\" means the same thing in § 1519as it means in everyday
language-any object capable of being touched. The answer should be easy:
Yes. The term \"tangible object\" is broad, but clear. Throughout the
U.S. Code and many States\' laws, it invariably covers physical objects
of all kinds. And in § 1519, context confirms what bare text says: All
the words surrounding \"tangible object\" show that Congress meant the
term to have a wide range. That fits with Congress\'s evident purpose in
enacting § 1519: to punish those who alter or destroy physical
evidence-*any* physical evidence-with the intent of thwarting federal
law enforcement.

The plurality instead interprets \"tangible object\" to cover \"only
objects one can use to record or preserve information.\" *Ante,* at
1081. The concurring opinion similarly, if more vaguely, contends that
\"tangible object\" should refer to \"something similar to records or
documents\"-and shouldn\'t include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or
fish. *Ante,* at 1089 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). In my view,
conventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a more
conventional result: A \"tangible object\" is an object that\'s
tangible. I would apply the statute that Congress enacted and affirm the
judgment below.

I

While the plurality starts its analysis with § 1519\'s heading, see
*ante,*at 1083 (\"We note first § 1519\'s caption\"), I would begin with
§ 1519\'s text. When Congress has not supplied a definition, we
generally give a statutory term its ordinary meaning. See, *e.g.,*
*Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk,*563 U.S.
\-\-\--, \-\-\--, 131 S.Ct. 1885, 1891, 179 L.Ed.2d 825 (2011). As the
plurality must acknowledge, the ordinary meaning of \"tangible object\"
is \"a discrete thing that possesses physical form.\" *Ante,*at 1081
(punctuation and citation omitted). A fish is, of course, a discrete
thing that possesses physical form. See generally Dr. Seuss, One Fish
Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960). So the ordinary meaning of the term
\"tangible object\" in § 1519, as no one here disputes, covers fish
(including too-small red grouper).

That interpretation accords with endless uses of the term in statute and
rule books as construed by courts. Dozens of federal laws and rules of
procedure (and hundreds of state enactments) include the term \"tangible
object\" or its first cousin \"tangible thing\"-some in association with
documents, others not. See, *e.g.,* 7 U.S.C. § 8302(2)(referring to
\"any material or tangible object that could harbor a pest or
disease\"); 15 U.S.C. § 57b-1(c)(authorizing investigative demands for
\"documentary material or tangible things\"); 18 U.S.C. §
668(a)(1)(D)(defining \"museum\" as entity that owns \"tangible objects
that are exhibited to the public\"); 28 U.S.C. § 2507(b)(allowing
discovery of \"relevant facts, books, papers, documents or tangible
things\").[^10]To my knowledge, no court has ever read any such
provision to exclude things that don\'t record or preserve data; rather,
all courts have adhered to the statutory language\'s ordinary (*i.e.,*
expansive) meaning. For example, courts have understood the phrases
\"tangible objects\" and \"tangible things\" in the Federal Rules of
Criminal and Civil Procedure to cover everything from guns to drugs to
machinery to \... animals. See, *e.g.,United States v. Obiukwu,*17 F.3d
816, 819 (C.A.6 1994)(*per curiam*) (handgun); *United States v.
Acarino,*270 F.Supp. 526, 527-528 (E.D.N.Y.1967)(heroin); *In re
Newman,*782 F.2d 971, 972-975 (C.A.Fed.1986)(energy generation system);
*Martin v. Reynolds Metals Corp.,*297 F.2d 49, 56-57 (C.A.9
1961)(cattle). No surprise, then, that-until today-courts have uniformly
applied the term \"tangible object\" in § 1519 in the same way. See,
*e.g.,United States v. McRae,*702 F.3d 806, 834-838 (C.A.5
2012)(corpse); *United States v. Maury,*695 F.3d 227, 243-244 (C.A.3
2012)(cement mixer).

That is not necessarily the end of the matter; I agree with the
plurality (really, who does not?) that context matters in interpreting
statutes. We do not \"construe the meaning of statutory terms in a
vacuum.\" *Tyler v. Cain,*533 U.S. 656, 662, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d
632 (2001). Rather, we interpret particular words \"in their context and
with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\" *Davis v.
Michigan Dept. of Treasury,*489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103
L.Ed.2d 891 (1989). And sometimes that means, as the plurality says,
that the dictionary definition of a disputed term cannot control. See,
*e.g.,Bloate v. United States,* 559 U.S. 196, 205, n. 9, 130 S.Ct. 1345,
176 L.Ed.2d 54 (2010). But this is not such an occasion, for here the
text and its context point the same way. Stepping back from the words
\"tangible object\" provides only further evidence that Congress said
what it meant and meant what it said.

Begin with the way the surrounding words in § 1519reinforce the breadth
of the term at issue. Section 1519refers to \"any\" tangible object,
thus indicating (in line with *that* word\'s plain meaning) a tangible
object \"of whatever kind.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 97 (2002). This Court has time and again recognized that
\"any\" has \"an expansive meaning,\" bringing within a statute\'s reach
*all*types of the item (here, \"tangible object\") to which the law
refers. *Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker,*535 U.S.
125, 131, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258 (2002); see, *e.g.,* *Republic
of Iraq v. Beaty,*556 U.S. 848, 856, 129 S.Ct. 2183, 173 L.Ed.2d 1193
(2009); *Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,*552 U.S. 214, 219-220, 128
S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). And the adjacent laundry list of
verbs in § 1519(\"alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,
falsifies, or makes a false entry\") further shows that Congress wrote a
statute with a wide scope. Those words are supposed to ensure-just as
\"tangible object\" is meant to-that § 1519covers the whole world of
evidence-tampering, in all its prodigious variety. See *United States v.
Rodgers,*466 U.S. 475, 480, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 80 L.Ed.2d 492
(1984)(rejecting a \"narrow, technical definition\" of a statutory term
when it \"clashes strongly\" with \"sweeping\" language in the same
sentence).

Still more, \"tangible object\" appears as part of a three-noun phrase
(including also \"records\" and \"documents\") common to
evidence-tampering laws and always understood to embrace things of all
kinds. The Model Penal Code\'s evidence-tampering section, drafted more
than 50 years ago, similarly prohibits a person from \"alter\[ing\],
destroy\[ing\], conceal\[ing\] or remov\[ing\]

any *record, document or thing*\" in an effort to thwart an official
investigation or proceeding. ALI, Model Penal Code § 241.7(1), p. 175
(1962) (emphasis added). The Code\'s commentary emphasizes that the
offense described in that provision is \"not limited to conduct that
\[alters\] a written instrument.\" *Id.,*§ 241.7, Comment 3, at 179.
Rather, the language extends to \"any physical object.\" *Ibid.*
Consistent with that statement-and, of course, with ordinary
meaning-courts in the more than 15 States that have laws based on the
Model Code\'s tampering provision apply them to all tangible objects,
including drugs, guns, vehicles and \... yes, animals. See, *e.g.,State
v. Majors,*318 S.W.3d 850, 859-861 (Tenn.2010)(cocaine); *Puckett v.
State,*328 Ark. 355, 357-360, 944 S.W.2d 111, 113-114 (1997)(gun);
*State v. Bruno,*236 Conn. 514, 519-520, 673 A.2d 1117, 1122-1123
(1996)(bicycle, skeleton, blood stains); *State v. Crites,*2007 Mont.
Dist. LEXIS 615, \*5-\*7 (Dec. 21, 2007) (deer antlers). Not a one has
limited the phrase\'s scope to objects that record or preserve
information.

The words \"record, document, or tangible object\" in § 1519also track
language in 18 U.S.C. § 1512, the federal witness-tampering law covering
(as even the plurality accepts, see *ante,*at 1084) physical evidence in
all its forms. Section 1512, both in its original version (preceding §
1519) and today, repeatedly uses the phrase \"record, document, or other
object\"-most notably, in a provision prohibiting the use of force or
threat to induce another person to withhold any of those materials from
an official proceeding. § 4(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act
of 1982, 96 Stat. 1249, as amended, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(2). That
language, which itself likely derived from the Model Penal Code,
encompasses no less the bloody knife than the incriminating letter, as
all courts have for decades agreed. See, *e.g.,United States v.
Kellington,*217 F.3d 1084, 1088 (C.A.9 2000)(boat); *United States v.
Applewhaite,*195 F.3d 679, 688 (C.A.3 1999)(stone wall). And typically
\"only the most compelling evidence\" will persuade this Court that
Congress intended \"nearly identical language\" in provisions dealing
with related subjects to bear different meanings. *Communications
Workers v. Beck,*487 U.S. 735, 754, 108 S.Ct. 2641, 101 L.Ed.2d 634
(1988); see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of
Legal Texts 252 (2012). Context thus again confirms what text indicates.

And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts extra icing
on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the plurality notes, see
*ante,*at 1079, 1081, was enacted after the Enron Corporation\'s
collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. But
the provision began its life in a separate bill, and the drafters
emphasized that Enron was \"only a case study exposing the shortcomings
in our current laws\" relating to both \"corporate and criminal\" fraud.
S.Rep. No. 107-146, pp. 2, 11(2002). The primary \"loophole\[ \]\"
Congress identified, see *id.,*at 14, arose from limits in the part of §
1512just described: That provision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a
person from inducing another to destroy \"record\[s\], document\[s\], or
other object\[s\]\"-of every type-but not from doing so himself. §
1512(b)(2); see *supra,*at 1093. Congress (as even the plurality agrees,
see *ante,*at 1081) enacted § 1519to close that yawning gap. But §
1519could fully achieve that goal only if it covered all the records,
documents, and objects § 1512did, as well as all the means of tampering
with them. And so § 1519was written to do exactly that-\"to apply
broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical evidence,\" as long
as performed with the requisite intent. S.Rep. No. 107-146, at 14.
\"When a person destroys evidence,\" the drafters explained, \"overly
technical legal distinctions should neither hinder nor prevent
prosecution.\" *Id.,*at 7. Ah well: Congress, meet today\'s Court, which
here invents just such a distinction with just such an effect. See
*United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank,*374 U.S. 321, 343, 83 S.Ct.
1715, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963)(\"\[C\]reat\[ing\] a large loophole in a
statute designed to close a loophole\" is \"illogical and disrespectful
of \... congressional purpose\").

As Congress recognized in using a broad term, giving immunity to those
who destroy non-documentary evidence has no sensible basis in penal
policy. A person who hides a murder victim\'s body is no less culpable
than one who burns the victim\'s diary. A fisherman, like John Yates,
who dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less blameworthy than
one who shreds his vessel\'s catch log for the same reason. Congress
thus treated both offenders in the same way. It understood, in enacting
§ 1519, that destroying evidence is destroying evidence, whether or not
that evidence takes documentary form.

II

A

The plurality searches far and wide for anything-*anything*-to support
its interpretation of § 1519. But its fishing expedition comes up empty.

The plurality\'s analysis starts with § 1519\'s title: \"Destruction,
alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and
bankruptcy.\" See *ante,*at 1083; see also *ante,*at 1090 (opinion of
ALITO, J.). That\'s already a sign something is amiss. I know of no
other case in which we have *begun*our interpretation of a statute with
the title, or relied on a title to override the law\'s clear terms.
Instead, we have followed \"the wise rule that the title of a statute
and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning of the
text.\" *Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,*331 U.S. 519, 528-529, 67
S.Ct. 1387, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947).

The reason for that \"wise rule\" is easy to see: A title is, almost
necessarily, an abridgment. Attempting to mention every term in a
statute \"would often be ungainly as well as useless\"; accordingly,
\"matters in the text \... are frequently unreflected in the headings.\"
*Id.,*at 528, 67 S.Ct. 1387. Just last year, this Court observed that
two titles in a nearby section of Sarbanes-Oxley serve as \"but a
short-hand reference to the general subject matter\" of the provision at
issue, \"not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the
text.\" *Lawson v. FMR LLC,*571 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\--, 134 S.Ct. 1158,
1169, 188 L.Ed.2d 158 (2014)(quoting *Trainmen,*331 U.S., at 528, 67
S.Ct. 1387). The \"under-inclusiveness\" of the headings, we stated, was
\"apparent.\" *Lawson,*571 U.S., at \-\-\--, 134 S.Ct., at 1169. So too
for § 1519\'s title, which refers to \"destruction, alteration, or
falsification\" but *not* to mutilation, concealment, or covering up,
and likewise mentions \"records\" but *not* other documents or objects.
Presumably, the plurality would not refuse to apply § 1519when a person
only conceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsifying
it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a title, which
cannot \"undo or limit\" more specific statutory text. *Ibid.*(quoting
*Trainmen,*331 U.S., at 529, 67 S.Ct. 1387). The same holds true when
the evidence in question is not a \"record\" but something else whose
destruction, alteration, etc., is intended to obstruct justice.

The plurality next tries to divine meaning from § 1519\'s \"position
within Chapter 73 of Title 18.\" *Ante,*at 1083. But that move is yet
odder than the last. As far as I can tell, this Court has never once
suggested that the section number assigned to a law bears upon its
meaning. Cf. Scalia, *supra,*at xi-xvi (listing more than 50
interpretive principles and canons without mentioning the plurality\'s
new number-in-the-Code theory). And even on its own terms, the
plurality\'s argument is hard to fathom. The plurality claims that if §
1519applied to objects generally, Congress would not have placed it
\"after the pre-existing § 1516, § 1517, and § 1518\" because those are
\"specialized provisions.\" *Ante,*at 1084. But search me if I can find
a better place for a broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plurality
seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter 73-the criminal
code\'s chapter on \"obstruction of justice.\" But the provision does
not logically fit into any of that chapter\'s pre-existing sections. And
with the first 18 numbers of the chapter already taken (starting with §
1501 and continuing through § 1518), the law naturally took the 19th
place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was ordered chronologically: Section 1518
was later enacted than § 1517, which was later enacted than § 1516,
which was \... well, you get the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley,
Congress has continued in the same vein. Section 1519is thus right where
you would expect it (as is the contemporaneously passed § 1520)-between
§ 1518 (added in 1996) and § 1521 (added in 2008).[^11]

The plurality\'s third argument, relying on the surplusage canon, at
least invokes a known tool of statutory construction-but it too comes to
nothing. Says the plurality: If read naturally, § 1519\"would render
superfluous\" § 1512(c)(1), which Congress passed \"as part of the same
act.\" *Ante,*at 1085. But that is not so: Although the two provisions
significantly overlap, each applies to conduct the other does not. The
key difference between the two is that § 1519protects the integrity of
\"matter \[s\] within the jurisdiction of any \[federal\] department or
agency\" whereas § 1512(c)(1)safeguards \"official proceeding\[s\]\" as
defined in § 1515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519\'s language often applies more
broadly than § 1512(c)(1)\'s, as the plurality notes. For example, an
FBI investigation counts as a matter within a federal department\'s
jurisdiction, but falls outside the statutory definition of \"official
proceeding\" as construed by courts. See, *e.g.,United States v.
Gabriel,*125 F.3d 89, 105, n. 13 (C.A.2 1997). But conversely, §
1512(c)(1)sometimes reaches more widely than § 1519. For example,
because an \"official proceeding\" includes any \"proceeding before a
judge or court of the United States,\" § 1512(c)(1)prohibits tampering
with evidence in federal litigation between private parties. See §
1515(a)(1)(A); *United States v. Burge,*711 F.3d 803, 808-810 (C.A.7
2013); *United States v. Reich,*479 F.3d 179, 185-187 (C.A.2
2007)(SOTOMAYOR, J.). By contrast, § 1519wouldn\'t ordinarily operate in
that context because a federal court isn\'t a \"department or agency.\"
See *Hubbard v. United States,*514 U.S. 695, 715, 115 S.Ct. 1754, 131
L.Ed.2d 779 (1995).[^12]So the surplusage canon doesn\'t come into
play.[^13]Overlap-even significant overlap-abounds in the criminal law.
See *Loughrin v. United States,*573 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\-- - \-\-\--, n.
4, 134 S.Ct. 2384, 2390-2391, n. 4, 189 L.Ed.2d 411 (2014). This Court
has never thought that of such ordinary stuff surplusage is made. See
*ibid.*;*Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,*503 U.S. 249, 253, 112 S.Ct.
1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).

And the legislative history to which the plurality appeals, see
*ante,*at 1081, only cuts against it because those materials show that
lawmakers knew that § 1519and § 1512(c)(1)share much common ground.
Minority Leader Lott introduced the amendment that included §
1512(c)(1)(along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions)
late in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at the
specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12509, 12512
(2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott but several other Senators
noted the overlap between the President\'s package and provisions
already in the bill, most notably § 1519. See *id.,*at 12512 (remarks of
Sen. Lott); *id.,*at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden); *id.,*at 12517
(remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm). The presence of both § 1519 and §
1512(c)(1) in the final Act may have reflected belt-and-suspenders
caution: If § 1519contained some flaw, § 1512(c)(1)would serve as a
backstop. Or the addition of § 1512(c)(1)may have derived solely from
legislators\' wish \"to satisfy audiences other than courts\"-that is,
the President and his Justice Department. Gluck & Bressman, Statutory
Interpretation from the Inside, 65 Stan. L.Rev. 901, 935 (2013)(emphasis
deleted). Whichever the case, Congress\'s consciousness of overlap
between the two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast aside
§ 1519\'s ordinary meaning in service of preventing some statutory
repetition.

Indeed, the inclusion of § 1512(c)(1)in Sarbanes-Oxley creates a far
worse problem for the plurality\'s construction of § 1519than for mine.
Section 1512(c)(1)criminalizes the destruction of any \"record,
document, or other object\"; § 1519of any \"record, document, or
tangible object.\" On the plurality\'s view, one \"object\" is really an
object, whereas the other is only an object that preserves or stores
information. But \"\[t\]he normal rule of statutory construction assumes
that identical words used in different parts of the same act,\" passed
at the same time, \"are intended to have the same meaning.\" *Sorenson
v.*

*Secretary of Treasury,*475 U.S. 851, 860, 106 S.Ct. 1600, 89 L.Ed.2d
855 (1986)(internal quotation marks omitted). And that is especially
true when the different provisions pertain to the same subject. See
*supra,*at 1083. The plurality doesn\'t-really, can\'t-explain why it
instead interprets the same words used in two provisions of the same Act
addressing the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different
things.

Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches canons, hoping
that *noscitur a sociis*and *ejusdem generis* will save it. See *ante,*
at 1085 - 1087; see also*ante,*at 1089 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The first
of those related canons advises that words grouped in a list be given
similar meanings. The second counsels that a general term following
specific words embraces only things of a similar kind. According to the
plurality, those Latin maxims change the English meaning of \"tangible
object\" to only things, like records and documents, \"used to record or
preserve information.\" *Ante,*at 1085.[^14]But understood as this Court
always has, the canons have no such transformative effect on the
workaday language Congress chose.

As an initial matter, this Court uses *noscitur a sociis*and *ejusdem
generis* to resolve ambiguity, not create it. Those principles are
\"useful rule\[s\] of construction where words are of obscure or
doubtful meaning.\" *Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States,*261 U.S.
514, 520, 58 Ct.Cl. 708, 43 S.Ct. 428, 67 L.Ed. 778 (1923). But when
words have a clear definition, and all other contextual clues support
that meaning, the canons cannot properly defeat Congress\'s decision to
draft broad legislation. See, *e.g.,* *Ali,*552 U.S., at 227, 128 S.Ct.
831(rejecting the invocation of these canons as an \"attempt to create
ambiguity where the statute\'s text and structure suggest none\").

Anyway, assigning \"tangible object\" its ordinary meaning comports with
*noscitur a sociis* and *ejusdem generis* when applied, as they should
be, with attention to § 1519\'s subject and purpose. Those canons
require identifying a common trait that links all the words in a
statutory phrase. See, *e.g.,* *Graham County Soil and Water
Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,*559 U.S. 280, 289,
n. 7, 130 S.Ct. 1396, 176 L.Ed.2d 225 (2010); *Ali,* 552 U.S., at
224-226, 128 S.Ct. 831. In responding to that demand, the plurality
characterizes records and documents as things that preserve
information-and so they are. But just as much, they are things that
provide information, and thus potentially serve as evidence relevant to
matters under review. And in a statute pertaining to obstruction of
federal investigations, that evidentiary function comes to the fore. The
destruction of records and documents prevents law enforcement agents
from gathering facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the
destruction of tangible objects-of whatever kind. Whether the item is a
fisherman\'s ledger or an undersized fish, throwing it overboard has the
identical effect on the administration of justice. See *supra,*at 1094.
For purposes of § 1519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects
are therefore alike.

Indeed, even the plurality can\'t fully credit its *noscitur*/*ejusdem*
argument. The same reasoning would apply to *every* law placing the word
\"object\" (or \"thing\") after \"record\" and \"document.\" But as
noted earlier, such statutes are common: The phrase appears (among other
places) in many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as well as in
multiple provisions of § 1512. See *supra,*at 1092 - 1093. The plurality
accepts that in those laws \"object\" means object; its argument about
superfluity positively *depends*on giving § 1512(c)(1)that broader
reading. See *ante,* at 1085, 1087. What, then, is the difference here?
The plurality proposes that some of those statutes describe less serious
offenses than § 1519. See *ante,*at 1087. How and why that distinction
affects application of the *noscitur a sociis*and *ejusdem
generis*canons is left obscure: Count it as one more of the plurality\'s
never-before-propounded, not-readily-explained interpretive theories.
See *supra,*at 1094, 1094 - 1095, 1096 - 1097. But in any event, that
rationale cannot support the plurality\'s willingness to give \"object\"
its natural meaning in § 1512, which (like § 1519) sets out felonies
with penalties of up to 20 years. See §§ 1512(a)(3)(C), (b), (c). The
canons, in the plurality\'s interpretive world, apparently switch on and
off whenever convenient.

And the plurality\'s invocation of § 1519\'s verbs does nothing to
buttress its canon-based argument. See *ante,*at 1085 - 1086;*ante,*at
1089 - 1090 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The plurality observes that §
1519prohibits \"falsif\[ying\]\" or \"mak\[ing\] a false entry in\" a
tangible object, and no one can do those things to, say, a murder weapon
(or a fish). *Ante,*at 1085. But of course someone can alter, destroy,
mutilate, conceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and §
1519prohibits those actions too. The Court has never before suggested
that all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all the nouns. See
*Robers v. United States,*572 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\--, 134 S.Ct. 1854,
1858, 188 L.Ed.2d 885 (2014)(\"\[T\]he law does not require legislators
to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase,
applications in respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed\").
And for good reason. It is exactly when Congress sets out to draft a
statute broadly-to include every imaginable variation on a theme-that
such mismatches will arise. To respond by narrowing the law, as the
plurality does, is thus to flout both what Congress wrote and what
Congress wanted.

Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the rule of lenity.
See *ante,*at 1087. But even in its most robust form, that rule only
kicks in when, \"after all legitimate tools of interpretation have been
exhausted, \'a reasonable doubt persists\' regarding whether Congress
has made the defendant\'s conduct a federal crime.\" *Abramski v. United
States,*573 U.S. \-\-\--, \-\-\--, 134 S.Ct. 2259, 2281, 189 L.Ed.2d 262
(2014)(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (quoting *Moskal v. United States,*498
U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990)). No such doubt
lingers here. The plurality points to the breadth of § 1519, see
*ante,*at 1087, as though breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is
not. Section 1519*is* very broad. It is also very clear. Every
traditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the same
direction, toward \"object\" meaning object. Lenity offers no proper
refuge from that straightforward (even though capacious)
construction.[^15]

B

The concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of the plurality\'s.
It relies primarily on the *noscitur a sociis*and *ejusdem
generis*canons, tries to bolster them with § 1519\'s \"list of verbs,\"
and concludes with the section\'s title. See *supra,*at 1094, 1097 -
1098, 1098 (addressing each of those arguments). (Notably, even the
concurrence puts no stock in the plurality\'s section-number and
superfluity claims.) From those familiar materials, the concurrence
arrives at the following definition: \" \'tangible object\' should mean
something similar to records or documents.\" *Ante,*at 1090 (opinion of
ALITO, J.). In amplifying that purported guidance, the concurrence
suggests applying the term \"tangible object\" in keeping with what \"a
neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to record or
document,\" might answer. *Ante,*at 1089. \"\[W\]ho wouldn\'t raise an
eyebrow,\" the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said \"crocodile\"?
*Ante,*at 1089. Courts sometimes say, when explaining the Latin maxims,
that the \"words of a statute should be interpreted consistent with
their neighbors.\" See, *e.g.,United States v. Locke,* 529 U.S. 89, 105,
120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000). The concurrence takes that
expression literally.

But § 1519\'s meaning should not hinge on the odd game of Mad Libs the
concurrence proposes. No one reading § 1519needs to fill in a blank
after the words \"records\" and \"documents.\" That is because Congress,
quite helpfully, already did so-adding the term \"tangible object.\" The
issue in this case is what that term means. So if the concurrence wishes
to ask its neighbor a question, I\'d recommend a more pertinent one: Do
you think a fish (or, if the concurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a
\"tangible object\"? As to that query, \"who wouldn\'t raise an
eyebrow\" if the neighbor said \"no\"?

In insisting on its different question, the concurrence neglects the
proper function of catchall phrases like \"or tangible object.\" The
reason Congress uses such terms is precisely to reach things that, in
the concurrence\'s words, \"do\[ \] not spring to mind\"-to my mind, to
my neighbor\'s, or (most important) to Congress\'s. *Ante,*at 1089
(opinion of ALITO, J.). As this Court recently explained: \"\[T\]he
whole value of a generally phrased residual \[term\] is that it serves
as a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated-known
unknowns.\" *Beaty,*556 U.S., at 860, 129 S.Ct. 2183. Congress realizes
that in a game of free association with \"record\" and \"document,\" it
will never think of all the other things-including crocodiles and
fish-whose destruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as
effectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf. *United States v. Stubbs,*11
F.3d 632, 637-638 (C.A.6 1993)(dead crocodiles used as evidence to
support smuggling conviction). And so Congress adds the general term
\"or tangible object\"-again, exactly because such things \"do\[ \] not
spring to mind.\"[^16]

The concurrence suggests that the term \"tangible object\" serves not as
a catchall for physical evidence but to \"ensure beyond question\" that
e-mails and other electronic files fall within § 1519\'s compass.
*Ante,*at 1089. But that claim is eyebrow-raising in its own right.
Would a Congress wishing to make certain that § 1519applies to e-mails
add the phrase \"tangible object\" (as opposed, say, to \"electronic
communications\")? Would a judge or jury member predictably find that
\"tangible object\" encompasses something as virtual as e-mail (as
compared, say, with something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer
is not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for e-mails.

The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its arguments can carry the
day; rather, it takes the Latin canons plus § 1519\'s verbs plus §
1519\'s title to \"tip the case\" for Yates. *Ante,*at 1089. But the sum
total of three mistaken arguments is \... three mistaken arguments. They
do not get better in the combining. And so the concurrence ends up right
where the plurality does, except that the concurrence, eschewing the
rule of lenity, has nothing to fall back on.

III

If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation can produce
today\'s result, then what accounts for it? The plurality offers a clue
when it emphasizes the disproportionate penalties § 1519imposes if the
law is read broadly. See*ante,*at 1087 - 1088. Section 1519, the
plurality objects, would then \"expose\[ \] individuals to 20-year
prison sentences for tampering with *any* physical object that *might*
have evidentiary value in *any*federal investigation into *any*
offense.\" *Ante,*at 1088. That brings to the surface the real issue:
overcriminalization and excessive punishment in the U.S. Code.

Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat-though only
somewhat-exaggerates the matter. The plurality omits from its
description of § 1519the requirement that a person act \"knowingly\" and
with \"the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence\" federal law
enforcement. And in highlighting § 1519\'s maximum penalty, the
plurality glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum. (Let\'s
not forget that Yates\'s sentence was not 20 years, but 30 days.)
Congress presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no minimums when
it thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut from major to minor.
That is assuredly true of acts obstructing justice. Compare this case
with the following, all of which properly come within, but now fall
outside, § 1519: *McRae,*702 F.3d, at 834-838(burning human body to
thwart murder investigation); *Maury,*695 F.3d, at 243-244(altering
cement mixer to impede inquiry into amputation of employee\'s fingers);
*United States v. Natal,*2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108852, \*24-\*26
(D.Conn., Aug. 7, 2014) (repainting van to cover up evidence of fatal
arson). Most district judges, as Congress knows, will recognize
differences between such cases and prosecutions like this one, and will
try to make the punishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to
think, for the reasons the plurality gives, that § 1519is a bad law-too
broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum penalties, which give
prosecutors too much leverage and sentencers too much discretion. And
I\'d go further: In those ways, § 1519is unfortunately not an outlier,
but an emblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code.

But whatever the wisdom or folly of § 1519, this Court does not get to
rewrite the law. \"Resolution of the pros and cons of whether a statute
should sweep broadly or narrowly is for Congress.\" *Rodgers,*466 U.S.,
at 484, 104 S.Ct. 1942. If judges disagree with Congress\'s choice, we
are perfectly entitled to say so-in lectures, in law review articles,
and even in dicta. But we are not entitled to replace the statute
Congress enacted with an alternative of our own design.

I respectfully dissent.

conduct is all that is required for commission of a particular offense,
or if an offense or some material element thereof does not require a
culpable mental state on the part of the actor, such offense is one of
\"strict liability.\" If a culpable mental state on the part of the
actor is required with respect to every material element of an offense,
such offense is one of \"mental culpability.\"

SIMPSON, Judge.

Appellant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway, and appeals.
Officers of the law arrested him at his home and took him onto the
highway, where he allegedly committed the proscribed acts, viz.,
manifested a drunken condition by using loud and profane language.

The pertinent provisions of our statute are: "Any person who, while
intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more
persons are present, \* \* \* and manifests a drunken condition by
boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on
conviction, be fined", etc. Code 1940, Title 14, Section 120.

Under the plain terms of this statute, a voluntary appearance is
presupposed. The rule has been declared, and we think it sound, that an
accusation of drunkenness in a designated public place cannot be
established by proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated
condition, was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the
arresting officer. **\[ ... \]**

Conviction of appellant was contrary to this announced principle and, in
our view, erroneous. It appears that no legal conviction can be
sustained under the evidence, so, consonant with the prevai1ing rule,
the judgment of the trial court is reversed and one here rendered
discharging appellant. **\[ ... \]**

The People of the State of New York, Plaintiff,\
v.\
Eileen Shaughnessy, Defendant.

District Court of Nassau County, Third District, Trial Term.

March 16, 1971

*John P. Cleary* for plaintiff. *Martin S. Cole* for defendant.

## JOHN S. LOCKMAN, J.

On October 9, 1970, shortly before 10:05 P.M., the defendant in the
company of her boyfriend and two other youngsters proceeded by
automobile to the vicinity of the St. Ignatius Retreat Home, Searingtown
Road, Incorporated Village of North Hills, Nassau County, New York. The
defendant was a passenger and understood that she was headed for the
Christopher Morley Park which is located across the street from the St.
Ignatius Retreat Home and has a large illuminated sign, with letters
approximately 8 inches high, which identifies the park. As indicated, on
the other side of the street the St. Ignatius Retreat Home has two
pillars at its entrance with a bronze sign on each pillar with 4- to
5-inch letters. The sign is not illuminated. The vehicle in which the
defendant was riding proceeded into the grounds of the retreat house and
was stopped by a watchman, and the occupants including the defendant
waited approximately 20 minutes for a policeman to arrive. The defendant
never left the automobile.

The defendant is charged with violating section 1 of the ordinance
prohibiting entry upon private property in the Incorporated Village of
North Hills, which provides: \"No person shall enter upon any privately
owned piece, parcel or lot of real property in the Village of North
Hills without the permission of the owner, lessee or occupant thereof.
The failure of the person, so entering upon, or found to be on, such
private property, to produce upon demand, the written permission of the
owner, lessee or occupant to enter upon, or to be on, such real
property, shall be and shall constitute presumptive evidence of the
violation of this ordinance.\"

The defendant at the conclusion of the trial moves to dismiss on the
grounds that the statute is unconstitutional. Since the ordinance is
*malum prohibtum*, in all likelihood the ordinance is constitutional.

rel. Travis v. Thatcher*, 190 Misc. 494.)

However, it is unnecessary to pass upon the constitutionality of the
ordinance since there is another basis for dismissal.

The problem presented by the facts in this case brings up for review the
primary elements that are required for criminal accountability and
responsibility. It is only from an accused\'s voluntary overt acts that
criminal responsibility can attach. An overt act or a specific omission
to act must occur in order for the establishment of a criminal offense.
(*People v. Walrath*, 279 App. Div. 56; Marks and Paperno, Criminal Law
in New York, Under the Revised Penal Law, ch. 4, § 24, p. 44; Clark and
Marshall Crimes, ch. 4, § 4.00.)

The physical element required has been designated as the *actus reus.*
The mental element is of course better known as the *mens rea.* While
the mental element may under certain circumstances not be required as in
crimes that are designated as *malum prohibitum*, the *actus reus* is
always necessary. It certainly cannot be held to be the intent of the
Legislature to punish involuntary acts. (*Hornstein v. Paramount
Pictures*, 22 Misc 2d 996, affd. 266 App. Div. 659, affd. 292 N.Y. 468;
*Louisville Ry. Co. v. Commonwealth*, 130 Ky. 738, 742; 16 C. J. S.,
Constitutional Law, pp. 76-78; 22 C. J. S., Criminal Law, § 30.)

The principle which requires a voluntary act or omission to act had been
codified in section 15.10 of the revised Penal Law, and reads as follows
in part: \"The minimal requirement for criminal liability is the
performance by a person of conduct which includes a *voluntary act or
the omission to perform an act* which he is physically capable of
performing\" (italics supplied).

The Legislature may prescribe that an act is criminal without regard to
the doer\'s intent or knowledge, but an involuntary act is not criminal
(with certain exceptions such as involuntary acts resulting from
voluntary intoxication).

In the case at bar, the People have failed to establish any act on the
part of the defendant. She merely was a passenger in a vehicle. Any
action taken by the vehicle was caused and guided by the driver thereof
and not by the defendant. If the defendant were to be held guilty under
these circumstances, it would dictate that she would be guilty if she
had been unconscious or asleep at the time or even if she had been a
prisoner in the automobile. There are many situations which can be
envisioned and in which the trespass statute in question would be
improperly applied to an involuntary act. One might conceive **\[ ...
\]** of a driver losing control of a vehicle through mechanical failure
and the vehicle proceeding onto private property which is the subject of
a trespass.

Although the court need not pass on the question, it might very well be
proper to hold the driver responsible for his act even though he was
under the mistaken belief that he was on his way to Christopher Morley
Park. The Legislature has provided statutes which make mistakes of fact
or lack of knowledge no excuse in a criminal action. However, if the
driver had been a defendant, the People could have established an act on
the part of the defendant driver, to wit, turning his vehicle into the
private property.

In the case of the defendant now before the court, however, the very
first and essential element in criminal responsibility is missing, an
overt voluntary act or omission to act and, accordingly, the defendant
is found not guilty.

People v. Decina

 

New York Court of Appeals

2 N.Y.2d 133

1956-11-29

**\[ ... \]**

FROESSEL, J.

At about 3:30 P.M. on March 14, 1955, a bright, sunny day, defendant was
driving, alone in his car, in a northerly direction on Delaware Avenue
in the city of Buffalo. **\[ ... \]**At a point south of an overhead
viaduct of the Erie Railroad, defendant\'s car swerved to the left,
across the center line in the street, so that it was completely in the
south lane, traveling 35 to 40 miles per hour.

It then veered sharply to the right, crossing Delaware Avenue and
mounting the easterly curb at a point beneath the viaduct and continued
thereafter at a speed estimated to have been about 50 or 60 miles per
hour or more. **\[ ... \]**

A group of six schoolgirls were walking north on the easterly sidewalk
of Delaware Avenue, two in front and four slightly in the rear, when
defendant\'s car struck them from behind. One of the girls escaped
injury by jumping against the wall of the viaduct. **\[ ... \]** Three
of the children, 6 to 12 years old, were found dead on arrival by the
medical examiner, and a fourth child, 7 years old, died in a hospital
two days later as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.

After striking the children, defendant\'s car continued on the easterly
sidewalk, and then swerved back onto Delaware Avenue once more. It
continued in a northerly direction**\[ ... \]**until it finally crashed
through a 7¼-inch brick wall of a grocery store, injuring at least one
customer and causing considerable property damage.

**\[ ... \]**Defendant was stooped over in the car and was \"bobbing a
little\". To one witness he appeared dazed, to another unconscious,
lying back with his hands off the wheel. Various people present shouted
to defendant to turn off the ignition of his car, and \"within a matter
of seconds the horn stopped blowing and the car did shut off\".

Defendant was pulled out of the car **\[ ... \]** and laid down on the
sidewalk. To a policeman who came on the scene shortly he appeared
\"injured, dazed\"; another witness said that \"he looked as though he
was knocked out, and his arm seemed to be bleeding\". An injured
customer in the store, after receiving first aid, pressed defendant for
an explanation of the accident and he told her: \"I blacked out from the
bridge\".

**\[ ... \]**

*\[At the hospital, Decina,\]* who still felt a little dizzy or blurry,
said that as he was driving he noticed a jerking of his right hand,
which warned him that he might develop a convulsion, and that as he
tried to steer the car over to the curb he felt himself becoming
unconscious, and he thought he had a convulsion. He was aware that
children were in front of his car, but did not know whether he had
struck them.

Defendant then proceeded to relate to Dr. Wechter his past medical
history,**\[ ... \]**In 1946 he was treated in this same hospital for an
illness during which he had some convulsions. Several burr holes were
made in his skull and a brain abscess was drained. Following this
operation defendant had no convulsions from 1946 through 1950. In 1950
he had four convulsions, caused by scar tissue on the brain. From 1950
to 1954 he experienced about 10 or 20 seizures a year, in which his
right hand would jump although he remained fully conscious. In 1954, he
had 4 or 5 generalized seizures with loss of consciousness, the last
being in September, 1954, a few months before the accident. Thereafter
he had more hospitalization, a spinal tap, consultation with a
neurologist, and took medication daily to help prevent seizures.

On the basis of this medical history, Dr. Wechter made a diagnosis of
Jacksonian epilepsy, and was of the opinion that defendant had a seizure
at the time of the accident. **\[ ... \]**

Defendant was indicted and charged with violating section 1053-a of the
Penal Law[^17]. *\[See concurrence, below, for the relevant text of the
statute.\]*

We turn first to the subject of defendant\'s cross appeal, namely, that
**\[ ... \]**the *indictment* here does not charge a crime. The
indictment states essentially that defendant, *knowing* \"that he was
subject to epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to
lose consciousness for a considerable period of time\", was culpably
negligent \"in that he *consciously* undertook to and *did operate* his
Buick sedan on a public highway\" (emphasis supplied) and \"while so
doing\" suffered such an attack which caused said automobile \"to travel
at a fast and reckless rate of speed, jumping the curb and driving over
the sidewalk\" causing the death of 4 persons. In our opinion, this
clearly states a violation of section 1053-a of the Penal Law. The
statute does not require that a defendant must deliberately intend to
kill a human being, for that would be murder. Nor does the statute
require that he knowingly and consciously follow the precise path that
leads to death and destruction. It is sufficient, we have said, when his
conduct manifests a \"disregard of the consequences which may ensue from
the act, and indifference to the rights of others. No clearer
definition, applicable to the hundreds of varying circumstances that may
arise, can be given. Under a given state of facts, whether negligence is
culpable is a question of judgment.\" **\[ ... \]**

Assuming the truth of the indictment, as we must on a demurrer, this
defendant knew he was subject to epileptic**\[ ... \]**attacks and
seizures that might strike *at any time*. He also knew that a moving
motor vehicle uncontrolled on a public highway is a highly dangerous
instrumentality capable of unrestrained destruction. With this
*knowledge*, and without anyone accompanying him, he deliberately took a
chance by making a conscious choice of a course of action, in disregard
of the consequences which he knew might follow from his conscious act,
and which in this case did ensue. How can we say as a matter of law that
this did not amount to culpable negligence within the meaning of section
1053-a?

To hold otherwise would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself
in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if
it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and
reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or
involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution under
the statute. His awareness of a condition which he knows may produce
such consequences as here, and his disregard of the consequences,
renders him liable for culpable negligence, as the courts below have
properly held **\[ ... \]**. To have a sudden sleeping spell, an
unexpected heart or other disabling attack, without any prior knowledge
or warning thereof, is an altogether different situation**\[ ... \]**,
and there is simply no basis for comparing such cases with the flagrant
disregard manifested here.

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed[^18].

**\[ ... \]**DESMOND, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

I agree that the judgment of conviction cannot stand but I think the
indictment should be dismissed because it alleges no crime. Defendant\'s
demurrer should have been sustained.

The indictment charges that defendant knowing that \"he was subject to
epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to lose
consciousness\" suffered \"an attack and loss of consciousness which
caused the said automobile operated by the said defendant to travel at a
fast and reckless rate of speed\" and to jump a curb and run onto the
sidewalk \"thereby striking and causing the death\" of 4 children.
Horrible as this occurrence was and whatever necessity it may show for
new licensing and driving laws, nevertheless this indictment charges no
crime known to the New York statutes. Our duty is to dismiss it.

Section 1053-a of the Penal Law describes the crime of \"criminal
negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death\". Declared
to be guilty of that crime is \"A person who operates or drives any
vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby
a human being is killed\". The essentials of the crime are, therefore,
first, vehicle *operation* in a culpably negligent *manner*, and,
second, the resulting death of a person.**\[ ... \]**No *operation* of
an automobile in a reckless manner is charged against defendant. The
excessive speed of the car and its jumping the curb were \"caused\",
says the indictment itself, by defendant\'s prior \"attack and loss of
consciousness\". Therefore, what defendant is accused of is *not*
reckless or culpably negligent driving, which necessarily connotes and
involves consciousness and volition. The fatal assault by this car was
after and because of defendant\'s failure of consciousness. To say that
one drove a car in a reckless manner in that his unconscious condition
caused the car to travel recklessly is to make two mutually
contradictory assertions. One cannot be \"reckless\" while unconscious.
One cannot while unconscious**\[ ... \]**\"operate\" a car in a culpably
negligent manner or in any other \"manner\". The statute makes criminal
a particular kind of knowing, voluntary, immediate operation.**\[ ...
\]**

**\[ ... \]**

Numerous are the diseases and other conditions of a human being which
make it possible or even likely that the afflicted person will lose
control of his automobile. Epilepsy, coronary involvements, circulatory
diseases, nephritis, uremic poisoning, diabetes, Meniere\'s syndrome, a
tendency to fits of sneezing, locking of the knee, muscular contractions
--- any of these common conditions may cause loss of control of a
vehicle for a period long enough to cause a fatal accident. An
automobile traveling at only 30 miles an hour goes 44 feet in a second.
Just what is the court holding here? No less than**\[ ... \]**this: that
a driver whose brief blackout lets his car run amuck and kill another
has killed that other by reckless driving. But any such \"recklessness\"
consists necessarily not of the erratic behavior of the automobile while
its driver is unconscious, but of his driving at all when he knew he was
subject to such attacks. Thus, it must be that such a blackout-prone
driver is guilty of reckless driving**\[ ... \]**whenever and as soon as
he steps into the driver\'s seat of a vehicle. Every time he drives,
accident or no accident, he is subject to criminal prosecution for
reckless driving or to revocation of his operator\'s license**\[ ...
\]**. And how many of this State\'s 5,000,000 licensed operators are
subject to such penalties for merely driving the cars they are licensed
to drive? No one knows **\[ ... \]**. It is no answer that prosecutors
and juries will be reasonable or compassionate. A criminal statute whose
reach is so unpredictable violates constitutional rights**\[ ... \]**.

894 N.Y.S.2d 266

## THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, Respondent, v. CARL D. ERB, JR., Appellant.

Not in source.

Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, Fourth Department.

Decided February 11, 2010.

## Present---Smith, J.P., Carni, Pine and Gorski, JJ.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
reversed on the law, the indictment is dismissed, and the matter is
remitted to Ontario County Court for proceedings pursuant to CPL 470.45.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him upon a jury verdict
of criminally negligent homicide (Penal Law § 125.10), defendant
contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the
conviction. We agree. The evidence establishes that defendant and the
victim, whom he first met on the day she died, used cocaine throughout
that day. While defendant was driving the victim to her mother\'s home
in a trailer park, he observed her inject herself with heroin, which she
had obtained without his assistance. Upon arriving at the trailer park,
defendant was unable to wake the victim in order to ascertain her
mother\'s address within the trailer park, at which time he removed her
from his vehicle and left her on a lawn inside the trailer park.
Although the victim was breathing and making noises at the time
defendant left her there, she was found unconscious several hours later
and died within a short time after being hospitalized.

Defendant was acquitted of manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law
§ 125.15 \[1\]) but convicted of the lesser included offense of
criminally negligent homicide. \"The question on this appeal is
therefore whether, when viewed in the light most favorable to the
People, the evidence adduced at trial showed that \[defendant\'s\]
conduct constituted \`not only a failure \[1381\] to perceive a risk of
death, but also some serious blameworthiness in the conduct that caused
it\' . . . Measured by this standard, the evidence falls short\"
(*People v Cabrera,* 10 NY3d 370, 378 \[2008\], quoting *People v
Boutin,* 75 NY2d 692, 696 \[1990\]). We agree with defendant that the
evidence failed to establish that his acts in any way caused the death
of the victim. Defendant did not procure or inject the drugs that caused
the death of the victim, nor did he place her in a location that made
her less likely to obtain medical assistance. There is no evidence that
removing the victim from the vehicle or leaving her outside contributed
to her death. Consequently, \"defendant\'s actions were not a
\`*sufficiently direct cause*\' of \[the victim\'s\] death to warrant
the imposition of criminal liability\" (*People v Bianco,* 67 AD3d 1417,
1419 \[2009\], quoting *People v Kibbe,* 35 NY2d 407, 413 \[1974\]).

Further, although \"\[t\]he Penal Law provides that criminal liability
may be based on an omission . . . , which is defined as the failure to
perform a legally imposed duty\" (*People v Steinberg,* 79 NY2d 673, 680
\[1992\]; *see* Penal Law § 15.00 \[3\]; § 15.05), no such omission
occurred here. \"Criminal liability cannot be premised on a failure to
act . . . , unless the party so charged has a legal duty to act\"
(*People v Myers,* 201 AD2d 855, 856 \[1994\]; *see* *People v Carroll,*
244 AD2d 104, 106 \[1998\], *affd* 93 NY2d 564 \[1999\]). Inasmuch as
the People do not contend that defendant had any duty to provide care
for the victim and, indeed, they presented no evidence of such a duty
(*see* *Myers,* 201 AD2d 855, 856-857 \[1994\]; *cf.* *People v Manon,*
226 AD2d 774, 776 \[1996\], *lv denied* 88 NY2d 1022 \[1996\]), there is
no basis upon which to find defendant liable for a failure to act. We
therefore reverse the judgment of conviction, dismiss the indictment,
and remit the matter to County Court for proceedings pursuant to CPL
470.45.

We need not review defendant\'s remaining contentions in light of our
determination.

People v. Sanford

 

4 Misc.3d 180 (2004)\
777 N.Y.S.2d 595

## THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, Plaintiff, v. PAULA SANFORD, Defendant.

Supreme Court, Kings County.

April 28, 2004.

*Renfroe & Quinn,* Forest Hills (*Christopher Renfroe* of counsel), for
defendant.

*Charles J. Hynes, District Attorney,* Brooklyn (*Arlene Markarian* of
counsel), for plaintiff.

## OPINION OF THE COURT

## MATTHEW D\'EMIC, J.

## \[181\] Procedure

Defendant is charged with manslaughter in the second degree, criminally
negligent homicide, reckless endangerment in the first degree, reckless
endangerment in the second degree, and assault in the third degree. The
charges stem from the death of defendant\'s mother, Clarise Gray, on
September 16, 2003. Defendant moves to dismiss the indictment pursuant
to Criminal Procedure Law § 210.20 (1) (b) in that the evidence
presented to the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the
offenses charged or any lesser included offense.

## Evidence Before Grand Jury

In this case, the evidence before the grand jury consisted of the
medical examiner\'s testimony that Ms. Gray died of blunt impact
injuries to the torso consistent with a fall down a flight of stairs and
the testimony of the investigating detective as to a statement made to
him by Ms. Sanford.

Ms. Sanford initially told the detective she arrived home to find her
mother unconscious. Several days later she changed her account, stating
that her mother began arguing and cursing at her as she fed her
mother\'s cat. Ms. Gray was wagging her finger at the defendant, who
grabbed at it. Ms. Gray pulled her hand away causing her to lose her
balance and fall down a flight of stairs. Defendant went down to help
her mother, but her mother, in a kneeling position, as if to get up,
told her daughter to leave her alone and get out. Defendant left to run
errands at about 3:00 p.m., returning five hours later to find her
mother dead at the bottom of the stairs. The time of death was estimated
at 4:00-5:00 p.m. Based on this evidence, the grand jury returned a true
bill on all counts.

Defendant\'s motion to dismiss this indictment must be denied if the
evidence presented to the grand jury, viewed most favorably to the
People, without benefit of explanation, contradiction or clarification,
would warrant conviction by a jury (*People v Galatro,* 84 NY2d 160
\[1994\]; *People v Jennings,* 69 NY2d 103 \[1986\]). Put another way,
if the evidence on its face establishes every element of the charged
offenses, the indictment must survive (*People v Smith,* 213 AD2d 1073
\[1995\]).

## Legal Analysis

In this case, both sides agree on the facts and that the only evidence
against the defendant is her statement to the police. The People contend
that by grabbing at her mother\'s finger at \[182\] the top of a
staircase she committed a criminally reckless act which was compounded
by her failure to render assistance. The defense contends that no
criminal liability can attach to the daughter\'s actions.

Under the definition of both recklessness and criminal negligence,
essential elements of the crimes charged in this indictment, there must
exist prima facie proof that Ms. Sanford perceived and ignored, or just
did not perceive \"a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that death or
injury would ensue from her conduct, and that such ignorance or
short-sightedness was grossly deviant (*see* Penal Law § 15.05 \[3\],
\[4\]).

In order for criminality to attach to the defendant\'s conduct in
grabbing her mother\'s finger and failing to get her help, it must be
found so transparently and substantially risky as to be utterly abnormal
when compared to ordinary behavior. For criminality cannot be imposed
unless the risk created and disregarded would be apparent to anyone who
shares the community\'s general sense of right and wrong (*People v
Ricardo B.,* 73 NY2d 228 \[1989\]).

In deciding whether a crime was committed, case law is instructive. The
Court of Appeals has narrowed the inquiry in cases of reckless
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, stating that some
culpable \"risk creation\" is essential. That is, unless a defendant
engages in blameworthy conduct creating a substantial risk of death, no
crime has occurred (*People v Boutin,* 75 NY2d 692 \[1990\]). Other
appellate courts have utilized this standard in making a legal
determination on the peculiar facts of each case. For example, in
*People v Graham* (122 AD2d 345 \[1986\]), forcefully throwing an
intoxicated victim out of a bar in close proximity to a flight of stairs
was found sufficient to create a substantial and unjustifiable risk of
death sustaining a finding of criminal negligence. On the other hand, in
*People v Erby* (97 AD2d 380 \[1983\]), the Court found that punching a
victim causing him to fall, hit his head and die was insufficient.
Likewise, in *People v Johnson* (131 AD2d 697 \[1987\]), where
roughhousing involving choking resulted in death. As the Court stated in
*People v Erby* (*supra*): \"That there was a risk is obvious from the
fact that a death occurred, but it was not \`of such a nature and
degree\' that a reasonable person would be under a duty to perceive
it.\"

Using these cases as a guide, the court finds even less culpability in
the case before it. There was no act of violence, nor was there an act
of patent indifference. Rather, this case involves a \[183\] not
uncommon dispute between relatives that escalated into a split-second
expression of frustration. It is clear that neither Ms. Sanford nor Ms.
Gray knew nor could be expected to know that their actions would cause
Ms. Gray to fall down the stairs. It is equally clear that both of their
actions contributed to the fall. Because of this, the court finds that
no criminality can attach to defendant\'s act of grabbing at her
mother\'s finger. The court also determines that no criminal liability
flows from her failure to seek medical assistance for her mother.

Again, the only evidence presented is defendant\'s statement that she
went down the stairs to help her mother and that she left her mother
getting up and yelling at her to get out. Defendant complied with her
mother\'s request, left to do chores and on her return discovered her
mother\'s body.

The defense argues that failing to aid is an omission which cannot
trigger criminal liability because a child owes no duty to a parent
(*see generally* Penal Law § 15.00 \[3\]). The People concede that a
child owes no duty to a parent, but contend that, having placed her
mother in peril, defendant then had a duty to aid.

It is true that there is generally no legal duty of care on the part of
an adult child to her infirm parents, and without a legal duty an
omission to act may not give rise to criminal liability (*People v
Myers,* 201 AD2d 855 \[1994\]; *People v Spadaccini,* 124 AD2d 859
\[1986\]). It is equally true, however, that creation of the peril
imposes a duty to seek assistance. However, before such a duty is
imposed, some finding of deplorable behavior must precede the failure to
act, such as shooting the victim and leaving him to die (*People v
Woodruff,* 4 AD3d 770 \[2004\]); supplying the cocaine that caused an
overdose (*State v Morgan,* 86 Wash App 74, 936 P2d 20 \[1997\]);
leaving a robbery victim in a cold and remote location (*United States v
Hatatley,* 130 F3d 1399 \[1997\]); and causing a fire and failing to
report it (*Commonwealth v Levesque,* 436 Mass 443, 766 NE2d 50
\[2002\]). In this case, the initial affirmative act was neither
intentional nor reckless. In addition, defendant did attempt to assist
her mother but was pointedly turned away, concealing Ms. Gray\'s true
level of distress.

In hindsight, it is clear that defendant should have persisted in her
effort to assist her mother. Ms. Sanford\'s leaving for five hours was a
mistake, causing the direst consequence. Yet, it was not criminal. For
behavior prescribed by humane considerations is not the subject of the
court\'s inquiry. It is the law and not \[184\] disapprobation that
governs. Every accident does not impose a legal duty to assist. As was
stated in *State ex rel. Kuntz v Montana Thirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct.* (298
Mont 146, 151, 995 P2d 951, 955 \[2000\]):

> \"For criminal liability to be based upon a failure to act, there must
> be a duty imposed by the law to act . . . This rule imposes no legal
> duty on a person to rescue or summon aid for another person who is at
> risk or is in danger, even though society recognizes that a moral
> obligation might exist. . . Thus, an Olympic swimmer may be deemed by
> the community as a shameful coward, or worse, for not rescuing a
> drowning child in the neighbor\'s pool, but she is not a criminal.\"
> (Citations omitted.)

Although no legal duty to act existed under the law, it is clear that
both the act and omission in this case constitute one event. Parsing the
unfortunate event into sequences of act and omission does nothing to
advance the legal analysis. Since no recklessness or criminal negligence
was involved in the act, the omission following immediately on its heels
cannot elevate it. Leaving her mother was unthinking, but not so grossly
apathetic as to rise to a criminal offense.

In the court\'s opinion, this event was a freak accident followed by a
most unfortunate lapse in judgment. It was not, however, a crime.

For the reasons stated, the indictment is dismissed.

Morissette v. United States

 

Supreme Court of the United States

**Morissette v. United States**

342 U.S. 246

**\[ ... \]**

No. 12

1952-01-07

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

**\[ ... \]**

On a large tract of uninhabited and untilled land in a wooded and
sparsely populated area of Michigan, the Government established a
practice bombing range over which the Air Force dropped simulated bombs
at ground targets. These bombs consisted of a metal cylinder about forty
inches long and eight inches across, filled with sand and enough black
powder to cause a smoke puff by which the strike could be located. At
various places about the range, signs read \"Danger \-- Keep Out \--
Bombing Range.\" Nevertheless, the range was known as good deer country,
and was extensively hunted.

Spent bomb casings were cleared from the targets and thrown into piles
\"so that they will be out of the way.\" They were not sacked or piled
in any order, but were dumped in heaps, some of which had been
accumulating for four years or upwards, were exposed to the weather and
rusting away.

Morissette, in December of 1948, went hunting in this area but did not
get a deer. He thought to meet expenses of the trip by salvaging some of
these casings. He loaded three tons of them on his truck and took them
to a nearby farm, where they were flattened by driving a tractor over
them. After expending this labor and trucking them to market in Flint,
he realized \$84.

**\[ ... \]**

He was indicted**\[ ... \]**on the charge that he \"did unlawfully,
wilfully and knowingly steal and convert\" property of the United States
of the value of \$84, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641, which provides
that \"whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts\"
government property is punishable by fine and imprisonment. \[Footnote
1\]. Morissette was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two
months or to pay a fine of \$200. The Court of Appeals affirmed, one
judge dissenting.

On his trial, Morissette, as he had at all times told investigating
officers, testified that, from appearances, he believed the casings were
cast-off and abandoned, that he did not intend to steal the property,
and took it with no wrongful or criminal intent. The trial court,
however, was unimpressed, and ruled: \"\[H\]e took it because he thought
it was abandoned and he knew he was on government property. . . . That
is no defense. . . . I don\'t think anybody can have the defense they
thought the property was abandoned on another man\'s piece of
property.\" The court stated: \"I will not permit you to show this man
thought it was abandoned. . . . I hold in this case that there is no
question of abandoned property.\" The court refused to submit or to
allow counsel to argue to the jury whether Morissette acted with
innocent intention. **\[ ... \]**The question on intent is whether or
not he intended to take the property. He says he did. Therefore, if you
believe either side, he is guilty.\" Petitioner\'s counsel contended,
\"But the taking must have been with a felonious intent.\" The court
ruled, however: \"That is presumed by his own act.\"

**\[ ... \]**

The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted
by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universal
and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the
human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to
choose between good and evil. A relation between some mental element and
punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the child\'s
familiar exculpatory \"But I didn\'t mean to,\" and has afforded the
rational basis for a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence and
reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as the motivation for
public prosecution. Unqualified acceptance of this doctrine by English
common law in the Eighteenth Century was indicated by Blackstone\'s
sweeping statement that to constitute any crime there must first be a
\"vicious will.\" Common law commentators of the Nineteenth Century
early pronounced the same principle, although a few exceptions not
relevant to our present problem came to be recognized.

Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from
concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand, was
congenial to an intense individualism and took deep and early root in
American soil. As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if
their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that
the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle, but merely
recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that
it required no statutory affirmation. Courts, with little hesitation or
division, found an implication of the requirement as to offenses that
were taken over from the common law. **\[ ... \]**

*The exception to the rule that crimes require some mens rea is found in
a* category of another character, with very different antecedents and
origins. The crimes there involved depend on no mental element, but
consist only of forbidden acts or omissions. This, while not expressed
by the Court, is made clear from examination of a century-old but
accelerating tendency, discernible both here and in England, to call
into existence new duties and crimes which disregard any ingredient of
intent. The industrial revolution multiplied the number of workmen
exposed to injury from increasingly powerful and complex mechanisms,
driven by freshly discovered sources of energy, requiring higher
precautions by employers. Traffic of velocities, volumes and varieties
unheard of came to subject the wayfarer to intolerable casualty risks if
owners and drivers were not to observe new cares and uniformities of
conduct. Congestion of cities and crowding of quarters called for health
and welfare regulations undreamed of in simpler times. Wide distribution
of goods became an instrument of wide distribution of harm when those
who dispersed food, drink, drugs, and even securities, did not comply
with reasonable standards of quality, integrity, disclosure and care.
Such dangers have engendered increasingly numerous and detailed
regulations which heighten the duties of those in control of particular
industries, trades, properties or activities that affect public health,
safety or welfare.

While many of these duties are sanctioned by a more strict civil
liability, lawmakers, whether wisely or not, have sought to make such
regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to be applied
by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and convictions. This
has confronted the courts with a multitude of prosecutions, based on
statutes or administrative regulations, for what have been aptly called
\"public welfare offenses.\" These cases do not fit neatly into any of
such accepted classifications of common law offenses, such as those
against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these
offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions,
with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of
neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a
duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or
immediate injury to person or property, but merely create the danger or
probability of it which the law seeks to minimize. While such offenses
do not threaten the security of the state in the manner of treason, they
may be regarded as offenses against its authority, for their occurrence
impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social order
as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the intent of the
violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or
not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such
offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary
element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a
position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably
expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who
assumed his responsibilities. Also, penalties commonly are relatively
small, and conviction does not grave damage to an offender\'s
reputation. Under such considerations, courts have turned to construing
statutes and regulations which make no mention of intent as dispensing
with it and holding that the guilty act alone makes out the crime. This
has not, however, been without expressions of misgiving.

**\[ ... \]**

The purpose and obvious effect of doing away with the requirement of a
guilty intent is to ease the prosecution\'s path to conviction, to strip
the defendant of such benefit as he derived at common law from innocence
of evil purpose, and to circumscribe the freedom heretofore allowed
juries. Such a manifest impairment of the immunities of the individual
should not be extended to common law crimes on judicial initiative.

The spirit of the doctrine which denies to the federal judiciary power
to create crimes forthrightly admonishes that we should not enlarge the
reach of enacted crimes by constituting them from anything less than the
incriminating components contemplated by the words used in the statute.
And where Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the
legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably
knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each
borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the
meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise
instructed. In such case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as
satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from
them.

**\[ ... \]**

The section with which we are here concerned was enacted in 1948, as a
consolidation of four former sections of Title 18, as adopted in 1940,
which, in turn, were derived from two sections of the Revised Statutes.
**\[ ... \]** Not one of these had been interpreted to be a crime
without intention, and no purpose to differentiate between them in the
matter of intent is disclosed.

**\[ ... \]**

Congress, by the language of this section, has been at pains to
incriminate only \"knowing\" conversions. **\[ ... \]**

Had the statute applied to conversions without qualification, it would
have made crimes of all unwitting, inadvertent and unintended
conversions. Knowledge, of course, is not identical with intent, and may
not have been the most apt words of limitation. But knowing
conversion requires more than knowledge that defendant was taking the
property into his possession. He must have had knowledge of the facts,
though not necessarily the law, that made the taking a conversion. **\[

We find no grounds for inferring any affirmative instruction from
Congress to eliminate intent from any offense with which this defendant
was charged.

Argued November 30, 1993

Justice Thomas

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The National Firearms Act makes it unlawful for any person to possess a
machinegun that is not properly registered with the Federal Government.
Petitioner contends that, to convict him under the Act, the Government
should have been required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he
knew the weapon he possessed had the characteristics that brought it
within the statutory definition of a machinegun. We agree and
accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I

The National Firearms Act (Act), 26 U. S. C. §§5801-5872, imposes strict
registration requirements on statutorily defined "firearms." The Act
includes within the term "firearm" a machinegun, § 5845(a)(6), and
further defines a machinegun as "any weapon which shoots,\... or can be
readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without
manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger," § 5845(b). Thus,
any fully automatic weapon is a "firearm" within the meaning of the
Act.[**\[ ... \]**](#X588946134d4befd94c23f8032a6023d102c20b1)Under the
Act, all firearms must be registered in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record maintained by the Secretary of the
Treasury. § 5841. Section 5861(d) makes it a crime, *punishable* by up
to 10 years in prison, see § 5871, for any person to possess a firearm
that is not properly registered.

Upon executing a search warrant at petitioner's home, local police and
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) recovered,
among other things, an AR-15 rifle. The AR-15 is the civilian version of
the military's M-16 rifle, and is, unless modified, a semiautomatic
weapon. The M-16, in contrast, is a selective fire rifle that allows the
operator, by rotating a selector switch, to choose semiautomatic or
automatic fire. Many M-16 parts are interchangeable with those in the
AR-15 and can be used to convert the AR-15 into an automatic weapon. No
doubt to inhibit such conversions, the AR-15 is manufactured with a
metal stop on its receiver that will prevent an M-16 selector switch, if
installed, from rotating to the fully automatic position. The metal stop
on petitioner's rifle, however, had been filed away, and the rifle had
been assembled with an M-16 selector switch and several other M-16
internal parts, including a hammer, disconnector, and trigger.
Suspecting that the AR-15 had been modified to be capable of fully
automatic fire, BATF agents seized the weapon. Petitioner subsequently
was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered machinegun in
violation of § 5861(d).

At trial, BATF agents testified that when the AR-15 was tested, it fired
more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger. It was undisputed
that the weapon was not registered as required by § 5861(d). Petitioner
testified that the rifle had never fired automatically when it was in
his possession. He insisted that the AR-15 had operated only
semiautomatically, and even then imperfectly, often requiring manual
ejection of the spent casing and chambering of the next round. •
According to petitioner, his alleged ignorance of any automatic firing
capability should have shielded him from criminal liability for his
failure to register the weapon. He requested the District Court to
instruct the jury that, to establish a violation of § 5861(d), the
Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant "knew
that the gun would fire fully automatically." 1 App. to Brief for
Appellant in No. 91-5033 (CA10), p. 42.

The District Court rejected petitioner's proposed instruction and
instead charged the jury as follows:

> "The Government need not prove the defendant knows he's dealing with a
> weapon possessing every last characteristic \[which subjects it\][**\[
> ... \]**](#Xb45075bb379e7ae7cfd09eb37721b5a61efc986) to the
> regulation. It would be enough to prove he knows that he is dealing
> with a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the likelihood
> of regulation." Tr. 465.

Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to five years' probation and a
\$5,000 fine.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. **\[ ... \]**

II

A

Whether or not § 5861(d) requires proof that a defendant knew of the
characteristics of his weapon that made it a "firearm" under the Act is
a question of statutory construction. **\[ ... \]**

Section 5861(d) is silent concerning the *mens rea* required for a
violation. It states simply that "\[i\]t shall be unlawful for any
person \... to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to
him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U. S.
C. § 5861(d). Nevertheless, silence on this point by itself does not
necessarily suggest that Congress intended to dispense with a
conventional *mens rea* element, which would require that the defendant
know the facts that make his conduct illegal. **\[ ... \]**On the
contrary, we must construe the statute in light of the background rules
of the common law, **\[ ... \]**in which the requirement of some *mens
rea* for a crime is firmly embedded. **\[ ... \]**

Relying on the strength of the traditional rule, we have stated that
offenses that require no *mens rea* generally are disfavored, *Liparota,
supra,* at 426, and have suggested that some indication of congressional
intent, express or implied, is required to dispense with *mens rea* as
an element of a crime. **\[ ... \]**

The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate and
restrict the circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in the
Government's view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning what
we have termed "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses, in which we
have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal liability
through statutes that do not require the defendant to know the facts
that make his conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we have
inferred from silence that Congress did not intend to require proof of
*mens rea* to establish an offense.

**\[ ... \]**

Typically, our cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that
regulate potentially harmful or injurious items. **\[ ... \]**In such
situations, we have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he
is dealing with a dangerous device of a character that places him "in
responsible relation to a public danger," *Dotterweich, supra,* at 281,
he should be alerted to the probability of strict regulation, and we
have assumed that in such cases Congress intended to place the burden on
the defendant to "ascertain at his peril whether \[his conduct\] comes
within the inhibition of the statute." *Balint, supra,* at 254. Thus, we
essentially have relied on the nature of the statute and the particular
character of the items regulated to determine whether congressional
silence concerning the mental element of the offense should be
interpreted as dispensing with conventional *mens rea* requirements. See
generally *Morissette, supra,* at 252-260.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X8a3a7d1a977dcfc610e5bfde4bb3cc526f08acc)

B

The Government argues that § 5861(d) defines precisely the sort of
regulatory offense described in *Balint.* In this view, all guns,
whether or not they are statutory "firearms," are dangerous devices that
put gun owners on notice that they must determine at their hazard
whether their weapons come within the scope of the Act. **\[ ... \]**

The Government seeks support for its position from our decision in
*United States* v. *Freed,* 401 U. S. 601 (1971), which involved a
prosecution for possession of unregistered grenades under §
5861(d).[**\[ ... \]**](#Xe219806b3e8975f4fdfc8d7d4ca460a0f1bb9d0) The
defendant knew that the items in his possession were grenades, and we
concluded that § 5861(d) did not require the Government to prove the
defendant also knew that the grenades were unregistered. *Id.,* at 609.
To be sure, in deciding that *mens rea* was not required with respect to
that element of the offense, we *suggested* that the Act "is a
regulatory measure in the interest of the public safety, which may well
be premised on the theory that one would hardly be surprised to learn
that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act." *Ibid.*
Grenades, we explained, "are highly dangerous offensive weapons, no less
dangerous than the narcotics involved in *United States* v. *Balint."
Ibid.* But that reasoning provides little support for dispensing with
*mens rea* in this case.

**\[ ... \]***\[O\]ur* analysis in *Freed* likening the Act to the
public welfare statute in *Balint* rested entirely on the assumption
that the defendant *knew* that he was dealing with hand grenades ---
that is, that he knew he possessed a particularly dangerous type of
weapon (one within the statutory definition of a "firearm"), possession
of which was not entirely "innocent" in and of itself. **\[ ... \]**

In glossing over the distinction between grenades and guns, *the*
Government ignores the particular care we have taken to avoid construing
a statute to dispense with *mens rea* where doing so would "criminalize
a broad range of apparently innocent conduct." *Liparota,* 471 U. S., at
426. In *Liparota,* we considered a statute that made unlawful the
unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps. We determined
that the statute required proof that the defendant knew his possession
of food stamps was unauthorized, largely because dispensing with such a
*mens rea* requirement would have resulted in reading the statute to
outlaw a number of apparently innocent acts. *Ibid.* Our conclusion that
the statute should not be treated as defining a public welfare offense
rested on the commonsense distinction that a "food stamp can hardly be
compared to a hand grenade." *Id.,* at 433.

Neither, in our view, can all guns be compared to hand grenades.
Although the contrast is certainly not as stark as that presented in
*Liparota,* the fact remains that there is a long tradition of
widespread lawful gun ownership by private individuals in this country.
Such a tradition did not apply to the possession of hand grenades in
*Freed* or to the selling of dangerous drugs that we considered in
*Balint.* **\[ ... \]**Guns in general are not "deleterious devices or
products or obnoxious waste materials," *International Minerals,*
*supra,* at 565, that put their owners on notice that they stand "in
responsible relation to a public danger," *Dotterweich,* 320 U. S., at
281.

**\[ ... \]**Even dangerous items can, in some cases, be so commonplace
and generally available that we would not consider them to alert
individuals to the likelihood of strict regulation. As suggested above,
despite their potential for harm, guns generally can be owned in perfect
innocence. Of course, we might surely classify certain categories of
guns --- no doubt including the machineguns, sawed-off shotguns, and
artillery pieces that Congress has subjected to regulation --- as items
the ownership of which would have the same quasi-suspect character we
attributed to owning hand grenades in *Freed.* But precisely because
guns falling outside those categories traditionally have been widely
accepted as lawful possessions, their destructive potential, while
perhaps even greater than that of some items we would classify along
with narcotics and hand grenades, cannot be said to put gun owners
sufficiently on notice of the likelihood of regulation to justify
interpreting § 5861(d) as not requiring proof of knowledge of a weapon's
characteristics.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X67a25623cbfc7a24117fb1b8503638d0ce4a19e)

Roughly 50 percent of American homes contain at least one firearm of
some sort,[**\[ ... \]**](#X6e88d02508b4c56c5bf4eeb2ccaa7081f7e523b) and
in the vast majority of States, buying a shotgun or rifle is a simple
transaction that would not alert a person to regulation any more than
would buying a car.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X709f3a6c768a1938e053e5465d545e5b67df582)

**\[ ... \]**

We concur in the Fifth Circuit's conclusion on this point: "It is
unthinkable to us that Congress intended to subject such law-abiding,
well-intentioned citizens to a possible ten-year term of imprisonment if
. . . what they genuinely and reasonably believed was a conventional
semi-automatic \[weapon\] turns out to have worn down into or been
secretly modified to be a fully automatic weapon." *Anderson, supra,* at
1254. As we noted in *Morissette,* the "purpose and obvious effect of
doing away with the requirement of a guilty intent is to ease the
prosecution's path to conviction." 342 U. S., at 263.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X5cfb9739e1ee9bf442d3cf49a18db5ba2862b46) We are reluctant to
impute that purpose to Congress where, as here, it would mean easing the
path to convicting persons whose conduct would not even alert them to
the probability of strict regulation in the form of a statute such as §
5861(d).

C

The potentially harsh penalty attached to violation of § 5861(d) --- up
to 10 years' imprisonment --- confirms our reading of the Act.
Historically, the penalty imposed under a statute has been a significant
consideration in determining whether the statute should be construed as
dispensing with *mens rea.* Certainly, the cases that first defined the
concept of the public welfare offense almost uniformly involved statutes
that provided for only light penalties such as fines or short jail
sentences, not imprisonment in the state penitentiary. **\[ ... \]**

*\[P\]unishing* a violation as a felony is simply incompatible with the
theory of the public welfare offense. In this view, absent a clear
statement from Congress that *mens rea* is not required, we should not
apply the public welfare offense rationale to interpret any statute
defining a felony offense as dispensing with *mens rea.* But see *United
States* v. *Balint,* 258 U. S. 250 (1922).

We need not adopt such a definitive rule of construction to decide this
case, however. Instead, we note only that where, as here, dispensing
with *mens rea* would require the defendant to have knowledge only of
traditionally lawful conduct, a severe penalty is a further factor
tending to suggest that Congress did not intend to eliminate a *mens
rea* *requirement*. In such a case, the usual presumption that a
defendant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal should
apply.

Ill

In short, we conclude that the background rule of the common law
favoring *mens rea* should govern interpretation of § 5861(d) in this
case. Silence does not suggest that Congress dispensed with *mens rea*
for the element of § 5861(d) at issue here. Thus, to obtain a
conviction, the Government should have been required to prove that
petitioner knew of the features of his AR-15 that brought it within the
scope of the Act.[**\[ ...

The question before us is not *whether* knowledge of possession is
required, but what level of knowledge suffices: (1) knowledge simply of
possession of the object; (2) knowledge, in addition, that the object is
a dangerous weapon; (3) knowledge, beyond dangerousness, of the
characteristics that render the object subject to regulation, for
example, awareness that the weapon is a machinegun.[**\[ ...

**\[ ... \]**

The Nation's legislators chose to place under a registration requirement
only a very limited class of firearms, those they considered especially
dangerous. The generally "dangerous" character of all guns, the Court
therefore observes, *ante,* at 611-612, did not suffice to give
individuals in Staples' situation cause to inquire about the need for
registration. Cf. *United States* v. *Balint,* 258 U. S. 250 (1922)
(requiring reporting of sale of strictly regulated narcotics, opium and
cocaine). Only the third reading, then, suits the purpose of the *mens
rea* requirement --- to shield people against punishment for apparently
innocent activity.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X980dd9605ee5148777b80bec2c314cfe0869477)

**\[ ... \]**

For these reasons, I conclude that conviction under § 5861(d) requires
proof that the defendant knew he possessed not simply a gun, but a
machinegun. **\[ ... \]**

dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

The Court is preoccupied with guns that "generally can be owned in
perfect innocence." *Ante,* at 611. This case, however, involves a
semiautomatic weapon that was readily convertible into a machinegun ---
a weapon that the jury found to be " 'a dangerous device of a type as
would alert one to the likelihood of regulation.'" *Ante,* at 604. These
are not guns "of some sort" that can be found in almost "50 percent of
American homes." *Ante,* at 613-614.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xdb58a51cb5d5267388bbc27e45669061be47daa) They are particularly
dangerous --- indeed, a substantial percentage of the unregistered
machineguns now in circulation are converted semiautomatic weapons.[**\[
... \]**](#Xaee38270ba020e8a20ec5edc29175c1dcf71ed4)

The question presented is whether the National Firearms Act imposed on
the Government the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only
that the defendant knew he possessed a dangerous device sufficient to
alert him to**\[ ... \]**regulation, but also that he knew it had all
the characteristics of a "firearm" as defined in the statute. **\[ ...
\]**

I

Contrary to the assertion by the Court, the text of the statute does
provide "explicit guidance in this case." Cf. *ante,* at 605. The
relevant section of the Act makes it "unlawful for any person \... to
receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the
National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U. S. C. §
5861(d). Significantly, the section contains no knowledge requirement,
nor does it describe a common-law crime.

**\[ ... \]**Because the offense involved in this case is entirely a
creature of statute, however, "the background rules of the common law,"
cf. *ante,* at 605, do not require a particular construction, and
critically different rules of construction apply. See *Morissette* v.
*United States,* 342 U. S., at 252-260.

In *Morissette,* Justice Jackson outlined one such interpretive rule:

> "Congressional silence as to mental elements in an Act merely adopting
> into federal statutory law a concept of crime already \... well
> defined in common law and statutory interpretation by the states may
> warrant quite contrary inferences than the same silence in creating an
> *offense* new to general law, for whose definition the courts have no
> guidance except the Act." *Id.,* at 262.

Although the lack of an express knowledge requirement in § 5861(d) is
not dispositive, see *United States* v. *United States Gypsum Co.,* 438
U. S. 422, 438 (1978), its absence suggests that Congress did not intend
to require proof that the defendant knew all of the facts that made his
conduct illegal.[**\[ ...

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The National Firearms Act unquestionably is a public welfare statute.
*United States* v. *Freed,* 401 U. S. 601, 609 (1971) (holding that this
statute "is *a regulatory* measure in the interest of the public
safety"). Congress fashioned a legislative scheme to regulate the
commerce and possession of certain types of dangerous devices, including
specific kinds of weapons, to protect the health and welfare of the
citizenry. To enforce this scheme, Congress created criminal penalties
for certain acts and omissions. The text of some of these offenses ---
including the one at issue here--- contains no knowledge requirement.

**\[ ... \]**

Both the Court and Justice Ginsburg erroneously rely upon the
"traditional\]" innocence of gun ownership to find that Congress must
have intended the Government to prove knowledge of all the
characteristics that make a weapon a statutory "firear\[m\]." *Ante,* at
610-612; *ante,* at 621-622 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment). **\[
... \]**As such, the Court instead reaches the rather surprising
conclusion that guns are more analogous to food stamps than to hand
grenades.[^19] Even if one accepts that dubious proposition, the Court
founds it upon a faulty premise: its mischaracterization of the
Government's submission as one contending that *"all guns . . .* are
dangerous devices that put gun owners on notice . . . *Ante,* at 608
(emphasis added).[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6607e0f7f2a5ffad12eb98035e9cc27ba5d23db) Accurately identified,
the Government's position presents the question whether guns such as the
one possessed by petitioner " 'are highly dangerous offensive weapons,
no less dangerous than the narcotics' " in *Balint* or the hand grenades
in *Freed,* see *ante,* at 609 (quoting *Freed,* 401 U. S., at
609).[**\[ ... \]**](#X86b06df5908822ef3a304fdc988c7e87dccab0d)

Thus, even assuming that the Court is correct that the mere possession
of an ordinary rifle or pistol does not entail sufficient danger to
alert one to the possibility of regulation, that conclusion does not
resolve this case. **\[ ... \]**

The enforcement of public welfare offenses always entails some
possibility of injustice. Congress nevertheless has repeatedly decided
that an overriding public interest in health or safety may outweigh that
risk when a person is dealing with products that are sufficiently
dangerous or deleterious to make it reasonable to presume that he either
knows, or should know, whether those products conform to special
regulatory requirements. The dangerous character of the product is
reasonably presumed to provide sufficient notice of the probability of
regulation to justify strict enforcement against those who are merely
guilty of negligent, rather than willful, misconduct.

This case presents no dispute about the dangerous character of
machineguns and sawed-off shotguns. Anyone in possession of such a
weapon is "standing in responsible relation to a public danger." See
*Dotterweich,* 320 U. S., at 281 (citation omitted). In the National
Firearms Act, Congress determined that the serious threat to health and
safety posed by the private ownership of such firearms warranted the
imposition of a duty on the owners of dangerous weapons to determine
whether their possession is lawful. Semiautomatic weapons that are
readily convertible into machineguns are sufficiently dangerous to alert
persons who knowingly possess them to the probability of stringent
public regulation. The jury's finding that petitioner knowingly
possessed "a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the
likelihood of regulation" adequately supports the conviction.

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

(a) Such factual mistake negatives the culpable mental state required
for the commission of an offense;  or

(b) The statute defining the offense or a statute related thereto

2. A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he
engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not, as a
matter of law, constitute an offense, unless such mistaken belief is
founded upon an official statement of the law contained in (a) a statute
or other enactment, or (b) an administrative order or grant of
permission, or (c) a judicial decision of a state or federal court, or

3. Notwithstanding the use of the term "knowingly" in any provision of
this chapter defining an offense in which the age of a child is an
element thereof, knowledge by the defendant of the age of such child is
not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless expressly so
provided, a defense to a prosecution therefor that the defendant did not
know the age of the child or believed such age to be the same as or
greater than that specified in the statute.

4. Notwithstanding the use of the term "knowingly" in any provision of
this chapter defining an offense in which the aggregate weight of a
controlled substance or marihuana is an element, knowledge by the
defendant of the aggregate weight of such controlled substance or
marihuana is not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, Plaintiff,\
v.\
ROBERT SOE, Defendant.

Justice Court of Village of Valley Stream, Nassau County.

September 9, 2005.

*Robert Soe,* defendant pro se.

*Howard O\'Rourke, Village Prosecutor,* Valley Stream, for plaintiff.

## OPINION OF THE COURT

## ROBERT G. BOGLE, J.

\[1070\] In a case of first impression, the court has been requested to
rule on the standard of proof for both the level of intent and voluntary
acts needed for legal sufficiency of a simplified infraction under the
Vehicle and Traffic Law of New York State. Accordingly, the motion of
the defendant to dismiss the simplified traffic information is
determined as hereby provided.

## Facts

The defendant, Robert Soe, is charged with failure to stop at a stop
sign, a traffic infraction under section 1172 of the Vehicle and Traffic
Law. The facts of the case are essentially without dispute. The
defendant was visiting a friend in Valley Stream, New York, Nassau
County, where he was staying after surgery. On April 26, 2005, he drove
a few miles away to Franklin Square to visit his daughter. On his way
back to his friend\'s house in Valley Stream, he began to feel
uncomfortable and pulled over to the side of the road. Three days
earlier, the defendant had been given a prescription for four different
medications, including Wellbutrin XL, a medicine known for blackouts and
seizures. After the defendant had rested for 20 minutes, he continued on
his trip back to his friend\'s house. At approximately 8:57 P.M., the
defendant\'s vehicle was observed, by the police patrolman, traveling
through a stop sign at the corner of Hendrickson and East avenues in the
Incorporated Village of Valley Stream, Nassau County, New York. The
defendant was issued a simplified traffic infraction for failure to stop
at a stop sign under Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1172.

The defendant claims that he was unaware that he had gone through the
stop sign. He also claims that he experienced a \"blackout\" or
\"seizure\" that resulted in his momentary lack of consciousness. The
defendant was also unfamiliar with the area as he was a temporary
visitor.

After the incident, the defendant revisited his doctor who informed him
that the use of Wellbutrin XL, plus the other prescription drugs he
consumed, could have resulted in both blackouts and/or seizures.
Therefore, the doctor readjusted the medicine, and no further
complications occurred.

Lastly, the defendant notes that, in 26 years of driving, this is the
first occurrence where a ticket has been issued.

## The Law

In order for this vehicle and traffic infraction to be dismissed, we
must examine, as we do in all criminal actions, if the elements \[1071\]
have or have not been satisfied. (*People v Zapletova,* 191 Misc 2d 48
\[Just Ct, Greene County 2002\].) This includes the most elementary of
aspects of criminal law, and includes what, if any, mental intent is
necessary (mens rea) and if the voluntary acts of the defendant were
sufficient (actus reus).

As a general rule, mental intent is usually determined by the language
of the statute such as \"intentionally,\" \"knowingly,\" \"recklessly\"
and \"criminal negligence.\" (Penal Law § 15.05; *People v Chessman,* 75
AD2d 187 \[2d Dept 1980\].) If the statute is silent, then proof of a
mental state can be presented if logically the offense would require a
mental state. (*People v Patterson,* 185 Misc 2d 519 \[Crim Ct, Bronx
County 2000\].) However, a court should interpret the statute in a
reasonable manner. (*Matter of* *Statewide Roofing v Eastern Suffolk Bd.
of Coop. Educ. Servs., First Supervisory Dist. of Suffolk County,* 173
Misc 2d 514 \[Sup Ct, Suffolk County 1997\].) Also, a court should not
read into a statute that which could not reasonably be found. (*Matter
of* *New York Life Ins. Co. v State Tax Commn.,* 80 AD2d 675 \[3d Dept
1981\], *affd* 55 NY2d 758 \[1981\].)

The statute under which the defendant is charged reads in relevant part:
\"Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every driver of a
vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop
sign\" (Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1172 \[a\]). For over 75 years, this
statute has remained unchanged and continuous under each generation of
the Vehicle and Traffic Law.

**\[ ... \]**

In *People v Baxter* (32 NYS2d 320 \[Utica City Ct 1941\], *affd* 178
Misc 625 \[Oneida County Ct 1942\]), a city court judge held in a
parking violation case that \"\[i\]ntent, while often an essential
element of a crime, is not an element of the offense here charged. This
is a traffic infraction rather than a crime.\" (*Baxter, supra* at 323.)
In *People v Janoske* (206 Misc 155 \[Broome County Ct 1954\]), the
County Court held, in a case charging improperly passing a stopped
school bus, that the People are not required to establish criminal
intent on the part of the defendant, \[1072\] so long as the prosecution
satisfactorily proves that it was a bona fide school bus displaying its
flashing red lights, and the bus driver did not grant permission for the
defendant\'s vehicle to proceed.

While *Baxter* and *Janoske* provide us with some guidance, both cases
concern the Vehicle and Traffic Law of 1929, and there are no cases
concerning the current 1960 law. However, such cases may have continued
authority if, as in the case at bar, the new Vehicle and Traffic Law
essentially mirrors its pre-1960 counterpart. There, the 1960 law would
be viewed as an uninterrupted continuation of the 1929 law. General City
Law § 95 supports this interpretation and reads as follows:

> \"Effect of the repeal of a statute by another statute substantially
> re-enacting the former
>
> \"The provisions of a law repealing a prior law, which are substantial
> re-enactments of provisions of the prior law, shall be construed as a
> continuation of such provisions of such prior law, modified or amended
> according to the language employed, and not as new enactments.\"

In a case similar to the case at bar, a trial judge held that, due to
the fact the Environmental Conservation Law was substantially a
reenactment of the old Conservation Law, it is to be construed as simply
a continuation of prior law and not a new enactment and should be
interpreted accordingly. (*People v Heath,* 77 Misc 2d 215 \[Schuyler
County Ct 1974\].)

Therefore, due to the identical nature of both the Vehicle and Traffic
Laws of 1929 and 1960, it is clear no intent is required for the traffic
infraction of failure to stop at a stop sign under Vehicle and Traffic
Law § 1172.

As intent is not at issue here, the next question to be addressed is did
the physical actions (actus reus) of the defendant satisfy the
requirements for a sufficient traffic infraction.

For criminal liability, there must be, at minimum, a voluntary act.
(*People v Carlo,* 46 AD2d 764 \[1st Dept 1974\].) As a general rule, a
\"voluntary act\" means a bodily movement performed consciously as a
result of effort or determination (Penal Law § 15.00 \[2\].)

The definition of a \"voluntary act\" excludes reflex actions or bodily
movements performed during unconsciousness, hypnosis, amnesia or similar
mental states. (*People v Hager,* 124 Misc 2d 123 \[Nassau County Ct
1984\]; *see also Matter of* *National El. Indus. v New York State Tax
Commn.,* 49 NY2d 538 \[1980\].)

\[1073\] While an act may be criminal without intent or knowledge, an
involuntary act is not criminal. (Penal Law § 15.10; *People v
Marzulli,* 76 Misc 2d 971 \[App Term, 2d Dept 1973\].) To sustain a
crime or violation, it is an absolute necessity that there at least be
some form of voluntary act or omission. (*People v Shaughnessy,* 66 Misc
2d 19 \[Nassau Dist Ct 1971\].)

In the instant case, it is clear the defendant suffered from unforeseen
seizures and blackouts, resulting in his failure to stop at the stop
sign. There is sufficient medical evidence and testimony to establish
that the defendant was unconscious and his action of passing through the
stop sign was an involuntary act. Thus, as a result of the
involuntariness of the defendant\'s actions, the People have failed to
satisfy the statutory requirements for the charges in the instant case.

Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the simplified traffic infraction is
granted in its entirety.

Appellant filed a petition for discretionary review with this Court,
arguing \[among other things that the court erred\] in holding that her
unawareness about her ineligibility to vote "was irrelevant to her
prosecution;" ... \[We find that\] the court below erred by failing to
require proof that the Appellant had actual knowledge that it was a
crime for her to vote while on supervised release. We remand to that
court to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence under the correct
interpretation of the statute.

**BACKGROUND**

In the 2004 general election, Appellant filled out an Affidavit of
Provisional Voter form. The form included the following affirmation: the
voter had not been finally convicted of a felony, or if a felon, had
completed all punishment including any term of incarceration, parole,
supervision, or period of probation, or had been pardoned. The form
served as an application for voter registration in Tarrant County from
that point forward. Tarrant County accepted the form and registered
Appellant as a voter. Appellant voted in the 2008 elections in Tarrant
County.

 

In 2011, Appellant pled guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to
defraud the United States arising out of a phony tax preparation scheme.
[*United States v. Mason-Hobbs*, Nos. 4:13-CV-078-A, 4:11-CR-151-A-1,

The federal court sentenced her to five years' imprisonment and three
years of supervision after her release and ordered her to pay full
restitution to the U.S. government (\$4,206,805.49).

In accordance with requirements of the National Voting Rights Act
(NVRA)[^2^](#X6da2a9c43681d4c1c89a1ec729781dd11955ed5), Tarrant County
received a report which included Appellant\'s felony conviction and
sentence. In 2013, the Tarrant County Elections Administration (TCEA)
mailed a Notice of Examination to Appellant\'s listed home address. The
notice stated that TCEA was examining her registration based on
information about her felony conviction and informing her that if she
did not reply within 30 days with adequate information to show her
qualification to stay registered, her registration would be **\*625**
cancelled. *See* [Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §
16.033](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS16.033&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)).

 

When the 30-day deadline passed without response, TCEA mailed a notice
to the same address stating that Appellant\'s voter registration had
been cancelled and that she was entitled to a hearing and appeal. When
both notices were mailed, Appellant was in federal custody serving her
sentence, and she testified at trial that she did not receive the
notices. Neither notice was returned to TCEA, however. TCEA cancelled
Mason\'s registration.

 

After finishing her prison term and while on supervised release,
Appellant reported to her probation officer that she would resume living
at the same address as before. At trial, a supervisor from the probation
office testified that no one from that office told Appellant she was
ineligible to vote while on supervised release.

 

On November 8, 2016, Appellant went to her designated polling place for
the general election. The election worker checking the registration roll
could not find her name, so workers offered to let her complete a
provisional ballot, which she agreed to do. She completed the affidavit,
just as she had done in 2004, and electronically cast her provisional
ballot. The election worker who had checked the registration roll
reported a concern about Appellant\'s provisional ballot to the election
judge for Appellant\'s precinct, who happened to be Mason\'s neighbor.
The election judge then reported the concern to the district attorney\'s
office. Appellant\'s ballot was not counted in the election.

 

Appellant was ultimately indicted for voting in an election in which she
knew she was not eligible to vote. The indictment alleged that she had
not been fully discharged from her sentence for the felony conviction.
She waived a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial. Her defensive
theories at trial were that she did not read the admonishments in the
Affidavit of Provisional Voter, the government never told her she could
not vote as a convicted felon, and she would not have voted had she
known she was ineligible.

 

After conviction, Appellant filed a motion for new trial, which the
trial court denied after holding an evidentiary hearing. The court
issued written findings and conclusions, including that any rational
factfinder could have found the State proved "the essential elements
that the Defendant voted and that she was ineligible to vote," and that
she "voted" when she cast her provisional ballot.

**DIRECT APPEAL**

On direct appeal, Appellant argued five grounds: the evidence was both
legally and factually insufficient to support the guilt finding;
Texas\'s Illegal Voting statute was preempted by the part of the Help
America Vote Act that grants the right to cast a provisional ballot; her
conviction resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel; and the
Illegal Voting statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to her.

 

The Second Court of Appeals overruled Appellant\'s grounds and held,
relevant to this proceeding, that the evidence was sufficient to support
her conviction. [*Mason*, 598 S.W.3d at 781,
789](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2050600207&pubNum=0004644&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_4644_781&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_sp_4644_781).
The court below said that the State needed only to prove that Appellant
voted while knowing of the existence of the condition that made her
ineligible---in this case, that she was on federal supervised release
after imprisonment for a final felony conviction.

 

...

** **

Appellant filed for discretionary review, arguing that the court of
appeals' holding conflicts with our recent decision in [*Delay v.
State*](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2036745937&pubNum=0004644&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)),
in which we held that when the *mens rea* element of an Election Code
offense is "knowingly," the accused must "actually realize" the conduct
violated the Election Code. [465 S.W. 3d 232, 251--52 (Tex. Crim. App.
2014)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2036745937&pubNum=0004644&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_4644_251&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_sp_4644_251).
Specifically, this Court held that "knowingly" undertaking an act in
violation of the Election Code means the actor must be aware not only of
the circumstances that render conduct unlawful but also of the fact that
the conduct violates the Election Code. [*Id.* at
250](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2036745937&pubNum=0004644&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_4644_250&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_sp_4644_250).
Appellant argues that she explicitly testified she did not know she was
ineligible to vote due to being on federal supervised release and that
the State\'s only evidence regarding Appellant\'s knowledge was based on
speculation she had read the provisional ballot affidavit.

 

During the pendency of this PDR, the Texas Legislature added new
language to the Illegal Voting statute via Senate Bill 1 (S.B.1) during
a special session, effective December 2, 2021. Act of Aug. 31, 2021,
87th Leg., 2d C.S., § 9.03, [sec.
64.012](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)),

now specifies that a person "may not be convicted solely upon the fact
that the person signed a provisional ballot affidavit under Section
63.011 unless corroborated by other evidence that the person knowingly
committed the offense." *Id.* The amendment clarifies that a provisional
ballot affidavit alone is insufficient evidence that the person
knowingly committed the offense. Corroboration by other evidence is
required for conviction.

 

Furthermore, the Legislature included a savings clause in S.B. 1 that
applied the legislation to anyone who committed an offense before, on,
or after the effective date of the Act, except for final convictions.
*Id.* at § 9.04. The law\'s effective date was December 2, 2021. . . .

 

. . . \[T\]he change to the statute alone does not decriminalize
Appellant\'s conduct. This is because **\*628** the Legislature\'s use
of the word "solely" means, unambiguously, that merely signing an
affidavit is not, alone, sufficient evidence to secure a conviction for
illegal voting; there must be other evidence to corroborate that the
defendant knew she was ineligible to vote.

 

**ANALYSIS**

**I.**

In Appellant\'s first ground, she argues that the court of appeals erred
by concluding that her knowledge of her ineligibility to vote was
irrelevant to her prosecution. We agree that this Court\'s precedent and
the legislative history support the conclusion that actual knowledge of
one\'s ineligibility is an element of the offense of illegal voting.

We held that "knowingly" undertaking an action "in violation of the

(emphasis added). To construe the statute to mean that a person can be
guilty even if she does *not* "know\[ \] the person is not eligible to

**\*630** *ii. Consistent with Legislative Intent*

The recent amendment to the Illegal Voting statute demonstrates that the
court of appeals' strict liability reading of the statute---that, to be
found guilty of this offense, an individual need not know that he or she
is ineligible to vote or that voting while being ineligible is a
crime---"would lead to absurd consequences that the Legislature could
not possibly have intended." *See* [*Boykin v. State,* 818 S.W.2d 782,

Specifically, the following exchange occurred between Representative

John Turner:

1.  TURNER: You heard my reference a few moments ago to the case of
    Crystal Mason. And would you agree with me, Representative, that
    five years in prison is a serious deprivation of a person\'s
    liberty?

BURROWS: I could not imagine.

1.  TURNER: And it seems to have been acknowledged that she did not
    realize that she was ineligible to vote. But her conviction has
    currently been upheld, although it\'s still on appeal, because that
    statute has been interpreted to say that all that was necessary was
    for her to know that she was on supervised release even though she
    didn\'t realize that fact made her ineligible. Have I summarized
    **\*631** that matter correctly to your knowledge?

BURROWS: My understanding is the same as yours. And as you said earlier,
I would not have known that being on supervised release would have made
you ineligible. That is a high bar to impute on somebody to put them
away for five years.

1.  TURNER: I know her case is now on appeal. And of course, we have
    separate branches of government and it\'s not our role here in the
    legislature to tell any other branch of government what to do or how
    to rule in a case. But it seems to me that it is appropriate, given
    the fact that we adopted and then accepted the removal of the Cain
    amendment, to explain ourselves to some degree and express the sense
    of the house about the issue it dealt with. Do you agree that
    that\'s appropriate here?

BURROWS: I think it is, and I think that we are reiterating and
restating what is the current law. Obviously, the courts are about to
decide what it is, but my interpretation of current law is you have to
have a mens rea element. As we said, this is not a strict liability-type
of issue. So I believe this resolution actually conforms with what the
current law is today, and the Cain amendment was no different, which is
why this body has adopted it several times.

J., filed a dissenting opinion.

... **A. Contrary to the language in the Court\'s opinion suggesting
otherwise, the illegal-voting statute merely requires knowledge of
ineligibility to vote and allows the fact-finder to reasonably infer the
defendant\'s subjective knowledge based on the evidence.**

Under the plain language of [Election Code Section
64.012(a)(1)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_7b9b000044381),
a person is guilty of illegal voting if she "votes or attempts to vote
in an election in which the person knows the person is not eligible to
vote." [Tex. Elec. Code §
64.012(a)(1)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_7b9b000044381).
The statute\'s culpable mental state requirement is explicit and
unambiguous---the State must prove that the defendant subjectively knew
that her status as a felon rendered her ineligible to vote.

 

Because the statute is unambiguous, the Court\'s analysis of the
statute\'s *mens rea* requirement should end there. . .

 

. . .

 

Another concern with the Court\'s analysis is that it suggests the State
must present *direct* evidence that Appellant knew she was ineligible to
vote. Specifically, the Court\'s opinion holds that the statute requires
proof that Appellant "*actually realized* that these circumstances \...
in fact rendered her ineligible to vote" because the statute "requires
actual knowledge of one\'s ineligibility to vote." *See* Maj. Op. at
632. . . . Such language could be construed as indicating that the State
must prove more than a person\'s simple awareness of the circumstance
that she was ineligible to vote. This approach would also conflict with
the well-established principle that a person\'s knowledge may be
inferred from the totality of the circumstances. *. . .* Direct evidence
is not required. In short, to the extent that the Court\'s analysis
could be construed as imposing some kind of enhanced knowledge
requirement here, I cannot agree with its approach.

 

1.  **Remand is unnecessary because the evidence is sufficient to
    support the verdict.**

After correcting the court of appeals' error in its interpretation of
the pre-amendment version of [Section
64.012](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)),
the Court remands the case for a new sufficiency review. The Court\'s
approach in remanding the case is not unreasonable, but I find it
unnecessary. Given the circumstances here, I believe that judicial
economy considerations weigh in favor of simply resolving the
sufficiency question before us in this proceeding.

 

A sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge requires us to determine
"whether, after viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to
the verdict, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential
elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt." . . . Under the
hypothetically-correct jury charge for this case, the State was required
to prove that Appellant: (1) knowingly or intentionally voted or
attempted to vote in an election, (2) in which she was not eligible to
vote, and (3) she knew she was ineligible to vote. *See* [Tex. Elec.
Code §
64.012(a)(1)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_7b9b000044381).
Additionally, based on the legislative amendment, the statute further
provides that "\[a\] person may not be convicted solely upon the fact
that the person signed a provisional ballot affidavit under Section
63.011 unless corroborated by other evidence that the person knowingly
committed the offense." [*Id.* §
64.012(c)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5).[^2^](#X02fecb46ee00514830c6cab9676c86e7b169396)

 

2.  **The evidence is sufficient to support the verdict.**

Keeping in mind that we must view the evidence in the light most
favorable to the verdict, I will examine the evidence supporting the
only element at issue here---whether Appellant knew she was ineligible
to vote.

1.  **Appellant\'s voting experience**

The November 2016 election was not the first time Appellant attempted to
vote without being registered to do so. In 2004, Appellant was not yet
registered to vote but tried to vote anyway. Because she was not
registered, she had to fill out an Affidavit of Provisional Voter form.
That form included an affirmation that the affiant "had not been finally
convicted of a felony; or if a felon, had completed all punishments
including any term of incarceration, parole, supervision, or period of
probation; or had been pardoned." Maj. Op. at 624. By filling out and
signing this form, Appellant learned the requirements for voter
eligibility. *. . .*

 

Appellant\'s 2004 provisional ballot operated as her voter registration.
Thereafter, she voted as a registered voter in the 2008 general
election. No provisional ballot was needed. From March 2012 until August
2016, Appellant was incarcerated following a federal felony conviction
for conspiring to defraud the United States. During the November 2016
general election, Appellant was on supervised release but she still went
to vote at her designated polling location. Precinct workers could not
find Appellant\'s name in their paper records or online database. A
precinct volunteer asked Appellant if there was any reason she would not
be in their record of registered **\*644** voters. She responded that
she had been living at her same address since 2008. In truth, Appellant
lived at the residence until she was incarcerated in March 2012, and
then again after she was released from a halfway house in August 2016.
The fact-finder could have rationally inferred that Appellant\'s voting
experience provided her with personal knowledge of voter eligibility and
that her statement about living at the same address during the entire
preceding eight years was indicative of her intent to hide her status as
a felon.

 

The State also introduced evidence that the local county elections
office mailed Appellant two notices concerning her voter ineligibility
after her federal conviction. . . . Appellant was incarcerated at the
time of both notices. Even so, neither notice was returned as
undeliverable, and Appellant returned to the same address following her
release. Although Appellant did not specify who lived at the residence
while she was in prison, she testified that she has three children of
her own and cared for her brother\'s four children as well. Accordingly,
the fact-finder could have reasonably inferred that Appellant either
received the notices once she returned to the residence in 2016, or that
another person living in the home forwarded Appellant\'s mail to her
while she was in prison.

 

Much of the evidence at trial centered on Appellant\'s completion of the
provisional ballot affidavit. As the Court recognizes, during the
pendency of this appeal the Legislature amended the illegal-voting
statute to clarify that a defendant "may not be convicted solely upon
the fact that the person signed a provisional ballot affidavit \...
unless corroborated by other evidence that the person knowingly
committed the offense." [Tex. Elec. Code §
64.012(c)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000174&cite=TXELS64.012&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5).
While the amended statute forbids conviction where the *only* evidence
is the completion of a provisional ballot affidavit, it still allows
consideration of the affidavit as evidence when the person\'s knowledge
of her ineligibility to vote is *corroborated* by other evidence. As
laid out above, such corroboration exists here. Therefore, Appellant\'s
completion of the provisional ballot supports her conviction because it
provided additional notice of her ineligibility to vote.

 

. . .

Part of the fact-finder\'s responsibility is to assess the credibility
of the witnesses. In doing so, the fact finder may believe all, some, or
none of a witness\'s testimony. [*Romano v. State*, 610 S.W.3d 30, 34
(Tex. Crim. App.
2020)](https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2052241623&pubNum=0004644&originatingDoc=Idbb85050d23211ecbba4d707ee4952c4&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_4644_34&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Keycite)#co_pp_sp_4644_34).
Applying this concept and in viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the trial court\'s verdict, the judge as the trier-of-fact
had the evidence needed to support the conviction and clearly did not
believe Appellant\'s self-serving testimony claiming that she did not
know she was ineligible to vote.

 

Appellant\'s felon status comes from a federal conviction for conspiracy
to defraud the United States. The rules of evidence permit the
introduction of a prior criminal conviction to attack a witness\'s
character for truthfulness if the offense is a felony or a crime of
moral turpitude. [Tex. R. Evid.

crime of dishonesty, the trial court was authorized to consider
Appellant\'s fraud conviction when assessing her credibility. Further,
Appellant\'s testimony conflicted with the testimony of two State\'s
witnesses. When asked about the differing accounts, she accused both
witnesses of lying. Appellant first denied talking with or even seeing
the precinct election judge, which contradicted his testimony that he
spoke with Appellant about her voter registration status, searched for
her name in the paper voter files and online voter database, and helped
her with the provisional ballot. Appellant then testified that the
precinct volunteer witness lied about observing Appellant\'s finger
trace the words on the ballot form as she read them. In addition, when
asked on cross-examination about a newspaper article stating that
Appellant admitted to the reporter that she had skimmed the ballot
affidavit, Appellant initially denied saying this. She later conceded
that she must have said it, but consistently denied making another
statement quoted in the article about being targeted for prosecution and
suggested that the reporter was untruthful. In all, tasked with the
responsibility of making credibility determinations and resolving
conflicts in the evidence, the fact-finder could have reasonably
concluded that Appellant\'s fraud conviction negatively impacted her
credibility and that it was more likely that Appellant was lying. The
fact-finder could have also determined that the other witnesses were
credible. As such, it was rational for the fact-finder to disregard
Appellant\'s testimony while accepting the testimony of the other
witnesses.

. . . Appellant\'s completion of the affidavit was corroborated by her
voting history, eyewitness testimony suggesting Appellant actually read
the provisional ballot affidavit language, and the two notices informing
Appellant that her voter registration was revoked. The trial court was
not obligated to believe Appellant\'s self-serving testimony that she
was unaware of her ineligibility to vote. Accordingly, in the interest
of judicial economy and because there is sufficient evidence for the
trial court to have rationally found that Appellant was aware of her
ineligibility to vote, I would resolve this issue here and overrule
Appellant\'s first ground for review. For these reasons, I respectfully
dissent.

**She Was Sentenced to Prison for Voting**

**Crystal Mason was convicted of voter fraud after the 2016 election,
when she cast a ballot without realizing she was ineligible to vote**

** **

It was the day of the full solar eclipse on the outskirts of Fort Worth
last April, and Crystal Mason was trying, just for a second, to relax.

She was barefoot, her feet curled up on a big leather La-Z-Boy sofa,
eating two of the turkey sandwiches she had prepared for lunch for her
family. Her granddaughter Courtney was turning five that weekend, and
Mason was getting everything in place for a princess-themed party.

Mason, 49, had every reason to celebrate. Just a few weeks earlier, a
Texas appeals court [had thrown out her five-year prison
sentence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/28/crystal-mason-texas-woman-acquitted) for
voter fraud. Mason had been fighting the charge ever since 2017, when
she was arrested for trying to cast a provisional ballot while
ineligible to vote. She has always said she did not know she could not
vote and would not have tried to cast a ballot had she known.

Mason had been convicted and sentenced to five years in prison in 2018.

Her case touched a national nerve and became widely understood as an
egregious punishment for what could easily be explained as a mistake. As
Donald Trump claimed massive voter fraud in the 2016 election, Mason's
case was seen as part of a broader Republican effort to intimidate
people from voting. And while Trump [escalated
claims](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/02/donald-trump-video-statement-baseless-vote-fraud-claims) of
fraud through the 2020 election and its aftermath, Mason's case stood
out as a clear example of what an indiscriminate crackdown on voter
fraud looks like.

Since Mason's arrest, efforts to prosecute voter fraud have only
escalated. Tarrant county, where Mason lives, [launched its own voter
fraud
taskforce](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/politics/elections/new-election-integrity-task-force-tarrant-county/287-84c0a3f5-d800-4e21-8460-e1c25b116e2e).
Several Republican-led states [have created
units](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-florida-georgia-4db14ddccf37e4597cb9b7f20ec499b4) to
investigate and pursue voter fraud charges. One of those units, in
Florida, [has filed dozens of
cases](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/25/florida-voting-fraud-charges-eligibility),
almost all of which have been against people like Mason, who have prior
felony convictions and were confused about their eligibility. In the
initial wave of 20 people who were arrested, 14 were Black. One of them
was [arrested at
gunpoint](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/12/florida-police-man-arrest-voter-fraud-body-camera).

"I'm certain these prosecutions of individuals with felony convictions
instill fear, which I believe is the intended outcome," said Dawn
Harrington, the executive director of the Free Hearts organization, who
works to restore voting rights to people with felony convictions. In
Tennessee, where Harrington works, she's seen prosecutions in at least
five counties (the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation [announced 11
arrests](https://tbinewsroom.com/2024/06/04/11-arrested-in-tbi-election-registration-investigation/) for
voter fraud last week, but offered few details on what happened). Taken
in context of a historical legacy of voter suppression, Harrington said
she believed high-profile prosecutions "serve as stark warnings, showing
severe consequences for attempting to vote".

Since being convicted, Mason has remained out of prison on an appeal
bond for several years, trying to get her life back on track. She's lost
multiple jobs and had trouble getting new ones because of the bad
publicity from her case, and nearly lost her home to foreclosure. The
last few years of waiting had felt like having "one foot in, one foot
out", she said. Her kids and her mother said that some nights she would
come home and cry.

So when she got news of the acquittal in March, Mason, who was getting
dinner at a drive-through at the time, broke down crying. It was a
moment of vindication -- and a sign that she could move on with her
life.

Then the district attorney announced he was appealing the case.

\--

People with felony convictions make ripe targets for politicians wanting
to send a message about voter fraud.

Since the Jim Crow era, [states have
barred](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/racism-felony-disenfranchisement-intertwined-history) former
felons from voting, a practice that kept many African Americans from the
polls even after they were constitutionally granted the right to vote.

Today, 48 states continue this practice, though the rules vary widely by
state. Several -- like California, Colorado and New York -- allow anyone
to vote when they complete their prison sentence, while others require
completion of probation and parole. Some states, like Mississippi and
Tennessee, permanently bar those convicted of certain crimes from ever
voting, while others require repayment of all fines, fees and
restitution before someone can vote again.

It's a legacy that continues to have broad implications. As of 2022, an
estimated 4.4 million people -- 2% of the adult eligible population --
couldn't vote because of a felony conviction, according to a[ 2022
analysis](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/locked-out-2022-estimates-of-people-denied-voting-rights/)** **by
the Sentencing Project, a criminal-justice non-profit. Around 5% of
voting-age African Americans can't vote because of a felony conviction
-- a rate more than three times higher than other Americans.

The vast majority of people who can't vote because of a felony -- about
75% -- are not in prison -- but they are an easy target for perceived
voter fraud. Since they are branded criminals, there's little public
sympathy for their cases; those charged often have little interest in
speaking out publicly.

A single prosecution can also have a big ripple effect. Those who are
trying to put their criminal history behind them know that a single
misstep can land them back in trouble, so they aren't willing to take
that risk.

Since Mason was arrested, there have been a few more high-profile
prosecutions of people with felony convictions. In 2021, Texas
authorities [arrested Hervis
Rogers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/09/texas-voter-arrested-hervis-rogers-ken-paxton),
a Houston man who gained national attention for waiting seven hours in
line to vote. The case was eventually thrown out on appeal, but Rogers,
who is Black, has since [said he will never vote
again](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/election/2024/article/hervis-rogers-harris-county-voting-18688631.php).

In 2022, Pamela Moses, a Black woman in Tennessee, was sentenced to six
years in prison for trying to vote while on probation for a felony. Her
conviction was later overturned after the Guardian [published government
documents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/27/pamela-moses-voting-rights-mistake-jail) that
were not disclosed to her defense.

Perhaps no state has deployed this strategy more aggressively than
Florida. In 2022, the state governor, Ron DeSantis, created the office
of election crimes and security, a first-of-its-kind agency to crack
down on election fraud, which is exceedingly rare. That summer, DeSantis
held a televised press conference announcing the arrests of more than 20
people for illegally voting. The press conference announcing the arrest
was a spectacle -- DeSantis appeared at in a courtroom, flanked by
uniformed law enforcement officers. All of the people charged had prior
murder or sexual offenses, which made them permanently ineligible to
vote in Florida.

But after DeSantis's press conference, it became clear that nearly
everyone charged was [confused about their
eligibility](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/25/florida-voting-fraud-charges-eligibility).
Florida had made it easier for people with many felony convictions to
vote in 2019, and the people the state was targeting appeared to not
understand that the change didn't apply to them. All had received voter
registration cards from the state, a sign they took to mean they were
eligible to vote.

Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, specializes in
assisting people with felony convictions get their voting rights back.
One of the states where she works is Alabama, where a recent change in
the law has increased the number of people with felonies who can vote.
But Bowie said she had been in contact with people in Alabama who were
newly re-enfranchised but had heard about the Florida prosecutions and
were wary of trying to register to vote.

After initially expressing interest in getting their rights back, some
of the people she had spoken to told her it wasn't worth it.

"I'm the sole breadwinner in my family. I can't do this," they told her.
"I don't want to go back to prison."

**\--**

Mason wasn't especially political in 2016: she voted because her mother
was nagging her to. Until recently, she compared voting to taking a
shower after playing outside before you go to bed. "It's just something
you're supposed to do."

When she showed up at her polling station in 2016, a church near her
home, election workers couldn't find her name on the list of registered
voters, so they offered her a chance to vote with a provisional ballot,
intended for exactly that kind of circumstance.

If a voter shows up at the polls and there's a question about their
eligibility, they can cast a provisional vote that is only counted if
officials later confirm the voter is eligible to cast a ballot.
Mason [filled out the
affidavit](https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2019/07/26/5d3b706ce4b0c31569eada09.pdf) that
went along with the ballot, taking care to ensure that all of the
information exactly matched what was on her driver's license.

The poll workers had no reason to question her eligibility -- they were
her neighbors and knew who she was. They knew that she wasn't lying
about her identity and presented a
valid [Texas](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas) driver's
license.

It was only after she left that Jarrod Streibich, a high school teenager
volunteering in his first election, said he remembered that Mason had
recently returned home from federal prison for a tax felony.

Texas, like several other states, doesn't allow someone to vote until
they have entirely finished their criminal sentence, including probation
or parole. Streibich alerted the head poll worker, Karl Diederich, who
lived across the street from Mason. Diederich, who was involved with the
local Republican party, wasn't sure whom to call, but he would later
contact the local district attorney.

Mason was one of about [4,000
people](https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2019/08/15/5d55b144e4b056fafd08e1f1.pdf) in
Tarrant county who cast a provisional ballot in 2016. Several months
later, she would become the only one to be indicted for it. In February
2017, she was placed in handcuffs at the federal courthouse in downtown
Dallas during a routine check-in with her supervised release officer.

\-

Since she was arrested for voter fraud, Mason said she went from being
someone who didn't want to talk about politics to starting an
organization focused on combating voter suppression.

In 2022, [she
opened](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/crystal-mason-texas-court-ruling-fight-to-vote) a
rally for Beto O'Rourke, who was running for governor. Texas lawmakers
passed a law designed to make it harder for someone like Mason to be
prosecuted for voter fraud. Four of her children and several other
family members are volunteer deputy voter registrars in Texas and are
eligible to sign people up to vote.

"You can hardly talk to Crystal Mason for five minutes without her
trying to sign someone up to vote," Alison Grinter, one of her
attorneys, said in March.

But there was never really any doubt that Crystal Mason's case was about
much more than Crystal Mason. Prosecutors said it themselves at her
trial.

"The voting system in America is second to none. It is sacred to
Americans, and she has violated the sanctity of this process," Matthew
Smid, the prosecutor during Mason's case, [said during sentencing at her
trial](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6219544-Crystal-Mason-Trial-Transcript.html#document/p177/a514861).
"We respectfully request that this court send a message to illegal
voters that if you're going to violate the sanctity of this system, it
will not be tolerated and \[you\] will pay the consequences."

That language set off alarm bells for Kim Cole, another of Mason's
lawyers. Voter fraud in the US is extremely rare; many cases of illegal
voting often involve people who simply were confused about their
eligibility to vote. During the Jim Crow era, lawmakers often invoked
the need to preserve the purity of the ballot box to justify racist
restrictions on voting.

"It's not even subtle," Cole said. "I think it did intimidate people."

** **

It would have been easy enough for Mason to make the case go away.
Before she went to trial in 2018, prosecutors offered her the chance to
plead guilty and receive 10 years of probation. Many in her position
accept these kinds of offers; it's part of why prosecutors often target
people with felony convictions -- those who are charged are willing to
plead guilty quickly, giving prosecutors a conviction they can tout.

But Mason believed she hadn't done anything wrong. And since she was
already on supervised release, she risked going back to federal prison
if she pleaded guilty to the voting crime. "There's no way I would have
ever taken a plea," she said. "If I'm pleading, that means I'm leaving
my kids. And I could never -- me being a mom -- I could never just leave
my kids."

So on 28 March 2018, Mason and her entire family showed up at the
criminal courthouse in downtown Fort Worth. Mason's lawyer had assured
her that it would be an "open and closed" case and so Mason had only
taken one day off from her new job (she had lost her old one when she
was arrested).

The trial started off pretty well. The first witness was Kenneth Mays, a
supervisor in the supervised release office. [He
testified](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6219544-Crystal-Mason-Trial-Transcript.html#document/p20/a514777) that
no one had told Mason she couldn't vote.

But when Diederich and Streibich took the stand, things went south.
Diederich, a navy veteran who had recently returned from Afghanistan,
testified that he had instructed Mason to read [a lengthy
disclaimer](https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2019/07/26/5d3b706ce4b0c31569eada09.pdf) on
the provisional affidavit before she filled it out. Buried in the long
paragraph is language requiring anyone filling out the form to affirm
that if they have been convicted of a felony, they have completed "all
of my punishment, including any term of incarceration, parole, and
supervision".

Diederich testified that he couldn't say for sure whether Mason read the
warning, but that it appeared that she did and he wouldn't have let her
vote if he didn't think she had. Streibich, just a few weeks from
leaving for the air force academy, testified that he saw Mason going
over the form with her finger.

When Mason took the stand, it hardly seemed to matter what she said. She
said she had never even seen Diederich at the polls and never read the
affidavit. Had anyone told her she wasn't eligible, she said, she
wouldn't have voted. "Why would I dare jeopardize losing a good job,
saving my house, and leaving my kids again and missing my son from
graduating from high school this year as well as going to college on a
football scholarship? I wouldn't dare do that," she said.

But Smid, the prosecutor, focused on undermining her credibility. Who
should the judge believe? Diederich, the navy veteran, and Streibich,
who was committed to military service, or Mason, who had old convictions
for tax fraud and perjury? He dismissed the idea she wouldn't commit a
crime because she wanted to support her family. "You were not thinking
about them when you defrauded the United States government of \$4.2m,
were you?" Smid said. (Mason, a former tax preparer, was originally
convicted in 2012 on charges related to inflating tax refunds for
clients and was ordered to pay \$4.2m in restitution.)

Gonzalez convicted her and sentenced her to five years in prison. Mason
was in disbelief.

News outlets started to pick up on the case. Her conviction came after
another woman in Tarrant county, a legal non-citizen, had been sentenced
to seven years in prison for also mistakenly voting. Around the same
time, there was a white justice of the peace in the same county [who
pleaded
guilty](https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article209608374.html) to
forging signatures on a ballot but was sentenced to probation and no
prison time.

The disparity between the sentences for the two women of color and a
white elected official highlighted the blunt racial disparities that
seemed to be at play. Still, Mason didn't really want to speak out about
the case. "My motto has always been 'my business is not show business',"
she said. That, and she wanted to keep her job.

That all changed a few months later. Because Mason was still on
supervised release while she had been convicted of the state crime, she
was sent back to federal prison for an additional 10 months.

This was an especially difficult time for Mason. When she had gotten out
of prison the first time, she had vowed never to go back and had pledged
to take care of her family.

Calling her the breadwinner doesn't quite capture what she means to her
family. She has three children of her own, and raised four of her
brother's children. She also has nine grandchildren. Until fairly
recently, they all lived with her in her big house.

Her 25-year-old niece, Jasmine Jones, compared her to the cornerstone of
a building. Without her, she said, everything would crumble. Her son
Sanford, whom she calls Bobo, agreed. "She's the boss of the company,"
he said. "She provides all of the kids with the things they need."

When she went back to federal prison at the end of 2018, she trained
Taylor,** **her daughter, on how to manage the family's finances. At the
time, Taylor had not even ever paid a phone bill. Her teenage son left
college during his freshman year on a football scholarship, returning
home to help with the finances. The family almost lost their big house
on the outskirts of Fort Worth -- the one she and her ex-husband
purchased more than a decade ago to be a home base for their family --
to foreclosure.

"They don't know the strain it took on our family," Taylor said on the
afternoon of the eclipse, keeping an eye on her three-year-old son,
Karter, who was running around nearby.

Back in federal prison, Mason started reflecting on her case. She knew
the judge who convicted and sentenced her was elected by voters, and she
began to understand the power of one vote -- and why someone would want
to limit hers.

She decided that she would start an organization and speak out about her
case, seeking to educate people who had felony convictions about their
right to vote. "I wasn't able to register people to vote, but I was able
to speak and tell people and share my story," she said. "I had my kids
and family registering people to vote."

After she left prison, she started an organization called [Crystal Mason
The Fight](https://www.crystalmasonthefight.org/). She and her children
go to fairs and other events to register people to vote. Recently, Mason
said, she was at an Autozone. She began speaking with the man who was
helping her and asked him if he was registered to vote. He said he
wasn't because he had a felony conviction seven or eight years ago.
Mason said he was surprised to learn there was a possibility that he
could vote again if he was done with his sentence.

"We need to be educated from state to state," Mason said. "That's what I
want to do -- I want to outreach and reach out to people that are
eligible to vote and let them know they have that right to vote."

The district attorney's decision to appeal Mason's case in April was an
odd one.

In 2020, the second court of criminal appeals had given prosecutors a
major victory when it upheld Mason's conviction. The panel said that
what mattered was not whether Mason knew she was ineligible to vote, but
whether she was on supervised release.

"Contrary to Mason's assertion, the fact that she did not know she was
legally ineligible to vote was irrelevant to her prosecution," Justice
Wade Birdwell wrote for the panel. Even though Mason may not have known
for sure whether she could vote, the fact that she signed anyway showed
that she affirmed her eligibility.

In 2022, the Texas court of criminal appeals, the highest court in
Texas, reversed that decision -- the first legal victory for Mason in
five years. The court said there was not enough evidence that Mason
"actually realized" she could not vote, prompting her acquittal two
years later in March.

Worth, Texas. Photograph: Desiree Rios/AP*

Mason's lawyers weren't really expecting an appeal. The Texas court of
criminal appeals had already signaled its skepticism of the case. The
original prosecutor who indicted Mason, a Republican named Sharen
Wilson, had retired and it wasn't clear that the new district attorney,
Republican Phil Sorrels, would want to get tied up in the case. "This is
not the kind of opinion you appeal," Grinter, Mason's attorney, said in
April.

A Sorrels spokeswoman did not respond to an interview request. But when
he appealed the decision in April, he said in a statement that the
appellate court had wrongly weighed the evidence in Mason's favor. On 8
May, he said publicly that he was appealing the case to send a message.

"I want would-be illegal voters to know that we're watching," Sorrells
said. "We'll follow the law and we would prosecute illegal voting," he
told county commissioners at a briefing that Mason attended, [according
to the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/politics/elections/new-election-integrity-task-force-tarrant-county/287-84c0a3f5-d800-4e21-8460-e1c25b116e2e).

In 2022, Mason decided to vote again. Her federal supervised release had
expired, and since the illegal voting charge was still under appeal, her
lawyers told her she could vote. "It was more personal, and more
important to me," she said. Mason said she had met a woman, a local
county commissioner, who had told her her story inspired her to run for
office.

Cole, one of Mason's lawyers, praised her client's political
transformation, but also said it was an unlikely story. "Can you imagine
the expense that someone would have had to bear had they just been doing
this on their own?" she said. "You just don't have the muscle to fight."

A few weeks later, when the state announced it was appealing the case,
Mason expressed exasperation in a text message. "I just don't
understand," she wrote.

"My heart is very, very heavy right now," she said. "I'm truly
sadden\[ed\] at this moment that the state in this upcoming election is
still sending a message."

LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge:

Seven of the so-called "D.C. Nine" bring this joint appeal from
convictions arising out of their unconsented entry into the Washington
offices of the Dow Chemical Company, and their destruction of certain
property therein. Appellants,[^20] along with two other defendants who
subsequently entered pleas of nolo contendere, were tried before
District Judge John H. Pratt and a jury on a three count indictment
alleging, as to each defendant, one count of second degree burglary, 22
D.C.Code § 1801(b), and two counts of malicious destruction of property
valued in excess of \$100, 22 D.C.Code § 403. On February 11, 1970,
after a six-day trial, the seven were each convicted of two counts of
malicious destruction. The jury acquitted on the burglary charges but
convicted on the lesser-included offense of unlawful entry. The
sentences imposed are set forth in the margin.

coerced the jury into delivering a verdict of guilty. **\[ ... \]**

I. *The Record in District Court*

The undisputed evidence showed that on Saturday, March 22, 1969,
appellants broke into the locked fourth floor Dow offices at 1030 - 15th
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., threw papers and documents about the
office and into the street below, vandalized office furniture and
equipment, and defaced the premises by spilling about a bloodlike
substance. The prosecution proved its case through Dow employees who
testified as to the lack of permission and extent of damage, members of
the news media who had been summoned to the scene by the appellants and
who witnessed the destruction while recording it photographically, and
police officers who arrested appellants on the scene.

Initially, the court appointed separate counsel for each defendant.
Following their arraignment on June 20, 1969, all save appellant Robert
Begin elected interim joint representation by Philip Hirschkop, Addison
Bowman and Caroline Nickerson. Mr. Begin was represented by Edward
Bennett Williams. All attorneys were court-appointed.

At the pre-trial conference held on January 29, 1970, in his chambers,
Judge Pratt indicated he had received a letter from Mr. Hirschkop to the
effect that appellants Jo Ann Malone, Arthur Melville, and Joseph
O'Rourke no longer wished to be represented by counsel. On his own
behalf, appellant Begin had written the Court requesting that the
appointment of Mr. Williams be terminated, and that he be permitted a
*pro se* defense. **\[ ... \]**

At the February 3, 1970, hearing on the *pro se* motions, the four
original movants were joined by appellant Dougherty. For approximately
three-quarters of an hour the court heard from the five defendants and
from their lawyers. The judge showed particular interest in the
defendants' education, and specifically whether any of the five had had
formal legal training. None had, although appellant Begin asserted he
had "taken pains to familiarize (himself) with courtroom procedure." In
general, the testimony showed that the five movants were quite
articulate and highly educated. It also appeared that all five movants
--- indeed all defendants save appellant Slaski --- were associated with
a religious order, either at that time or in the recent past and, in
varying degrees, had been active in work among the poor and
underprivileged, in this country and in Latin America.

After a brief recess, the court denied defendants' motions in an oral
opinion, set forth in the margin.[^21] **\[ ... \]**

The trial formally began on the afternoon of February 4. Judge Pratt
required that motions, objections, and examination of witnesses be made
through counsel. He did, however, agree to permit each defendant to make
a five minute opening statement and to testify, in narrative form, at
reasonable length without a specific time limit. After the prosecution's
opening statement, Mr. Hirschkop made a brief statement on behalf of all
defendants. Then five of the defendants --- including appellants
Dougherty, Begin and Arthur Melville--- made opening statements.

The prosecution's case was completed by the end of the next day,
February 5. Prior to the opening of the defense case, defendants
Catherine Melville and Bernard Meyer entered pleas of *nolo contendere*
to one count of malicious destruction of property; the remaining charges
were dismissed; and they are not before us on this appeal.

On Friday, February 6, after an opening statement by Mr. Bowman,
appellants O'Rourke and Malone made opening statements on their own
behalf, as the other defendants had done prior to the Government's case.
They directed their remarks, as had the others, to an attack on the role
of Dow Chemical Company and other unspecified corporations in supporting
American military efforts in the Vietnam War. When Sister Malone
referred to Vietnam, Judge Pratt interjected: "the war in Vietnam is not
an issue in this case." A disruption ensued. Events happened too quickly
for the court reporter to provide a complete record. The court later
inserted this description of what happened, Supplement to Transcript, p.
595:

> The record being unclear as to what transpired in the courtroom
> shortly before the Court adjourned Friday, February 6, 1970, the
> following is a recital of those events.
>
> Defendant Jo Ann Malone, while making her opening statement, referred
> to the Vietnam War. (T. 594) The Court ruled that "the War in Vietnam
> is not an issue in this case." (T. 594) Defendant Arthur Melville rose
> to object and was ordered by the Court to be seated. Defendant Michael
> Slaski also objected and when he failed to obey the Court's order to
> be seated, the Marshals were ordered to seat him. (T. 595) While this
> was taking place, two spectators in the rear of the courtroom then
> stood and shouted to the bench concerning the relevancy of the War in
> the case on trial. Marshals moved to eject these two persons. The
> first was removed without inci.dent. While the second was being
> ejected with some difficulty, a woman member of the DC-Nine Defense
> Committee seated in the front row in back of the defendants rose and
> ran to the back of the courtroom to impede the Marshals and assist the
> two spectators being removed. When the Marshals resisted her, she
> screamed at them. Defendant Michael Slaski then wrestled free from the
> Marshals who were attempting to seat him, hurdled the rail and engaged
> in an altercation with the Marshals at the rear of the courtroom.
> During these events the jury was ushered from the courtroom. The Court
> ordered the courtroom cleared and took a recess. It is reported that
> the fighting involving defendant Slaski ceased after two or three
> minutes and the Marshals began clearing the courtroom amid shouts of
> "pigs" and obscenities. Loud shouting occurred during the entire
> incident. A number of spectators refused to leave the courtroom and
> had to be ejected forcibly. The Court returned after the courtroom had
> been cleared and the press, counsel and the defendants had been
> readmitted. The jury was recalled, admonished to disregard what it had
> seen, and sent home. The Court then adjourned until Monday, February
> 9, 1970.

When the trial resumed on Monday, February 9, defendant Slaski was cited
for contempt for his role in the disturbances and the judge sternly
admonished the spectators and remaining defendants against further
outbreaks. Appellants Slaski and Moloney did not make opening
statements. After appellant Malone finished her statement, the case for
the defense began. It consisted entirely of defendants' testimony.
Appellants Arthur Melville, O'Rourke, Malone and Begin testified. During
the testimony there were several further disruptions requiring a brief
recess at one point and ejection of a spectator from the courtroom at
another. The judge confined closing argument to counsel. He instructed
the jury on the three counts of each indictment as well as on the
lesser-induded offense of unlawful entry under the burglary count. He
refused to instruct the jury that it could disregard the law as he gave
it to them, and refused to instruct the jury that "moral compulsion" or
"choice of the lesser evil" constituted a legal defense.

**\[ ... \]**

III\. *The Issue of Jury Nullification*

Our reference to the "intensity" factor underlying the *pro se* right
should not be understood as embracing the principle of "nullification"
proffered by appellants. They say that the jury has a well-recognized
prerogative to disregard the instructions of the court even as to
matters of law, and that they accordingly have the legal right that the
jury be informed of its power. We turn to this matter in order to define
the nature of the new trial permitted by our mandate.

There has evolved in the Anglo-American system an undoubted jury
prerogative-in-fact, derived from its power to bring in a general
verdict of not guilty in a criminal case, that is not reversible by the
court. The power of the courts to punish jurors for corrupt or incorrect
verdicts, which persisted after the medieval system of attaint by
another jury became obsolete, was repudiated in 1670 when Bushell's
Case, 124 Eng.Rep. 1006 (C.P. 1670) discharged the jurors who had
acquitted William Penn of unlawful assembly. Juries in civil cases
became subject to the control of ordering a new trial; no comparable
control evolved for acquittals in criminal cases.

The pages of history shine on instances of the jury's exercise of its
prerogative to disregard uncontradicted evidence and instructions of the
judge. Most often commended are the 18th century acquittal of Peter
Zenger of seditious libel, on the plea of Andrew Hamilton, and the 19th
century acquittals in prosecutions under the fugitive slave law. The
values involved drop a notch when the liberty vindicated by the verdict
relates to the defendant's shooting of his wife's paramour, or purchase
during Prohibition of alcoholic beverages.

Even the notable Dean Pound commented in 1910 on positive aspects of
"such jury lawlessness." These observations of history and philosophy
are underscored and illuminated, in terms of the current place of the
jury in the American system of justice, by the empirical information and
critical insights and analyses blended so felicitously in H. Kalven and
H. Zeisel, The American Jury.

Reflective opinions upholding the necessity for the jury as a protection
against arbitrary action, such as prosecutorial abuse of power, stress
fundamental features like the jury "common sense judgment" and assurance
of "community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence."
Human fraility being what it is, a prosecutor disposed by unworthy
motives could likely establish some basis in fact for bringing charges
against anyone he wants to book, but the jury system operates in fact,
(see note 33) so that the jury will not convict when they empathize with
the defendant, as when the offense is one they see themselves as likely
to commit, or consider generally acceptable or condonable under the
mores of the community.

The existence of an unreviewable and unreversible power in the jury, to
acquit in disregard of the instructions on the law given by the trial
judge, has for many years co-existed with legal practice and precedent
upholding instructions to the jury that they are required to follow the
instructions of the court on all matters of law. There were different
soundings in colonial days and the early days of our Republic. We are
aware of the number and variety of expressions at that time from
respected sources --- John Adams; Alexander Hamilton; prominent judges
--- that jurors had a duty to find a verdict according to their own
conscience, though in opposition to the direction of the court; that
their power signified a right; that they were judges both of law and of
fact in a criminal case, and not bound by the opinion of the court.

The rulings did not run all one way, but rather precipitated "a number
of classic exchanges on the freedom and obligations of the criminal
jury." This was, indeed, one of the points of clash between the
contending forces staking out the direction of the government of the
newly established Republic, a direction resolved in political terms by
reforming but sustaining the status of the courts, without radical
change. As the distrust of judges appointed and removable by the king
receded, there came increasing acceptance that under a republic the
protection of citizens lay not in recognizing the right of each jury to
make its own law, but in following democratic processes for changing the
law.

**\[ ... \]**

the Supreme Court settled the matter for the Federal courts in Sparf v.
United States, 156 U.S. 51, 102, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895) after
exhaustive review in both majority and dissenting opinions. The jury's
role was respected as significant and wholesome, but it was not to be
given instructions that articulated a right to do whatever it willed.
The old rule survives today only as a singular relic.

The breadth of the continuing prerogative of the jury, however,
perseveres, as appears from the rulings permitting inconsistent
verdicts. These reflect, in the words of Justice Holmes, an
acknowledgment that "the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the
teeth of both law and facts," or as Judge Learned Hand said: "We
interpret the acquittal as no more than their assumption of a power
which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed
through lenity."

Since the jury's prerogative of lenity, again in Learned Hand's words
*(supra,,* note 34) introduces a "slack into the enforcement of law,
tempering its rigor by the mollifying influence of current ethical
conventions," it is only just, say appellants, that the jurors be so
told. It is unjust to withhold information on the jury power of
"nullification," since conscientious jurors may come, ironically, to
abide by their oath as jurors to render verdicts offensive to their
individual conscience, to defer to an assumption of necessity that is
contrary to reality.

This so-called right of jury nullification is put forward in the name of
liberty and democracy, but its explicit avowal risks the ultimate logic
of anarchy. This is the concern voiced by Judge Sobeloff in United
States v. Moylan, 417 F.2d 1002, 1009 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397
U.S. 910, 90 S.Ct. 908, 25 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970):

> To encourage individuals to make their own determinations as to which
> laws they will obey and which they will permit themselves as a matter
> of conscience to disobey is to invite chaos. No legal system could
> long survive if it gave every individual the option of disregarding
> with impunity any law which by his personal standard was judged
> morally untenable. Toleration of such conduct would not be democratic,
> as appellants claim, but inevitably anarchic.

The statement that avowal of the jury's prerogative runs the risk of
anarchy, represents, in all likelihood, the habit of thought of
philosophy and logic, rather than the prediction of the social
scientist. But if the statement contains an element of hyperbole, the
existence of risk and danger, of significant magnitude, cannot be
gainsaid. In contrast, the advocates of jury "nullification" apparently
assume that the articulation of the jury's power will not extend its use
or extent, or will not do so significantly or obnoxiously. Can this
assumption fairly be made? We know that a posted limit of 60 m.p.h.
produces factual speeds 10 or even 15 miles greater, with an
understanding all around that some "tolerance" is acceptable to the
authorities, assuming conditions warrant. But can it be supposed that
the speeds would stay substantially the same if the speed limit were
put: Drive as fast as you think appropriate, without the posted .limit
as an anchor, a point of departure ?

Our jury system is a resultant of many vectors, some explicit, and some
rooted in tradition, continuity and general understanding without
express formulation. A constitution may be meaningful though it is
unwritten, as the British have proved for 900 years.

The jury system has worked out reasonably well overall, providing "play
in the joints" that imparts flexibility and avoid undue rigidity. An
equilibrium has evolved --- an often marvelous balance --- with the jury
acting as a "safety valve" for exceptional cases, without being a
wildcat or runaway institution. **\[ ... \]**

The way the jury operates may be radically altered if there is
alteration in the way it is told to operate. The jury knows well enough
that its prerogative is not limited to the choices articulated in the
formal instructions of the court. The jury gets its understanding as to
the arrangements in the legal system from more than one voice. There is
the formal communication from the judge. There is the informal
communication from the total ■ culture --- • literature (novel, drama,
film, and television); current comment (newspapers, magazines and
television); conversation; and, of course, history and tradition. The
totality of input generally convey adequately enough the idea of
prerogative, of freedom in an occasional case to depart from what the
judge says. Even indicators that would on their face seem too weak to
notice --- like the fact that the judge tells the jury it must acquit
(in case of reasonable doubt) but never tells the jury in so many words
that it must convict- --- are a meaningful part of the jury's total
input. Law is a system, and it is also a language, with secondary
meanings that may be unrecorded yet are part of its life.

**\[ ... \]**

to compel a juror involuntarily assigned to jury duty to assume the
burdens of mini-legislator or judge, as is implicit in the doctrine of
nullification, is to put untoward strains on the jury system. It is one
thing for a juror to know that the law condemns, but he has a factual
power of lenity. To tell him expressly of a nullification prerogative,
however, is to inform him, in effect, that it is he who fashions the
rule that condemns. That is an overwhelming responsibility, an extreme
burden for the jurors' psyche. And it is not inappropriate to add that a
juror called upon for an involuntary public service is entitled to the
protection, when he takes action that he knows is right, but also knows
is unpopular, either in the community at large or in his own particular
grouping, that he can fairly put it .to friends and neighbors that he
was merely following the instructions of the court.

In the last analysis, our rejection of the request for jury
nullification doctrine is a recognition that there are times when logic
is not the only or even best guide to sound conduct of government. For
machines, one can indulge the person who likes to tinker in pursuit of
fine tuning. When men and judicial machinery are involved, one must
attend to the many and complex mechanisms and reasons that lead men to
change their conduct --- when they know they are being studied; when
they are told of the consequences of their conduct; and when conduct
exercised with restraint as an unwritten exception is expressly
presented as a legitimate option.

What makes for health as an occasional medicine would be disastrous as a
daily diet. **\[ ... \]**

Finally, we are aware that the denial of defendants' request for a
nullification instruction will be considered by them to negative some,
or perhaps most, of the value of the right of *pro se* representation
which we have recognized. This point could be answered in terms of
logic: The right of self-representation is given for reasons recognized
by the law, and cannot be a springboard to establish the validity of
other advantages or conditions that lie in its tactical wake. Thus, a
defendant's ability to present his demeanor and often even a kind of
testimony, without exposure to impeachment or cross-examination, may be
a tactical consequence of *pro se* representation, and even a moving
cause of its invocation, but this is not to say it is an objective of
the law. But defendants' position merits a more spacious answer, that
lies outside the domain of formal logic. It is this. The jury system
provides flexibility for the consideration of interests of justice
outside the formal rules of law. This embraces whatever extra the
defendant conveys by personal representation, whether through demeanor
or sincerity of justification. But it is subject to the overriding
consideration that what is tolerable or even desirable as an informal,
self-initiated exception, harbors grave dangers to the system if it is
opened to expansion and intensification through incorporation in the
judge's instruction.

IV\. *The Jury Instructions*

Finally, defendants assert that one segment of the charge to the jury,
set forth in the margin, was coercive, tantamount to a directed verdict
of guilty, and outside the proper scope of a judicial instruction.

For the most part, defendants' real complaint seems to be that the court
stated the law applicable to the case. There is no contention --- apart
from the jury nullification claim, which we have rejected --- that the
charge was inaccurate as a statement of the applicable law. If a judge
is to instruct the jury on the ultimate facts that are material under
the law, he may properly advise the jury of what matters brought forward
by defendants are not material under the applicable rule of law --- as
surely as he may charge that voluntary intoxication is no defense to a
charge of second degree murder. Since it is the essence of the judicial
function to declare the applicable law, it follows that the mere
declaration of the law cannot be held outside the judicial function.
This is tautological, but it is often the part of wisdom to be able to
recognize which propositions are true tautologies. The jury were not
told they must bring in a guilty verdict nor was there the kind of
language or conduct, going beyond a declaration of the applicable law,
that has in other cases been held coercive, and an imroper departure
from the role of the judge.

**\[ ... \]**

BAZELON, Chief Judge,

concurring in part and dissenting in part:

**\[ ... \]**

My disagreement with the Court concerns the issue of jury nullification.
As the Court's opinion clearly acknowledges, there can be no doubt that
the jury has "an unreviewable and unreversible power \* \* \* to acquit
in disregard of the instructions on the law given by the trial judge \*
\* Majority opinion at 1132. More important, the Court apparently
concedes --- although in somewhat grudging terms --- that the power of
nullification is a "necessary counter to case-hardened judges and
arbitrary prosecutors," and that exercise of the power may, in at least
some instances, "enhance, the over-all normative effect of the rule of
law." *Id.* at 1137. We could not withhold that concession without
scoffing at the rationale that underlies the right to jury trial in
criminal eases, and belittling some of the most legendary episodes in
our political and jurisprudential history.

The sticking point, however, is whether or not the jury should be told
of its power to nullify the law in a particular case. Here, the trial
judge not only denied a requested instruction on nullification, but also
barred defense counsel from raising the issue in argument before the
jury. The majority affirms that ruling. I see no justification for, and
considerable harm in, this deliberate lack of candor.

At trial, the defendants made no effort to deny that they had committed
the acts charged. Their defense was designed to persuade the jury that
it would be unconscionable to convict them of violating a statute whose
general validity and applicability they did not challenge. An
instruction on nullification --- or at least some argument to the jury
on that issue --- was, therefore, the linchpin of the defense.

At the outset it is important to recognize that the trial judge was not
simply neutral on the question of nullification. His instruction, set
out in part in the margin,[^22] emphatically denied the existence of a
"legal defense" based on "sincere religious motives" or a belief that
action was justified by "some higher law." That charge was not directly
inconsistent with the theory of jury nullification. Nullification is not
a "defense" recognized by law, but rather a mechanism that permits a
jury, as community conscience, to disregard the strict requirements of
law where it finds that those requirements cannot justly be applied in a
particular case. Yet the impact of the judge's instruction, whatever his
intention, was almost surely to discourage the jury from measuring the
defendants' action against community concepts of blameworthiness.

Thus, we are left with a doctrine that may "enhance the over-all
normative effect of the rule of law," but, at the same time, one that
must not only be concealed from the jury, but also effectively condemned
in the jury's presence. Plainly, the justification for this
sleight-of-hand lies in a fear that an occasionally noble doctrine will,
if acknowledged, often be put to ignoble and abusive purposes --- or, to
borrow the Court's phrase, will "run the risk of anarchy." Majority
opinion at 1134. A breakdown of the legal order is not a result I would
knowingly encourage or enjoy. But the question cannot be resolved, at
least at this stage of the argument, by asking if we are for or against
anarchy, or if we are willing to tolerate a little less law and order so
that we can permit a little more jury nullification. No matter how
horrible the effect feared by the Court, the validity of its reasoning
depends on the existence of a demonstrable connection between the
alleged cause (a jury nullification instruction or argument to the jury
on that issue) and that effect. I am unable to see a connection.

**\[ ... \]**

My own view rests on the premise that nullification can and should serve
an important function in the criminal process. I do not see it as a
doctrine that exists only because we lack the power to punish jurors who
refuse to enforce the law or to re-prosecute a defendant whose acquittal
cannot be justified in the strict terms of law. The doctrine permits the
jury to bring to bear on the criminal process- a sense of fairness and
particularized justice. The drafters of legal rules cannot anticipate
and take account of every case where a defendant's conduct is
"unlawful\" but not blameworthy, any more than they can draw a bold line
to mark the boundary between an accident and negligence. It is the jury
--- as spokesman for the community's sense of values --- that must
explore that subtle and elusive boundary.

**\[ ... \]**

The very essence of the jury's function is its role as spokesman for the
community conscience in determining whether or not blame can be imposed.

I do not see any reason to assume that jurors will make rampantly
abusive use of their power. Trust in the jury is, after all, one of the
cornerstones of our entire criminal jurisprudence, and if that trust is
without foundation we must re-examine a great deal more than just the
nullification doctrine. Nevertheless, some abuse can be anticipated. If
a jury refuses to apply strictly the controlling principles of law, it
may --- in conflict with values shared by the larger community ---
convict a defendant because of prejudice against him, or acquit a
defendant because of sympathy for him and prejudice against his victim.
Our fear of unjust conviction is plainly understandable. But it is hard
for me to see how a nullification instruction could enhance the
likelihood of that result. The instruction would speak in terms of
acquittal, not conviction, and it would provide no comfort to a juror
determined to convict a defendant in defiance of the law or the facts of
the ease. Indeed, unless the jurors *ignored* the nullification
instruction they could not convict on the grounds of prejudice alone.
Does the judge's recitation of the instruction increase the likelihood
that the jury will ignore the limitation that lies at its heart ? I
hardly think so.

**\[ ... \]**

On remand the trial judge should grant defendants' request for a
nullification instruction. At the very least, I would require the trial
court to permit defendants to argue the question before the jury. But it
is not at all clear that defendants would prevail even with the aid of
an instruction or argument. After all, this ease is significantly
different from the classic, exalted cases where juries historically
invoked the power to nullify. Here, the defendants have no quarrel with
the general validity of the law under which they have been charged. They
did not simply refuse to obey a government edict that they considered
illegal, and whose illegality they expected to demonstrate in a judicial
proceeding. Rather, they attempted to protest government action by
interfering with others --- specifically, the Dow Chemical Company. This
is a distinction which could and should be explored in argument before
the jury. If revulsion against the war in Southeast Asia has reached a
point where a jury would be unwilling to convict a defendant for
commission of the acts alleged here, we would be far better advised to
ponder the implications of that result than to spend our time devising
stratagems which let us pretend that the power of nullification does not
even exist.

Paul Butler on Race-Based Jury Nullification

 

This is an excerpt from Paul Butler, [Racially Based Jury Nullification:
Black Power in the Criminal Justice System]{.underline}, 105 Yale L.J.
677 (1995)

 

I was a Special Assistant United States Attorney in the District of
Columbia in 1990. I prosecuted people accused of misdemeanor crimes,
mainly the drug and gun cases that overwhelm the local courts of most
American cities. As a federal prosecutor, I represented the United
States of America and used that power to put people, mainly
African-American men, in prison. I am also an African-American man.
While at the U.S. Attorney\'s office, I made two discoveries that
profoundly changed the way I viewed my work as a prosecutor and my
responsibilities as a black person.

The first discovery occurred during a training session for new
Assistants conducted by experienced prosecutors. We rookies were
informed that we would lose many of our cases, despite having persuaded
a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty. We would
lose because some black jurors would refuse to convict black defendants
who they knew were guilty.

The second discovery was related to the first, but was even more
unsettling. It occurred during the trial of Marion Barry, then the
second-term mayor of the District of Columbia. Barry was being
prosecuted by my office for drug possession and perjury. I learned, to
my surprise, that some of my fellow African-American prosecutors hoped
that the mayor would be acquitted, despite the fact that he was
obviously guilty of at least one of the charges\--he had smoked cocaine
on FBI videotape. These black prosecutors wanted their office to lose
its case because they believed that the prosecution of Barry was racist.

Federal prosecutors in the nation\'s capital hear many rumors about
prominent officials engaging in illegal conduct, including drug use.
Some African-American prosecutors wondered why, of all those people, the
government chose to "set up" the most famous black politician in
Washington, D.C. They also asked themselves why, if crack is so
dangerous, the FBI had allowed the mayor to smoke it. Some members of
the predominantly black jury must have had similar concerns: They
convicted the mayor of only one count of a fourteen-count indictment,
despite the trial judge\'s assessment that he had "'never seen a
stronger government case."' Some African-American prosecutors thought
that the jury, in rendering its verdict, jabbed its black thumb in the
face of a racist prosecution, and that idea made those prosecutors glad.

As such reactions suggest, lawyers and judges increasingly perceive that
some African-American jurors vote to acquit black defendants for racial
reasons, a decision sometimes expressed as the juror\'s desire not to
send yet another black man to jail. This Essay examines the question of
what role race should play in black jurors\' decisions to acquit
defendants in criminal cases. Specifically, I consider trials that
include both African-American defendants and African-American jurors. I
argue that the race of a black defendant is sometimes a legally and
morally appropriate factor for jurors to consider in reaching a verdict
of not guilty or for an individual juror to consider in refusing to vote
for conviction.

My thesis is that, for pragmatic and political reasons, the black
community is better off when some nonviolent lawbreakers remain in the
community rather than go to prison. The decision as to what kind of
conduct by African-Americans ought to be punished is better made by
African-Americans themselves, based on the costs and benefits to their
community, than by the traditional criminal justice process, which is
controlled by white lawmakers and white law enforcers.

..

Considering the costs of law enforcement to the black community and the
failure of white lawmakers to devise significant nonincarcerative
responses to black antisocial conduct, it is the moral responsibility of
black jurors to emancipate some guilty black outlaws.

My goal is the subversion of American criminal justice, at least as it
now exists. Through jury nullification, I want to dismantle the
master\'s house with the master\'s tools. My intent, however, is not
purely destructive; this project is also constructive, because I hope
that the destruction of the status quo will not lead to anarchy, but
rather to the implementation of certain noncriminal ways of addressing
antisocial conduct. Criminal conduct among African-Americans is often a
predictable reaction to oppression. Sometimes black crime is a symptom
of internalized white supremacy; other times it is a reasonable response
to the racial and economic subordination every African-American faces
every day. Punishing black people for the fruits of racism is wrong if
that punishment is premised on the idea that it is the black criminal\'s
"just deserts." Hence, the new paradigm of justice that I suggest in
rejects punishment for the sake of retribution and endorses it, with
qualifications, for the ends of deterrence and incapacitation.

..

According to \[some writers\], whom I will call law enforcement
enthusiasts, the criminal law may have a disproportionate impact on the
black community, but this is not a moral or racial issue because the
disproportionate impact is the law\'s effect, not its intent. For law
enforcement enthusiasts, intent is the most appropriate barometer of
governmental racism. Because law enforcement is a public good, it is in
the best interest of the black community to have more, rather than less,
of it. Allowing criminals to live unfettered in the community would
harm, in particular, the black poor, who are disproportionately the
victims of violent crime. Indeed, the logical conclusion of the
enthusiasts\' argument is that African-Americans would be better off
with more, not fewer, black criminals behind bars.

To my mind, the enthusiasts embrace law enforcement too uncritically:
They are blind to its opportunity costs. I agree that criminal law
enforcement constitutes a public good for African-Americans when it
serves the social protection goals . . . . But what about when locking
up a black man has no or little net effect on public safety, when, for
example, the crime with which he was charged is victimless? Putting
aside for a moment the legal implications, couldn\'t an analysis of the
costs and benefits to the African-American community present an argument
against incarceration? I argue "yes," in light of the substantial costs
to the community of law enforcement. I accept that other reasonable
people may disagree. But the law enforcement enthusiasts seldom
acknowledge that racial critics even weigh the costs and benefits; their
assumption seems to be that the racial critics are foolish or blinded by
history or motivated by their own ethnocentrism.

..

The very fact that a black person can be on a jury is evidence that the
criminal justice system is one in which black people should have
confidence, and one that they should respect.

But what of the black juror who endorses racial critiques of American
criminal justice? Such a person holds no "confidence in the integrity of
the criminal justice system." If she is cognizant of the implicit
message that the Supreme Court believes her presence sends, she might
not want her presence to be the vehicle for that message. Let us assume
that there is a black defendant who, the evidence suggests, is guilty of
the crime with which he has been charged, and a black juror who thinks
that there are too many black men in prison. The black juror has two
choices: She can vote for conviction, thus sending another black man to
prison and implicitly allowing her presence to support public confidence
in the system that puts him there, or she can vote "not guilty," thereby
acquitting the defendant, or at least causing a mistrial. In choosing
the latter, the juror makes a decision not to be a passive symbol of
support for a system for which she has no respect. Rather than signaling
her displeasure with the system by breaching "community peace," the
black juror invokes the political nature of her role in the criminal
justice system and votes "no." In a sense, the black juror engages in an
act of civil disobedience, except that her choice is better than civil
disobedience because it is lawful. Is the black juror\'s race-conscious
act moral? Absolutely. It would be farcical for her to be the sole
color-blind actor in the criminal process, especially when it is her
blackness that advertises the system\'s fairness.

At this point, every African-American should ask herself whether the
operation of the criminal law in the United States advances the
interests of black people. If it does not, the doctrine of jury
nullification affords African-American jurors the opportunity to control
the authority of the law over some African-American criminal defendants.
In essence, black people can "opt out" of American criminal law.

..

In cases involving violent *malum in se* crimes like murder, rape, and
assault, jurors should consider the case strictly on the evidence
presented, and, if they have no reasonable doubt that the defendant is
guilty, they should convict. For nonviolent *malum in se* crimes such as
theft or perjury, nullification is an option that the juror should
consider, although there should be no presumption in favor of it. A
juror might vote for acquittal, for example, when a poor woman steals
from Tiffany\'s, but not when the same woman steals from her next-door
neighbor. Finally, in cases involving nonviolent, *malum prohibitum*
offenses, including "victimless" crimes like narcotics offenses, there
should be a presumption in favor of nullification.

Bordenkircher v. Hayes

 

**\[ ... \]**

**Don BORDENKIRCHER, Superintendent, Kentucky State Penitentiary,
Petitioner,**

**v.**

**Paul Lewis HAYES.**

**\[ ... \]**

Argued Nov. 9, 1977.

Decided Jan. 18, 1978.

**\[ ... \]**

           Mr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.

          The question in this case is whether the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a state prosecutor carries out
a threat made during plea negotiations to reindict the accused on more
serious charges if he does not plead guilty to the offense with which he
was originally charged.

I

          The respondent, Paul Lewis Hayes, was indicted by a **\[ ...
\]** grand jury on a charge of uttering a forged instrument in the
amount of \$88.30, an offense then punishable by a term of 2 to 10 years
in prison. **\[ ... \]** After arraignment, Hayes, his retained counsel,
and the Commonwealth\'s Attorney met in the presence of the Clerk of the
Court to discuss a possible plea agreement. During these conferences the
prosecutor offered to recommend a sentence of five years in prison if
Hayes would plead guilty to the indictment. He also said that if Hayes
did not plead guilty and \"save\[d\] the court the inconvenience and
necessity of a trial,\" he would return to the grand jury to seek an
indictment under the Kentucky Habitual Criminal Act,^1^ **\[ ...
\]**repealed 1975), which would subject Hayes to a mandatory sentence of

**\[ ... \]**

life imprisonment by reason of his two prior felony convictions.^2^
Hayes chose not to plead guilty, and the prosecutor did obtain an
indictment charging him under the Habitual Criminal Act. It is not
disputed that the recidivist charge was fully justified by the evidence,
that the pros cutor was in possession of this evidence at the time of
the original indictment, and that Hayes\' refusal to plead guilty to the
original charge was what led to his indictment under the habitual
criminal statute.

          A jury found Hayes guilty on the principal charge of uttering
a forged instrument and, in a separate proceeding, further found that he
had twice before been convicted of felonies. As required by the habitual
offender statute, he was sentenced to a life term in the penitentiary.
**\[ ... \]**

IV

          This Court held in *North Carolina v. Pearce***\[ ... \]**,
that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \"requires that
vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his
first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a
new trial.\" **\[ ... \]**

            To punish a person because he has done what the law plainly
allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort**\[
... \]** and for an agent of the State to pursue a course of action
whose objective is to penalize a person\'s reliance on his legal rights
is \"patently unconstitutional.\" ***\[ ... \]*** But in the
\"give-and-take\" of plea bargaining, there is no such element of
punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or
reject the prosecution\'s offer.

          Plea bargaining flows from \"the mutuality of advantage\" to
defendants and prosecutors, each with his own reasons for wanting to
avoid trial. ***\[ ... \]***Defendants advised by competent counsel and
protected by other procedural safeguards are presumptively capable of
intelligent choice in response to prosecutorial persuasion**\[ ... \]**.
By hypothesis, the plea may have been induced by promises of a
recommendation of a lenient sentence or a reduction of charges, and thus
by fear of the possibility of a greater penalty upon conviction after a
trial. See ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of
Guilty § 3.1 (App. Draft 1968);

**\[ ... \]**

            While confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe
punishment clearly may have a \"discouraging effect on the defendant\'s
assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices
\[is\] an inevitable\"---and permissible---\"attribute of any legitimate
system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\" ***\[
... \]*** It follows that, by tolerating and encouraging the negotiation
of pleas, this Court has necessarily accepted as constitutionally
legitimate the simple reality that the prosecutor\'s interest at the
bargaining table is to persuade the defendant to forgo his right to
plead not guilty.

**\[ ... \]** In our system, so long as the prosecutor has probable
cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by
statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to
file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely in his
discretion.^8^ Within the limits set by the legislature\'s
constitutionally valid definition of chargeable offenses, \"the
conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a
federal constitutional violation\" so long as \"the selection was
\[not\] deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race,
religion, or other arbitrary classification.\" ***\[ ... \]***To hold
that the prosecutor\'s desire to induce a guilty plea is an
\"unjustifiable standard,\" which, like race or religion,

Page 365

may play no part in his charging decision, would contradict the very
premises that underlie the concept of plea bargaining itself. Moreover,
a rigid constitutional rule that would prohibit a prosecutor from acting
forthrightly in his dealings with the defense could only invite
unhealthy subterfuge that would drive the practice of plea bargaining
back into the shadows from which it has so recently emerged. **\[ ...
\]**

          There is no doubt that the breadth of discretion that our
country\'s legal system vests in prosecuting attorneys carries with it
the potential for both individual and institutional abuse.^9^ And broad
though that discretion may be, there are undoubtedly constitutional
limits upon its exercise. We hold only that the course of conduct
engaged in by the prosecutor in this case, which no more than openly
presented the defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing
trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution,
did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

**\[ ... \]**

           Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr.
Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

          It might be argued that it really makes little difference how
this case, now that it is here, is decided. The Court\'s holding gives
plea bargaining full sway despite vindictiveness. A contrary result,
however, merely would prompt the aggressive prosecutor to bring the
greater charge initially in every case, and only thereafter to bargain.
The consequences to the accused would still be adverse, for then he
would bargain against a greater charge, face the likelihood of increased
bail, and run the risk that the court would be less inclined to accept a
bargained plea. Nonetheless, it is far preferable to hold the
prosecution to the charge it was originally content to bring and to
justify in the eyes of its public.^2^

           Mr. Justice POWELL, dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

          It seems to me that the question to be asked under the
circumstances is whether the prosecutor reasonably might have charged
respondent under the Habitual Criminal Act in the first place. The
deference that courts properly accord the

**\[ ... \]**

exercise of a prosecutor\'s discretion perhaps would foreclose judicial
criticism if the prosecutor originally had sought an indictment under
that Act, as unreasonable as it would have seemed.^2^ But here the
prosecutor evidently made a reasonable, responsible judgment not to
subject an individual to a mandatory life sentence when his only new
offense had societal implications as limited as those accompanying the
uttering of a single \$88 forged check and when the circumstances of his
prior convictions confirmed the inappropriateness of applying the
habitual criminal statute.^3^ I think it may be inferred that the
prosecutor himself deemed it unreasonable and not in the public interest
to put this defendant in jeopardy of a sentence of life imprisonment.

   **\[ ... \]**

          The plea-bargaining process, as recognized by this Court, is
essential to the functioning of the criminal-justice system. It normally
affords genuine benefits to defendants as well as to society. And if the
system is to work effectively, prosecutors must be accorded the widest
discretion, within constitutional limits, in conducting bargaining. **\[
... \]** In this case, the prosecutor\'s actions denied respondent due

**\[ ... \]**

process because their admitted purpose was to discourage and then to
penalize with unique severity his exercise of constitutional rights.
Implementation of a strategy calculated solely to deter the exercise of
constitutional rights is not a constitutionally permissible exercise of
discretion. **\[ ... \]**

^1.\ While\ cross-examining\ Hayes\ during\ the\ subsequent\ trial\ proceedings\ the\ prosecutor\ described\ the\ plea\ offer\ in\ the\ following\ language:^

\"Isn\'t it a fact that I told you at that time \[the initial bargaining
session\] if you did not intend to plead guilty to five years for this
charge and . . . save the court the inconvenience and necessity of a
trial and taking up this time that I intended to return to the grand
jury and ask them to indict you based upon these prior felony
convictions?\" Tr. 194.

^2.^ At the time of Hayes\' trial the statute provided that \"\[a\]ny
person convicted a . . . third time of felony . . . shall be confined in
the penitentiary during his life.\" Ky.Rev.Stat. § 431.190 (1973)
(repealed 1975). That statute has been replaced by Ky.Rev.Stat. §
532.080 (Supp. 1977) under which Hayes would have been sentenced to, at
most, an indeterminate term of 10 to 20 years. § 532.080(6)(b). In
addition, under the new statute a previous conviction is a basis for
enhanced sentencing only if a prison term of one year or more was
imposed, the sentence or probation was completed within five years of
the present offense, and the offender was over the age of 18 when the
offense was committed. At least one of Hayes\' prior convictions did not
meet these conditions. See n. 3, *infra*.

**^\[\ ...\ \]^**

^8.^ This case does not involve the constitutional implications of a
prosecutor\'s offer during plea bargaining of adverse or lenient
treatment for some person *other* than the accused, see ALI Model Code
of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Commentary to § 350.3, pp. 614-615 (1975),
which might pose a greater danger of inducing a false guilty plea by
skewing the assessment of the risks a defendant must consider. Cf.
*Brady v. United States*, 397 U.S. 742, 758, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1474, 25
L.Ed.2d 747.

^9.^ This potential has led to many recommendations that the
prosecutor\'s discretion should be controlled by means of either
internal or external guidelines. See ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment
Procedure for Criminal Justice §§ 350.3(2)-(3) (1975); ABA Project on
Standards for Criminal Justice, The Prosecution Function §§ 2.5, 3.9
(App. Draft 1971); Abrahms, Internal Policy: Guiding the Exercise of
Prosecutorial Discretion, 19 UCLA L.Rev. 1 (1971).

**^\[\ ...\ \]^**

^2.^ That prosecutors, without saying so, may sometimes bring charges
more serious than they think appropriate for the ultimate disposition of
a case, in order to gain bargaining leverage with a defendant, does not
add support to today\'s decision, for this Court, in its approval of the
advantages to be gained from plea negotiations, has never openly
sanctioned such deliberate overcharging or taken such a cynical view of
the bargaining process. See *North Carolina v. Alford*, 400 U.S. 25, 91
S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); *Santobello v. New York*, 404 U.S.
257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Normally, of course, it is
impossible to show that this is what the prosecutor is doing, and the
courts necessarily have deferred to the prosecutor\'s exercise of
discretion in initial charging decisions.

Even if overcharging is to be sanctioned, there are strong reasons of
fairness why the charges should be presented at the beginning of the
bargaining process, rather than as a filliped threat at the end. First,
it means that a prosecutor is required to reach a charging decision
without

any knowledge of the particular defendant\'s willingness to plead
guilty; hence the defendant who truly believes himself to be innocent,
and wishes for that reason to go to trial, is not likely to be subject
to quite such a devastating gamble since the prosecutor has fixed the
incentives for the average case.

Second, it is healthful to keep charging practices visible to the
general public, so that political bodies can judge whether the policy
being followed is a fair one. Visibility is enhanced if the prosecutor
is required to lay his cards on the table with an indictment of public
record at the beginning of the bargaining process, rather than making
use of unrecorded verbal warnings of more serious indictments yet to
come.

Finally, I would question whether it is fair to pressure defendants to
plead guilty by threat of reindictment on an enhanced charge for the
same conduct when the defendant has no way of knowing whether the
prosecutor would indeed be entitled to bring him to trial on the
enhanced charge. Here, though there is no dispute that respondent met
the then-current definition of a habitual offender under Kentucky law,
it is conceivable that a properly instructed Kentucky grand jury, in
response to the same considerations that ultimately moved the Kentucky
Legislature to amend the habitual offender statute, would have refused
to subject respondent to such an onerous penalty for his forgery charge.
There is no indication in the record that, once the new indictment was
obtained, respondent was gi en another chance to plead guilty to the
forged check charge in exchange for a five-year sentence.

**April 1, 1980.**

 

**\[ ... \]**

OPINION OF THE COURT

JASEN, Judge.

The significant issue on this appeal is whether the defendant, in a
murder prosecution, established the affirmative defense of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\" which would have reduced the crime to
manslaughter in the first degree.

On February 28, 1977, Victoria Lo Consolo was brutally murdered.
Defendant Victor Casassa and Miss Lo Consolo had been acquainted for
some time prior to the latter\'s tragic death. They met in August, 1976
as a result of their residence in the **\[ ... \]**same apartment
complex. Shortly thereafter, defendant asked Miss Lo Consolo to
accompany him to a social function and she agreed. The two apparently
dated casually on other occasions until November, 1976 when Miss Lo
Consolo informed defendant that she was not \"falling in love\" with
him. Defendant claims that Miss Lo Consolo\'s candid statement of her
feelings \"devastated him.\"

Miss Lo Consolo\'s rejection of defendant\'s advances also precipitated
a bizarre series of actions on the part of defendant which, he asserts,
demonstrate the existence of extreme emotional disturbance upon which he
predicates his affirmative defense. Defendant, aware that Miss Lo
Consolo maintained social relationships with others, broke into the
apartment below Miss Lo Consolo\'s on several occasions to eavesdrop.
These eavesdropping sessions allegedly caused him to be under great
emotional stress. Thereafter, on one occasion, he broke into Miss Lo
Consolo\'s apartment while she was out. Defendant took nothing, but,
instead, observed the apartment, disrobed and lay for a time in Miss Lo
Consolo\'s bed. During this break-in, defendant was armed with a knife
which, he later told police, he carried \"because he knew that he was
either going to hurt Victoria or Victoria was going to cause him to
commit suicide.\"

Defendant\'s final visit to his victim\'s apartment occurred on February
28, 1977. Defendant brought several bottles of wine and liquor with him
to offer as a gift. Upon Miss Lo Consolo\'s rejection of this offering,
defendant produced a steak knife which he had brought with him, stabbed
Miss Lo Consolo several times in the throat, dragged her body to the
bathroom and submerged it in a bathtub full of water to \"make sure she
was dead.\"

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**The defendant did not contest the underlying facts of the
crime. Instead, the sole issue presented to the trial court was whether
the defendant, at the time of the killing, had acted under the influence
of \"extreme emotional disturbance\". (Penal Law, § 125.25, subd. 1,
par. (a).) The defense presented only one witness, a psychiatrist, who
testified, in essence, that the defendant had become obsessed with Miss
Lo Consolo and that the course which their relationship had taken,
combined with several personality attributes peculiar to defendant,
caused him to be under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at
the time of the killing.

In rebuttal, the People produced several witnesses. Among these
witnesses was a psychiatrist who testified that although the defendant
was emotionally disturbed, he was not under the influence of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\" within the meaning of section 125.25 (subd. 1,
par. (a)) of the Penal Law because his disturbed state was not the
product of external factors but rather was \"a stress he created from
within himself, dealing mostly with a fantasy, a refusal to accept the
reality of the situation.\"

The trial court in resolving this issue noted that the affirmative
defense of extreme emotional disturbance may be based upon a series of
events, rather than a single precipitating cause. In order to be
entitled to the defense, the court held, a defendant must show that his
reaction to such events was reasonable. In determining whether
defendant\'s emotional reaction was reasonable, the court considered the
appropriate test to be whether in the totality of the circumstances the
finder of fact could understand how a person might have his reason
overcome. Concluding that the test was not to be applied solely from the
viewpoint of defendant, the court found that defendant\'s emotional
reaction at the time of the commission of the crime was so peculiar to
him that it could not be considered reasonable so as to reduce the
conviction to manslaughter in the first degree. Accordingly, the trial
court found defendant guilty of the crime of murder in the second
degree. The Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion.

On this appeal defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing
to afford him the benefit of the affirmative defense of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\". It is argued that the defendant established
that he suffered from a mental infirmity not arising to the level of
insanity which disoriented his reason to the extent that his emotional
reaction, from his own subjective point of view, was supported by a
reasonable explanation or excuse. Defendant asserts that by refusing to
apply a wholly subjective standard the trial court misconstrued section
125.25 (subd. 1, par. (a)) of the Penal Law. We cannot agree.

Section 125.25 (subd. 1, par. (a)) of the Penal Law provides that it is
an affirmative defense to the crime of murder in the second degree where
\"(t)he defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.\"
This defense allows a defendant charged with the commission of acts
which would otherwise constitute **\[ ... \]**murder to demonstrate the
existence of mitigating factors which indicate that, although he is not
free from responsibility for his crime, he ought to be punished less
severely by reducing the crime upon conviction to manslaughter in the
first degree. (Penal Law, § 125.25, subd. 1, par. (a); People v.
Patterson, 39 N.Y.2d 288, 302, 383 N.Y.S.2d 573, 347 N.E.2d 898, affd.
sub nom. Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d
281; see, also, Wechsler, Codification of Criminal Law in the United
States: The Model Penal Code, 68 Col.L.Rev. 1425, 1446.)

In enacting section 125.25 (subd. 1, par. (a)) of the Penal Law, the
Legislature adopted the language of the manslaughter provisions of the
Model Penal Code (see § 201.3, subd. (1), par. (b) (Tent Draft No. 9)).
The only substantial distinction between the New York statute and the
Model Penal Code is the designation by the Legislature of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\" as an \"affirmative defense\", thus placing the
burden of proof on this issue upon defendant. (Penal Law, § 25.00, subd.
2; People v. Patterson, 39 N.Y.2d 288, 301, 383 N.Y.S.2d 573, 347 N.E.2d
898, supra.) The Model Penal Code formulation, however, as enacted by
the Legislature, represented a significant departure from the prior law
of this State.

The \"extreme emotional disturbance\" defense is an outgrowth of the
\"heat of passion\" doctrine which had for some time been recognized by
New York as a distinguishing factor between the crimes of manslaughter
and murder. (See 1829 Rev.Stat. of New York, Part IV, ch. I, tit. II, §§
10, 12, 18; L.1881, ch. 676, § 189, subd. 2; § 193, subd. 2; Penal Law
of 1909, § 1052, subd. 2.) However, the new formulation is significantly
broader in scope than the \"heat of passion\" doctrine which it
replaced. (People v. Patterson, 39 N.Y.2d 288, 302-303, 383 N.Y.S.2d
573, 347 N.E.2d 898, supra; People v. Shelton, 88 Misc.2d 136, 141-142,
385 N.Y.S.2d 708; Notes of the Staff of the State Commission on Revision
of the Penal Law and Criminal Code, 1967 Gilbert, Criminal Law and
Practice of New York, pp. 1C-61-62; Model Penal Code, § 201.3, Comment,
pp. 46-47 (Tent Draft No. 9).)

For example, the \"heat of passion\" doctrine required that a
defendant\'s action be undertaken as a response to some provocation
which prevented him from reflecting upon his actions. (See, e. g.,
People v. Ferraro, 161 N.Y. 365, 375, 55 N.E. 931.) Moreover, such
reaction had to be immediate. The existence of a \"cooling off\" period
completely negated any mitigating effect which the provocation might
otherwise have had. (See, e. g., People v. Fiorentino, 197 N.Y. 560,
563, 91 N.E. 195.) In Patterson, however, this court recognized that
\"(a)n action influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance is not one
that is necessarily so spontaneously undertaken. Rather, it may be that
a significant mental trauma has affected a defendant\'s mind for a
substantial period of time, simmering in the unknowing subconscious and
then inexplicably coming to the fore.\" (39 N.Y.2d, at p. 303, 383
N.Y.S.2d at p. 582, 347 N.E.2d, at p. 908.) This distinction between the
past and present law of mitigation, enunciated in Patterson, was
expressly adopted by the trial court and properly applied in this case.

The thrust of defendant\'s claim, however, concerns a question arising
out of another perceived distinction between \"heat of passion\" and
\"extreme emotional disturbance\" which was not directly addressed in
Patterson, to wit: whether, assuming that the defense is applicable to a
broader range of circumstances, the standard by which the reasonableness
of defendant\'s emotional reaction is to be tested must be an entirely
subjective one. Defendant relies principally upon our decision in
Patterson and upon the language of the statute to support his claim that
the reasonableness of his \"explanation or excuse\" should be determined
solely with reference to his own subjective viewpoint. Such reliance is
misplaced.

In Patterson, this court was concerned with the question of whether the
defendant **\[ ... \]**could properly be charged with the burden of
proving the affirmative defense of \"extreme emotional disturbance\". In
deciding that the defendant could constitutionally be required to carry
such a burden, we noted that \"(t) he purpose of the extreme emotional
disturbance defense is to permit the defendant to show that his actions
were caused by a mental infirmity not arising to the level of insanity,
and that he is less culpable for having committed them.\" (39 N.Y.2d, at
p. 302, 383 N.Y.S.2d, at p. 582, 347 N.E.2d, at p. 907.) We also noted
that \"(t)he differences between the present New York statute and its
predecessor \* \* \* can be explained by the tremendous advances made in
psychology since 1881 and a willingness on the part of the courts,
legislators, and the public to reduce the level of responsibility
imposed on those whose capacity has been diminished by mental trauma.\"
(Id., at p. 303, 383 N.Y.S.2d, at p. 908, 347 N.E.2d, at p. 582.) These
comments, however, were relevant to our decision only insofar as they
demonstrated that the affirmative defense of \"extreme emotional
disturbance\" is a mitigating factor which the defendant must prove as
opposed to a substantive element of the crime of murder which the People
must prove.

Defendant, however, would read Patterson as holding that all mental
infirmity, short of insanity, must constitute \"extreme emotional
disturbance\" if such infirmity causes the defendant to become
emotionally disturbed and the defendant subjectively believed his
disturbance had a reasonable explanation or excuse. While it is true
that the court in Patterson recognized that \"extreme emotional
disturbance\" as contemplated by the statute is a lesser form of mental
infirmity than insanity,
[^\[1\]^](#Xc2c1131a4d8cbedf6897ad487b986bec4349192) the court did not
hold that all mental infirmities not arising to the level of insanity
constitute \"extreme emotional disturbance\" within the meaning of the
statute. This question was not presented to us in Patterson and we did
not decide it. Defendant\'s attempt to further extend our holding in
Patterson to support the proposition that the reasonableness of the
explanation or excuse for defendant\'s emotional disturbance must be
tested from the subjective viewpoint of defendant is completely
unavailing, for that case had nothing whatever to do with this issue.

Having determined that our decision in Patterson does not require that
reasonableness be tested with a completely subjective standard, we must
now determine whether the language of the statute or the legislative
history of the statute indicates that such a standard is required.

Section 125.25 (subd. 1, par. (a)) of the Penal Law states it is an
affirmative defense to the crime of murder that \"(t)he defendant acted
under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was
a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be
determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\'s situation
under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\" Whether
the language of this statute requires a completely subjective evaluation
of reasonableness is a question that has never been decided by this
court, although it has been raised in our lower courts with diverse
results. (Compare People v. Shelton, 88 Misc.2d 136, 385 N.Y.S.2d 708,
supra, with People v. Lyttle, 95 Misc.2d 879, 884, 408 N.Y.S.2d 578.)
Moreover, although several States have enacted identical or
substantially **\[ ... \]** similar statutes (see Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann., §
53a-54, subd. (a), par. (1); Del.Code Ann., tit. 11, § 641; Hawaii Penal
Code, § 707-702, subd. (2); Ky.Rev.Stat., § 507.020, subd. (1), par.
(a); Rev.Codes of Mont., § 94-5-103; N.D. Century Code, § 12.1-16-02;
Ore.Rev.Stat., § 163.115; Utah Code Ann., § 76-5-205), only one decision
of the highest court of any of our sister States which has addressed
this question has been called to our attention (State v. Elliott, 177
Conn. 1, 411 A.2d 3 (1979)) and that court expressly followed Justice
Bentley Kassal\'s well-reasoned opinion in People v. Shelton, 88 Misc.2d
136, 385 N.Y.S.2d 708, supra.

Consideration of the Comments to the Model Penal Code, from which the
New York statute was drawn, are instructive. (Model Penal Code, § 201.3,
Comment (Tent Draft No. 9 (1959)).) The defense of \"extreme emotional
disturbance\" has two principal components (1) the particular defendant
must have \"acted under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance\", and (2) there must have been \"a reasonable explanation
or excuse\" for such extreme emotional disturbance, \"the reasonableness
of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the
defendant\'s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed
them to be\". The first requirement is wholly subjective i. e., it
involves a determination that the particular defendant did in fact act
under extreme emotional disturbance, that the claimed explanation as to
the cause of his action is not contrived or sham.

The second component is more difficult to describe i. e., whether there
was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance. It
was designed to sweep away \"the rigid rules that have developed with
respect to the sufficiency of particular types of provocation, such as
the rule that words alone can never be enough\" (id., at pp. 46-47), and
\"avoids a merely arbitrary limitation on the nature of the antecedent
circumstances that may justify a mitigation\" (id.). \"The ultimate
test, however, is objective; there must be \'reasonable\' explanation or
excuse for the actor\'s disturbance\" (id., at p. 41). In light of these
comments and the necessity of articulating the defense in terms
comprehensible to jurors, we conclude that the determination whether
there was reasonable explanation or excuse for a particular emotional
disturbance should be made by viewing the subjective, internal situation
in which the defendant found himself and the external circumstances as
he perceived them at the time, however inaccurate that perception may
have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation or
excuse for his emotional disturbance was reasonable, so as to entitle
him to a reduction of the crime charged from murder in the second degree
to manslaughter in the first degree.
[^\[2\]^](#Xfb24e030c2a204b51373a0775f5b6a0914a1ec2) We recognize that
even such a description of the defense provides no precise guidelines
and necessarily leaves room for the exercise of judgmental evaluation by
the jury. This, however, appears to have been the intent of the
draftsmen. \"The purpose was explicitly to give full scope to what
amounts to a plea in mitigation based upon a mental or emotional trauma
of significant dimensions, with the jury asked to show whatever empathy
it can.\" (Wechsler, Codification of Criminal Law in the United States:
The Model Penal Code, 68 Col.L.Rev. 1425, 1446.)

By suggesting a standard of evaluation which contains both subjective
and objective elements, we believe that the drafters of the code
adequately achieved their dual goals of broadening the \"heat of
passion\" doctrine to apply to a wider range of circumstances while
retaining some element of objectivity in the process. The result of
their draftsmanship is a statute which offers the defendant a fair
opportunity to **\[ ... \]**seek mitigation without requiring that the
trier of fact find mitigation in each case where an emotional
disturbance is shown or as the drafters put it, to offer \"room for
argument as to the reasonableness of the explanations or excuses
offered.\"

We note also that this interpretation comports with what has long been
recognized as the underlying purpose of any mitigation statute. In the
words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, referring to an earlier statute: \"What we
have is merely a privilege offered to the jury to find the lesser degree
when the suddenness of the intent, the vehemence of the passion, seems
to call irresistibly for the exercise of mercy. I have no objection to
giving them this dispensing power, but it should be given to them
directly and not in a mystifying cloud of words.\" (Cardozo, Law and
Literature, pp. 100-101.) In the end, we believe that what the
Legislature intended in enacting the statute was to allow the finder of
fact the discretionary power to mitigate the penalty when presented with
a situation which, under the circumstances, appears to them to have
caused an understandable weakness in one of their fellows. Perhaps the
chief virtue of the statute is that it allows such discretion without
engaging in a detailed explanation of individual circumstances in which
the statute would apply, thus avoiding the \"mystifying cloud of words\"
which Mr. Justice Cardozo abhorred.

We conclude that the trial court, in this case, properly applied the
statute. The court apparently accepted, as a factual matter, that
defendant killed Miss Lo Consolo while under the influence of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\", a threshold question which must be answered in
the affirmative before any test of reasonableness is required. The
court, however, also recognized that in exercising its function as trier
of fact, it must make a further inquiry into the reasonableness of that
disturbance. In this regard, the court considered each of the mitigating
factors put forward by defendant, including his claimed mental
disability, but found that the excuse offered by defendant was so
peculiar to him that it was unworthy of mitigation. The court obviously
made a sincere effort to understand defendant\'s \"situation\" and \"the
circumstances as defendant believed them to be\", but concluded that the
murder in this case was the result of defendant\'s malevolence rather
than an understandable human response deserving of mercy. We cannot say,
as a matter of law, that the court erred in so concluding. Indeed, to do
so would subvert the purpose of the statute.

In our opinion, this statute would not require that the jury or the
court as trier of fact find mitigation on any particular set of facts,
but, rather, allows the finder of fact the opportunity to do so, such
opportunity being conditional only upon a finding of extreme emotional
disturbance in the first instance. In essence, the statute requires
mitigation to be afforded an emotionally disturbed defendant only when
the trier of fact, after considering a broad range of mitigating
circumstances, believes that such leniency is justified. Since the trier
of fact found that defendant failed to establish that he was acting
\"under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there
was a reasonable explanation or excuse\", defendant\'s conviction of
murder in the second degree should not be reduced to the crime of
manslaughter in the first degree.

In this prosecution stemming from the brutal stabbing by defendant of
his common-law wife, the Appellate Division reversed defendant\'s
conviction of murder in the second degree based on the trial court\'s
failure to charge the jury concerning the affirmative defense of extreme
emotional disturbance. Because the evidence at trial was insufficient to
support the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, we reverse the
Appellate Division order and reinstate defendant\'s conviction.

Gilberto Franco and Norma Ruiz, tenants in the apartment building who
were acquainted with defendant and the victim, testified at trial that
they had seen the couple arguing in the building lobby earlier that day.
Franco recounted that in a conversation he had with defendant two weeks
before the stabbing, \[73\] defendant confided that his wife was crazy
and hooked on drugs, that he was tired and wanted to leave but that he
couldn\'t live at his sister\'s house. At around 4:00 P.M. on the day of
the crime, while in his bedroom, Franco heard defendant and the victim
engaged in a loud argument inside their apartment, which was connected
to his by an airshaft. When Franco heard the sound of glass breaking, he
stopped listening and turned on some music.

About 40 or 50 minutes later, Franco and Ruiz heard defendant yelling in
the hallway outside their apartment. They opened their door and saw
defendant running down the stairs, exclaiming that his wife had killed
herself and that someone should call the police. Defendant was carrying
a small brown bag under his arm. After Franco contacted the police from
a nearby store, he and a friend went to defendant\'s apartment. Franco
testified that he did not enter the apartment but pushed the door open
wide enough to view the interior from the hallway. The apartment was in
disarray and there was blood smeared on the walls. Franco saw defendant
emerge carrying a duffle bag. When asked where he was going, defendant
replied: \"I have to take everything out of here because the police is
going to check it out.\" Defendant stated that he was taking the bag to
his sister\'s house but would return to talk to the police. He then left
the building with the duffle bag.

According to the testimony of Phillip Bell, defendant soon arrived at an
apartment in the adjacent building. Bell had no prior acquaintance with
defendant but was visiting the tenant. When defendant first arrived, he
removed two sweaters that he was wearing and carefully inspected them.
He then ingested crack and heroin. Defendant told Bell that \"Mama\" was
dead and he had killed her. He explained that she had been \"going
crazy\" and \"tearing up the place\" and that he had been \"going back
and forth upstairs \[and\] checking on her\" all day. After socializing
with Bell in a back room for a while, defendant indicated that he had to
leave but did not want to be seen by another visitor who had since
arrived. Defendant instructed Bell to usher the guest into the bathroom
and, once this was accomplished, he departed.

Defendant went to his sister\'s apartment where he was greeted by Pedro
Malave, her son-in-law. Defendant told Malave that his wife was dead and
that she had tried to kill herself two days before. Defendant changed
his socks after requesting a clean pair and threw the pair he had been
wearing in the garbage. When defendant\'s sister arrived, he had a
private \[74\] conversation with her in which he revealed that, in the
course of an argument, he had hit his wife and believed that she was
dead. She advised him to go to the police.

Thereafter, defendant appeared at the police station and announced: \"My
wife killed herself. I want to find out who did this. That\'s why I\'m
here.\" Defendant was issued *Miranda* warnings and he agreed to make a
written statement, which the People introduced in evidence at trial.
Defendant told the police that his wife had been out the night before
and had not come home until 6:00 A.M. She had slept most of the morning
but then sent him on a series of errands that afternoon, first
requesting that he retrieve some items she had thrown out of the window,
then asking him to purchase pain reliever, and later sending him to buy
cigarettes. Defendant indicated he had complied with these requests.

Defendant further recounted that at around 4:00 P.M. he left the
apartment to buy his wife some soup and talked to a neighbor for a
while. Upon returning home, he alleged the door was open and there was
blood in the living room. He called out to his wife but did not see her
until he found her body in the kitchen. He then stated that he ran
through the apartment building screaming that \"Mama killed herself.\"
He asked a woman to call the police and then ran down the street to his
aunt\'s apartment. When his aunt did not answer the door, he proceeded
to his sister\'s home. He stated that he spoke with Malave and his
sister, but indicated only that he told them \"what had happened\" at
his house. After briefly returning to his aunt\'s residence, he
contended he went to the police. The statement does not contain any
reference to a visit with Bell.

**\[ ... \]**

At a charge conference conducted prior to the summations, defendant
requested that the lesser included offense of extreme \[75\] emotional
disturbance manslaughter be submitted to the jury, but made no reference
to a charge on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.
Defense counsel stated that a manslaughter charge \"may not in fact be
supported by the evidence objectively\" but indicated the request was
based on \"what we anticipate the Prosecution\'s closing argument to
encompass\" given that the People had apparently argued at the first
trial that defendant committed the murder after being provoked into a
fit of rage. The People objected to the manslaughter charge, asserting
there was no evidence of extreme emotional disturbance. Supreme Court
denied the charge-down request. The jury convicted defendant of murder
in the second degree and he was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

The Appellate Division reversed, concluding Supreme Court erred in
failing to charge extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative
defense. One Justice dissented and granted the People leave to appeal to
this Court.

The affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance is addressed in
Penal Law § 125.25 (1) (a) and § 125.20 (2), which define the elements
of murder in the second degree and manslaughter in the first degree.
Read in tandem, these statutes provide that a defendant who proves by a
preponderance of the evidence that he or she committed a homicide while
\"under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there
was a reasonable explanation or excuse\" is guilty of manslaughter and
not murder. The \"defense allows a defendant charged with the commission
of acts which would otherwise constitute murder to demonstrate the
existence of mitigating factors which indicate that, although \[\] not
free from responsibility for \[the\] crime, \[defendant\] ought to be
punished less severely\" (*People v Casassa,* 49 NY2d 668, 675, *cert
denied* 449 US 842 \[1980\]). As we recently observed in *People v
Harris* (95 NY2d 316, 318 \[2000\] \[quoting *Casassa,* 49 NY2d at
680-681\] \[internal quotations omitted\]), the Legislature recognized
when it created the extreme emotional disturbance defense that some
homicides are worthy of mitigation because they \"result from an
understandable human response deserving of mercy.\"

A defendant cannot establish an extreme emotional disturbance defense
without evidence that he or she suffered from a mental infirmity not
rising to the level of insanity at the time of the homicide, typically
manifested by a loss of self-control. And not all mental infirmities
merit a manslaughter charge based on extreme emotional disturbance
(*Casassa,* 49 NY2d at 677). To prove such an affirmative defense, a
defendant must \[76\] demonstrate, first, that he or she acted under the
influence of an extreme emotional disturbance and, second, that there
was a reasonable explanation or excuse for that disturbance. The first,
subjective element is met if there is evidence that defendant\'s conduct
at the time of the incident was actually influenced by an extreme
emotional disturbance. The second is an objective element and requires
proof that defendant\'s emotional disturbance was supported by a
reasonable explanation or excuse. This is \"determined by viewing the
subjective mental condition of the defendant and the external
circumstances as the defendant perceived them to be at the time, however
inaccurate that perception may have been, and assessing from that
standpoint whether the explanation or excuse for \[the\] emotional
disturbance was reasonable\" (*Harris,* 95 NY2d at 319 \[quoting
*Casassa,* 49 NY2d at 679\] \[internal quotations omitted\]).

A defendant who pursues an inconsistent defense at trial, such as
outright denial of involvement in the crime, may nevertheless be
entitled to a manslaughter charge based on extreme emotional disturbance
(*see* *People v White,* 79 NY2d 900, 903 \[1992\]). And it is possible
for a defendant to establish the presence of such a disturbance without
psychiatric testimony (*People v Moye,* 66 NY2d 887, 890 \[1985\]).
These circumstances do, however, impact whether sufficient evidence to
support the defense has been presented at trial (*see* *White,* 79 NY2d
at 903). In the absence of the requisite proof, an extreme emotional
disturbance charge should not be given because it would invite the jury
to engage in impermissible speculation concerning defendant\'s state of
mind at the time of the homicide (*People v Walker,* 64 NY2d 741, 743
\[1984\]).

Applying these principles to this case, we conclude that defendant was
not entitled to a manslaughter charge-down based on extreme emotional
disturbance because the proof was insufficient to support either element
of the defense.^\[\*\]^ Beginning with the subjective element, the
record is devoid of evidence that he actually suffered from a mental
infirmity at the time of \[77\] the stabbing. Defendant cannot rely on
his statements to the police to establish the presence of an extreme
emotional disturbance since he asserted that he had not harmed his wife
in any respect. Evidence of mental infirmity is not discernible from
defendant\'s remarks to Bell and his sister because he neither claimed
that he suffered a loss of self-control nor used any other language
suggesting that he killed the victim while under the influence of a
mental disability. Similarly, defendant\'s behavior prior to and
immediately after the crime was not indicative of extreme emotional
disturbance. Soon after the killing, defendant contrived a false
explanation for the victim\'s wounds, telling his neighbors that she had
committed suicide. Moments later, defendant had the presence of mind to
gather items in a duffle bag and remove them from the apartment so they
would not be discovered by the police---conduct inconsistent with the
loss of self-control associated with the defense. Bell\'s testimony
regarding defendant\'s conversations and drug consumption, particularly
his attempt to evade detection by another guest at the apartment, also
do not indicate a disturbed state of mind.

This case is similar to *People v White* (79 NY2d 900) which also
involved a defendant who killed his wife in the apartment they shared.
Like this defendant, White claimed that he had no involvement in the
incident but had discovered his wife dead in their apartment. As in this
case, no psychiatric evidence was proffered to support an extreme
emotional disturbance defense, nor did defendant tell the police or any
other witness that he had experienced a loss of self-control or other
mental disturbance which caused him to stab his wife. There we held that
defendant was not entitled to the charge-down, observing that the record
was barren of any statement of defendant or other evidence offered by
any witness which suggested defendant actually suffered from an extreme
emotional disturbance at the time of the homicide.

Defendant contends that the brutal nature of the stabbing constituted
evidence that he acted under the influence of a mental infirmity. While
proof concerning the nature of the wounds defendant inflicted is
relevant (*see generally,* *People v Wood,* 79 NY2d 958 \[1992\]), we
have never held that a jury may infer the presence of an extreme
emotional disturbance based solely on proof that the crime was
especially violent or brutal. This is so because violence and brutality
are not necessarily indicative of a loss of self-control or similar
mental infirmity, nor is brutality generally more deserving of mercy.
Where \[78\] we have referenced the nature or severity of the wounds,
the probative value of such evidence has been linked to other compelling
evidence of extreme emotional disturbance. For example, we observed in
*People v Moye* (66 NY2d at 890) that \"\[d\]efendant\'s savage acts of
mutilating and decapitating his victim, coupled with his statements to
the police and District Attorney that \`something snapped\' inside him
when \[the victim\] mocked and taunted him, that he went \`bananas\' and
he needed help, were evidence of a loss of self-control.\" The approach
defendant suggests would subvert the purpose of the affirmative defense
by automatically providing the benefit of a manslaughter charge-down to
every defendant who commits a particularly brutal or violent
homicide---a result the Legislature certainly did not intend.

Even if sufficient evidence of the subjective element of extreme
emotional disturbance were present in this case, proof of the objective
element is lacking. Defendant points to the fact that he and the victim
had been seen arguing and that the victim apparently sent him on a
number of errands on the afternoon of the murder, causing him to climb
the stairs to the fifth-floor apartment numerous times. This falls far
short of the type of tumultuous relationship that might meet the
objective component when coupled with other provocation (*see* *White,*
79 NY2d at 903). In the absence of proof that defendant\'s history or
mental status rendered him unusually sensitive to these verbal exchanges
and demands, no reasonable jury could have concluded that a resulting
loss of self-control or similar disability constituted \"an
understandable human response deserving of mercy\" under these
circumstances (*see* *Casassa,* 49 NY2d at 680-681).

## \[462\] GIBBONS, J.

Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of attempted murder in
the first degree, robbery in the first degree and criminal possession of
a weapon in the third degree. On this appeal, the principal issue is
whether the County Court erred in refusing his request to instruct the
jury on the affirmative defense of \"extreme emotional disturbance\" set
forth in Penal Law § 125.27 (2) (a), which would have had the effect of
permitting the jury to find him guilty of attempted manslaughter in the
first degree (Penal Law §§ 110.00, 125.20 \[2\]) rather than attempted
murder in the first degree in connection with a shooting incident in the
City of New Rochelle on the evening of February 18, 1981. In our view,
this question must be answered in the affirmative. Here, the
\"threshold\" requirement entitling defendant to the charge was met,
i.e., there was \"sufficient credible evidence for the jury to determine
that, by a preponderance of the evidence, the elements of the defense
\[were\] established\" (*see*, *People v Moye*, 66 N.Y.2d 887, 890,
\[463\] n). Accordingly, the ensuing conviction of attempted murder in
the first degree should be reversed and the case remitted for a new
trial on that count of the indictment. As so modified, the judgment
should be affirmed.

Penal Law § 125.27 (2) (a) pertinently provides as follows:

> \"In any prosecution \[for murder in the first degree\], it is an
> affirmative defense that:
>
> \"(a) The defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional
> disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse,
> the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of
> a person in the defendant\'s situation under the circumstances as the
> defendant believed them to be. Nothing contained in this paragraph
> shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a
> conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime
> except murder in the second degree\" (*cf.* Penal Law § 125.25 \[1\]
> \[a**\[ ... \]**

42).

Turning to the evidence, and viewing it most favorably to the accused
(*see*, *People v Moye*, *supra*; *People v Watts*, 57 N.Y.2d 299, 301;
\[464\] *People v Vera*, 94 AD2d 728, 729), it appears that defendant
left his home on February 18, 1981 with no intention of committing a
crime, boarded a train, got off at an unknown location (apparently in
New Rochelle), and just started walking about aimlessly. Upon coming to
a liquor store, the defendant entered and pulled out a gun and demanded
money. The owner offered no resistance. After taking the money, the
defendant \"just stayed there\" in the liquor store for a few more
minutes, and then exited, turned to the left and walked (not ran) down
Main Street toward Beachwood Avenue. A couple of minutes later, the
defendant walked back past the liquor store, this time in the direction
of the New England Thruway.

Shortly after the incident was reported to the police, the defendant,
walking west on Main Street, was observed by New Rochelle Police Officer
Douglas Burrell. The latter exited his vehicle, carrying a shotgun, and
shouted to defendant to stop. Defendant continued walking and \"sort of
looked around\". Officer Burrell then shouted, \"Yeah, you, come here,
police.\" As defendant turned, he fired in Officer Burrell\'s direction.
Officer Burrell returned fire with the shotgun. At this point, and
notwithstanding the fact that his bullets had injured no one, the
defendant simply turned again and resumed walking (albeit, at a
quickened pace), seemingly oblivious to whatever additional action the
officer might have deemed it advisable to take. Other officers soon
arrived, but even when confronted with several armed police officers and
told to halt, the defendant initially failed to respond, and only later
threw down his weapon. In his statement to the police, the defendant
indicated that he had been out of work for approximately nine months. He
had fired upon the police officer because \"he was scared \* \* \* just
scared\", and added that \"a long time ago\" in Santo Domingo, he had
eaten a local fruit which not only made him extremely ill, but left
residual effects, causing him on occasion to \"act irrational\[ly\] or
do things that he does not quite control\".

In addition, the defendant was able to adduce expert psychiatric
testimony to the effect that he had an IQ of 66, in the borderline
retarded category; has several pronounced personality disorders,
including schizophrenia; had become \"increasingly depressed \[and\] \*
\* \* immobilized\" during the period immediately preceding the
shooting; and had fired upon the officer in an \"isolated explosive
episode\", \"spontaneously\" and \"automatically\", i.e.,
\"emotionally\" and \"without thinking\", \[465\] which \"invariably
occurs\" when a person is under \"great emotional stress\". In fact, on
re-cross-examination, one of the defendant\'s experts (Dr. Tuckman)
effectively indicated that, in his opinion, the defendant was acting
under \"extreme emotional disturbance\" at the time of the instant
shooting. This opinion, elicited by the prosecutor, bore directly on the
nature and extent of defendant\'s emotional strain.

Taking the foregoing view of the evidence, it is clear that there exists
on the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case sufficient evidence
which could support a defendant\'s verdict on at least the first
requirement of the statutory affirmative defense, to wit, that at the
time of the instant shooting the defendant was acting under the
influence of \"extreme emotional disturbance\" (Penal Law § 125.27 \[2\]
\[a\]; *People v Casassa*, 49 N.Y.2d 668, *cert denied* 449 US 842,
*supra*). As the Court of Appeals noted in *People v Casassa* (*supra*,
at pp 678, 679), the test to be applied to this element of the statutory
defense is \"wholly subjective\" in nature, and requires a factual
determination that, at the operative moment, \"the particular defendant
did in fact act under extreme emotional disturbance\". Accordingly, no
question as to the \"reasonableness\" of that disturbance is presented
at this juncture, and, thus viewed, there was ample objective and
opinion evidence from which a jury might have concluded that at the time
that he turned and fired, this defendant, for whatever reason or
combination of reasons, was suffering from extreme emotional
disturbance.

A closer question is presented with regard to the second element of the
statutory defense, for here the Court of Appeals has decreed an
\"objective\" standard, pursuant to which the determination as to
whether or not there exists a \"reasonable explanation or excuse\" for
the proffered emotional disturbance (Penal Law § 125.27 \[2\] \[a\]) is
to be made \"by viewing the subjective, internal situation in which the
defendant found himself and the external circumstances as he perceived
them at the time, however inaccurate that perception may have been, and
assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation or excuse for his
emotional disturbance was reasonable\" (*People v Casassa*, 49 N.Y.2d
668, 679, *supra;* *People v Moye*, 66 N.Y.2d 887, *supra; see also*,
ALI Model Penal Code § 210.3). When making a determination of
reasonableness, the critical element in the Model Penal Code formulation
is the clause requiring that reasonableness be assessed \"from the
viewpoint of a person in the actor\'s situation\" (ALI Model Penal Code
§ 210.3 \[1\] \[b\]; \[466\] *cf.* Penal Law § 125.27 \[2\] \[a\]). As
noted in the Model Penal Code Commentaries, \"\[t\]he word \`situation\'
is designedly ambiguous \* \* \* it is clear that personal handicaps and
some external circumstances must be taken into account \* \* \* for it
would be morally obtuse to appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment
without reference to these factors\" (ALI Model Penal Code and
Commentaries § 210.3, at 62 \[Official Draft and Revised Comments,
1980\]).

Since the ultimate question of whether the affirmative defense has been
established rests largely within the discretionary power of the jury
(*see*, *People v Morrison*, 95 AD2d 868, 869), it is our belief that
the delivery of the charge in this case was required in order to give
effect to the salutary purpose underlying enactment of the statutory
defense in the form suggested in the Model Penal Code (*see*, § 210.3
\[1\] \[b\]). As the Court of Appeals stated in *People v Casassa* (49
N.Y.2d 668, 681, *supra*): \"In our opinion, this statute would not
require that the jury or the court as trier of fact find mitigation on
any particular set of facts, but, rather, allows the finder of fact the
opportunity to do so, such opportunity being conditional *only* upon a
finding of extreme emotional disturbance in the first instance. In
essence, the statute requires mitigation to be afforded an emotionally
disturbed defendant only when the trier of fact, after considering a
broad range of mitigating circumstances, believes that such leniency is
justified.\"

And, as noted in the Commentaries to the Model Penal Code: \"In the end,
the question is whether the actor\'s loss of self-control can be
understood in terms that arouse sympathy in the ordinary citizen.
Section 210.3 \[of the Model Penal Code\] faces this issue squarely and
leaves the ultimate judgment to the ordinary citizen in the function of
a juror assigned to resolve the specific case\" (ALI Model Penal Code
and Commentaries § 210.3, at 63 \[Official Draft and Revised Comments,
1980\]).

In this regard we consider most significant an inquiry by the jurors in
the case at bar whether they could recommend leniency to the court.

We agree with our dissenting colleagues that the robbery itself could
not, as a matter of law, constitute a reasonable explanation or excuse
for defendant\'s extreme emotional disturbance (*see*, ALI Model Penal
Code and Commentaries § 210.3, at 64-65 \[Official Draft and Revised
Comments, 1980\]), for an emotional disturbance is excusable only \"\`if
it is \[467\] occasioned by \[a\] provocation, event or situation *for
which the offender was not culpably responsible\'\"* (ALI Model Penal
Code and Commentaries § 210.3, at 64 \[Official Draft and Revised
Comments, 1980\], quoting from the Final Report of the National
Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws --- Proposed New Federal
Criminal Code \[18 USC\] \[Jan. 7, 1971\]).

In our view, the evidence supports a conclusion that the explanation or
excuse offered by this defendant was \"objectively\" reasonable, and not
attributable to the robbery. Dr. Tuckman, a psychiatrist, diagnosed
defendant\'s reaction as an \"isolated explosive episode\" triggered by
increasing depression and immobilization. In his opinion, the tremendous
strain affecting defendant flowed from \"more than\" the robbery. It was
also caused by his prolonged unemployment and his inadequate fragile
personality. Dr. Goldstein, a certified clinical psychologist, agreed
that defendant\'s adjustment and explosive disorder predated the robbery
by six months. Furthermore, in his opinion, defendant\'s residual type
schizophrenia probably dated back to his childhood and first
hospitalization at age 14 (from the toxic fruit).

In sum, the evidence on this record indicates that defendant\'s
disturbance could have predated the robbery, and, taking into account
his inadequate personality and borderline retardation, could have been
triggered by the stress of his prolonged unemployment, as well as the
residual effects of his ingestion of toxic fruit as a youngster in Santo
Domingo. Whether the culpable or nonculpable situations and events were
responsible for defendant\'s disturbance was a factual question to be
resolved by the jury, upon proper instructions.

To reach its conclusion that there is insufficient credible evidence to
support the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, the dissent
emphasizes unfavorable portions of the testimony, in abrogation of the
rule that the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to
defendant (*see*, *People v Moye*, 66 N.Y.2d 887, *supra;* *People v
Watts*, *supra*, at p 301; *People v Vera*, 94 AD2d 728, 729, *supra*).
That defendant was not psychotic or insane is irrelevant. The issue is
whether there was sufficient evidence to create a question for the trier
of fact that defendant was acting under the influence of extreme
emotional disturbance, for which there was a reasonable explanation or
excuse. Contrary to the position adopted by the dissent, the evidence
permits a conclusion that defendant\'s overwhelming emotional stress
arose prior to and was \[468\] triggered by factors other than his
commission of the robbery. The dissent, rather than acknowledging the
factual issue raised, resolves it, concluding that defendant brought
about his own mental disturbance by involving himself in a crime. The
cause and reasonableness of defendant\'s extreme emotional disturbance
was properly a factual question to be resolved by the jury, for once the
threshold requirement is met, i.e., once \"there is sufficient credible
evidence for the jury to determine that, by a preponderance of the
evidence, the elements of the defense are established\", it is \"then
for the jury to resolve inconsistencies in testimony and reach
conclusions as to the \`volitional, deliberate and calculated\' nature
of defendant\'s acts\" (*People v Moye*, 66 N.Y.2d 887, 890, n,
*supra*).

We are persuaded in reaching this conclusion by the peculiar facts and
circumstances of this case, particularly the uncontroverted testimony of
prosecution witnesses concerning defendant\'s strange behavior on the
date of the robbery, his hesitation, aimless wandering and seeming
incomprehension of his situation. We acknowledge that it will be a rare
case where the defense of extreme emotional disturbance will be
applicable when a homicide or attempted homicide follows commission of
another crime.

Accordingly, since, under the facts and circumstances of this case,
there was sufficient credible evidence which would support a finding of
extreme emotional disturbance, and inasmuch as an explanation had been
offered by the defendant and his psychiatric experts, \"which a rational
jury might have accepted or rejected\" (*see*, *People v Moye*, 66
N.Y.2d 887, 890, *supra*), the County Court erred in refusing to honor
the defendant\'s request to charge on the affirmative defense of
\"extreme emotional disturbance\" (Penal Law § 125.27 \[2\] \[a\];
*see*, *People v Lanzot*, 67 AD2d 864, *appeal dismissed* 49 N.Y.2d 796,
*supra*). Under such circumstances, the failure of the trial court to
deliver the requested charge constituted reversible error (*see*,
*People v Moye*, *supra*; *People v Watts*, 57 N.Y.2d 299, 301, *supra;*
*People v Vera*, 94 AD2d 728, 729, *supra*).

**\[ ... \]**

LAWRENCE, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

We are unanimous in affirming the convictions for robbery in the first
degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and the
sentences imposed thereon. We also agree that the affirmative defense of
extreme emotional disturbance is available, in a proper case, where the
charge is attempted murder of a police officer (Penal Law §§ 110.00,
125.27 \[2\] \[a\]; *People v Lanzot*, 67 AD2d 864, 866, *appeal
dismissed* 49 N.Y.2d 796). The issue which divides us is simply whether
in this case the evidence presented was such as to warrant submitting
the affirmative defense to the jury. In my view, based on the law and
the facts, the trial court properly declined defendant\'s request to so
charge the jury.

As noted by the Court of Appeals in *People v Moye* (66 N.Y.2d 887, 890,
n), \"\[i\]n determining whether to submit the affirmative defense of
extreme emotional disturbance to the jury, it is for the court initially
to decide if there is sufficient credible evidence for the jury to
determine that, by a preponderance of the evidence, the elements of the
defense are established\".

It is clear that the affirmative defense of extreme emotional
disturbance was intended to replace \"the traditional language of \`heat
of passion\', with a new formulation\", and thus avoid \"so arbitrary a
limit on the nature of circumstances that might justify a mitigation\"
(*People v Patterson*, *supra*, at pp 300-301). Nevertheless, implicit
in the Model Penal Code formulation of the defense, from which our
statute is derived, \[472\] is the concept that an extreme emotional
disturbance is excusable only \"\`if it is occasioned by any provocation
\* \* \* *for which the offender was not culpably responsible*\'\" (ALI
Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 210.3, at 64 \[Official Draft and
Revised Comments, 1980\], quoting from the Final Report of the National
Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws --- Proposed New Federal
Criminal Code \[18 USC\] \[Jan. 7, 1971\]). \"Under this formulation,
extreme emotional disturbance will not reduce murder to manslaughter if
the actor has intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently
brought about his own mental disturbance, *such as by involving himself
in a crime*\" (ALI Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 210.3, at 64
\[Official Draft and Revised Comments, 1980\]; emphasis added).

Thus, it must be concluded that in enacting the affirmative defense, the
Legislature did not intend it to apply where the emotional stress arises
out of and is directly related to the commission of an armed violent
felony, such as robbery in the first degree. Obviously, a person
committing an armed robbery may be acting under extreme emotional stress
which might overwhelm him and cause him to lose self-control. According
to the psychiatric testimony, that is precisely what happened in this
case.

The defense psychiatrist described defendant as mildly retarded with
several pronounced personality disorders, including schizophrenia.
However, the defense psychiatrist testified that defendant was *not
psychotic* on the day of the robbery and shooting. He further testified
that defendant was not \"legally insane\", \"\[b\]ecause \* \* \* up
until the firing of the gun, he knew what he was doing\". The defense
psychiatrist opined: \"\[W\]hat I saw, was a man who knew what he was
doing, but was overwhelmed by tremendous strain, and the reaction was
automatic, *but he knew what he was doing up until the time he started
firing the weapon*\" (emphasis added).

The psychiatrist gave the following further responses on redirect
examination:

> \"Q. You have referred to emotional strain and stress and pressure.
> Can you be specific as to your opinion of what those pressures were at
> the moment that \[defendant\] shot the gun? What were the pressures
> confronting him?
>
> \"A. The pressures of being out of work, of knowing that he had done
> something bad, something wrong.
>
> \"Q. When you say, \`done something wrong\' ---
>
> \[473\] \"A. The robbery, not knowing what to do about it, and being
> confronted with a police officer, I believe it was overwhelming to
> him.\"

The testimony does not describe a significant mental trauma that has
affected the defendant\'s mind for a substantial period of time,
simmering in the unknown subconscious and then coming to the fore
(*see*, *People v Patterson*, 39 N.Y.2d 288, 303, *supra*). Nor can such
a result properly be achieved, in my view, by linking the situation
which led to the commission of the armed robbery with the alleged
\"detached, isolated explosive episode\" which according to the defense
psychiatrist prevented defendant from reflecting upon his actions *at
the time of the shooting.*

Defendant\'s actions at the time of the robbery and his subsequent
shooting at the police officer were not bizarre so as to add credible
support to the claim of extreme emotional disturbance, unrelated to
defendant\'s own culpable conduct (*cf.* *People v Moye*, *supra*). Once
defendant had decided to rob the liquor store (assuming it was a spur of
the moment decision), it is not disputed that he calmly committed the
crime. Afterwards, he walked from the store, turned left, but upon
changing his mind, he turned around and walked back past the store,
motioning to the store owner, apparently to stay inside the store.
Defendant then proceeded for a distance of about one-quarter mile before
he was stopped by the police. Any hesitation by the defendant during his
shooting encounter with the police was clearly associated by the defense
psychiatrist with the situation in which defendant found himself,
knowing he had \"done something bad, something wrong\". Moreover, I
cannot see any significance in defendant\'s statement, made to the
Spanish-speaking police officer the day after the shooting, in
substance, that he still suffered some residual effects from eating some
toxic fruit as a youngster in Santo Domingo. The defense psychologist
testified concerning this long past incident, allegedly involving some
unknown fruit with hallucinogenic properties, as related to him, not by
the defendant, but by defendant\'s brother; but there was no
documentation of such an alleged event. Nor did the experts proffered by
defendant link the alleged incident with the robbery or the shooting.
The defense psychiatrist *never attempted to relate* this \"fruit of a
poisoned tree\" to defendant\'s mental state at the time of the
shooting. In fact, the psychiatrist never mentioned the toxic fruit
incident at all in his testimony. Further, I simply cannot agree with my
colleagues \[474\] in the majority that defendant, who engaged in a
shoot-out with the police officer after he had committed an armed
robbery, was entitled to a charge as to extreme emotional disturbance
because he had been unemployed for a period of nine months prior to the
crime and allegedly suffered from an \"inadequate fragile personality\".

Accordingly, it cannot be said that there was sufficient credible
evidence which would warrant a charge to the jury on the affirmative
defense of extreme emotional disturbance (*compare*, *People v Walker*,
64 N.Y.2d 741, *with* *People v Moye*, 66 N.Y.2d 887, *supra*).

State v. Williams

 

**\[ ... \]**

**484 P.2d 1167**

**STATE of Washington, Respondent,**\
**v.**\
**Walter L. WILLIAMS \[ ... \]**

**Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 1, Panel One.**

**May 3, 1971.**

 

**\[ ... \]**

HOROWITZ, Chief Judge.

Defendants, husband and wife, were charged by information filed October
3, 1968, with the crime of manslaughter for negligently failing to
supply their 17-month child with necessary medical attention, as a
result of which he died on September 12, 1968. Upon entry of findings,
conclusions and judgment of guilty, sentences were imposed on April 22,
1969. Defendants appeal.

The defendant husband, Walter Williams, is a 24-year old full-blooded
Sheshont Indian with a sixth-grade education. His sole occupation is
that of laborer. The defendant wife, Bernice Williams, is a **\[ ...
\]** 20-year-old part Indian with an 11th grade education. At the time
of the marriage, the wife had two children, the younger of whom was a
14-month son. Both parents worked and the children were cared for by the
85-year-old mother of the defendant husband. The defendant husband
assumed parental responsibility with the defendant wife to provide
clothing, care and medical attention for the child. Both defendants
possessed a great deal of love and affection for the defendant wife\'s
young son.

The court expressly found:

That both defendants were aware that William Joseph **\[ ... \]**
Tabafunda was ill during the period September 1, 1968 to September 12,
1968. The defendants were ignorant. They did not realize how sick the
baby was. They thought that the baby had a toothache and no layman
regards a toothache as dangerous to life. They loved the baby and gave
it aspirin in hopes of improving its condition. They did not take the
baby to a doctor because of fear that the Welfare Department would take
the baby away from them. They knew that medical help was available
because of previous experience. They had no excuse that the law will
recognize for not taking the baby to a doctor.

The defendants Walter L. Williams and Bernice J. Williams were negligent
in not seeking medical attention for William Joseph Tabafunda.

That as a proximate result of this negligence, William Joseph Tabafunda
died.

**\[ ... \]**From these and other findings, the court concluded that the
defendants were each guilty of the crime of manslaughter as charged.

Defendants take no exception to findings but contend that the findings
do not support the conclusions that the defendants are guilty of
manslaughter as charged. **\[ ... \]**

Parental duty to provide medical care for a dependent minor child was
recognized at common law and characterized as a natural duty. **\[ ...
\]** On the question of the quality or seriousness of breach of the
duty, at common law, in the case of involuntary manslaughter, the breach
had to amount to more than mere ordinary or simple negligence\--gross
negligence was essential. **\[ ... \]** In Washington, however, RCW
9.48.060 [^\[2\]^](#X5d31174b1e4543a7e18f8327b7f3b993b6ec247) (since
amended by Laws of 1970, ch. 49, § 2) and RCW 9.48.150
[^\[3\]^](#X75072abfbca23f4fb6b6e8eddf23e991ccde332) supersede both
voluntary and **\[ ... \]** involuntary manslaughter as those crimes
were defined at common law. Under these statutes the crime is deemed
committed even though the death of the victim is the proximate result of
only simple or ordinary negligence. **\[ ... \]**

The information charging statutory manslaughter made no mention of and
did not purport to restrict itself to the violation of the duty set
forth in RCW 26.20.030(1)(b). The information charged the violation of
\'the legal duty of providing necessary \* \* \* medical attention to
said \* \* \* minor child \* \* \*\' This general language permits
reliance upon the existence of the legal duty no matter from what source
derived. We have already pointed out that such a parental duty is
recognized in the decisions of this state and has been characterized as
a natural duty existing independently of statutes. **\[ ... \]**We
therefore hold that the violation of the parental duty to furnish
medical care to a minor dependent child, the other elements of
manslaughter being present, is a sufficient basis on which to rest a
conviction of the crime of manslaughter **\[ ... \]**

In the instant case, however, the defendant husband is not the father of
the minor child, nor has he adopted that child. Nevertheless, the
evidence shows that he had assumed responsibility with his wife for the
care and maintenance of the child, whom he greatly loved. Such
assumption of responsibility, characterized in the information as that
required of a \'guardian and custodian,\' is sufficient to impose upon
him the duty to furnish necessary medical care. **\[ ... \]**

The remaining issue of proximate cause requires consideration of the
question of when the duty to furnish medical care became activated. If
the duty to furnish such care was not activated until after it was too
late to save the life of the child, failure to furnish medical care
could not be said to have proximately caused the child\'s death.
Timeliness in the furnishing of medical care also must be considered in
terms of \'ordinary caution.\' The law does not mandatorily require that
a doctor be called for a child at the first sign of any indisposition or
illness. The indisposition or illness may appear to be of a minor or
very temporary kind, such as a toothache or cold. If one in the exercise
of ordinary caution fails to recognize that his child\'s symptoms
require medical attention, it cannot be said that the failure to obtain
such medical attention is a breach of the duty owed. **\[ ... \]**

Because of the serious nature of the charge against the parent and
step-parent of a well-loved child, and out of our concern for the
protection of the constitutional rights of the defendants, we have made
an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether it
substantially supports the court\'s express finding on proximate cause
and its implied finding that the duty to furnish medical care became
activated in time to prevent death of the child. **\[ ... \]**

Dr. Gale Wilson, the autopsy surgeon and chief pathologist for the King
County Coroner, testified that the child died because an abscessed tooth
had been allowed to develop into an infection of the mouth and cheeks,
eventually becoming gangrenous. This condition, accompanied by the
child\'s inability to eat, brought about malnutrition, lowering the
child\'s resistance and eventually producing pneumonia, causing the
death. Dr. Wilson testified that in his opinion **\[ ... \]** the
infection had lasted for approximately 2 weeks, and that the odor
generally associated with gangrene would have been present for
approximately 10 days before death. He also expressed the opinion that
had medical care been first obtained in the last week before the baby\'s
**\[ ... \]** death, such care would have been obtained too late to have
saved the baby\'s life. Accordingly, the baby\'s apparent condition
between September 1 and September 5, 1968 became the critical period for
the purpose of determining whether in the exercise of ordinary caution
defendants should have provided medical care for the minor child.

The testimony concerning the child\'s apparent condition during the
critical period is not crystal clear, but is sufficient to warrant the
following statement of the matter. The defendant husband testified that
he noticed the baby was sick about 2 weeks before the baby died. The
defendant wife testified that she noticed the baby was ill about a week
and a half or 2 weeks before the baby died. The evidence showed that in
the critical period the baby was fussy; that he could not keep his food
down; and that a cheek started swelling up. The swelling went up and
down, but did not disappear. In that same period, the cheek turned \'a
bluish color like.\' The defendants, not realizing that the baby was as
ill as it was or that the baby was in danger of dying, attempted to
provide some relief to the baby by giving the baby aspirin during the
critical period and continued to do so until the night before the baby
died. The defendants thought the swelling would go down and were waiting
for it to do so; and defendant husband testified, that from what he had
heard, neither doctors nor dentists pull out a tooth \'when it\'s all
swollen up like that.\' There was an additional explanation for not
calling a doctor given by each defendant. Defendant husband testified
that \'the way the cheek looked, \* \* \* and that stuff on his hair,
they would think we were neglecting him and take him away from us and
not give him back.\' Defendant wife testified that the defendants were
\'waiting for the swelling to go down,\' and also that they were afraid
to **\[ ... \]** take the child to a doctor for fear that the doctor
would report them to the welfare department, who, in turn, would take
the child away. \'It\'s just that I was so scared of losing him.\' They
testified that they had heard that the defendant husband\'s cousin lost
a child that way. The evidence showed that the defendants did not
understand the significance or seriousness of the baby\'s symptoms.
However, there is no evidence that the defendants were physically or
financially unable to obtain a doctor, or that they did not know an
available doctor, or that the symptoms did not continue to be a matter
of concern during the critical period. Indeed, the evidence shows that
in April 1968 defendant husband had taken the child to a doctor for
medical attention.

In our opinion, there is sufficient evidence from which the court could
find, as it necessarily did, that applying the standard of ordinary
caution, I.e., the caution exercisable by a man of reasonable prudence
under the same or similar conditions, defendants were sufficiently put
on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby\'s illness and lack of
improvement in the baby\'s apparent condition in the period from
September 1 to September 5, 1968 to have required them to have obtained
medical care for the child. The failure so to do in this case is
ordinary or simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to
support a conviction of statutory manslaughter.

The judgment is affirmed.

## \[205\] OPINION OF THE COURT

Per Curiam.

These two appeals call upon the Court, once again, to differentiate
depraved indifference murder from other categories of homicide. We begin
with the facts.

*People v Suarez.* On February 22, 2000, in their Bronx apartment,
defendant Santos Suarez stabbed his girlfriend, Jovanna Gonzalez, three
times --- once in the throat, once in the chest and once in the abdomen.
Suarez fled without summoning assistance, and Gonzalez eventually bled
to death.

When Suarez was arrested six days later in Rhode Island, he told police
that he had slapped Gonzalez in the face during an argument, and that
she had then lunged at him with a knife, scratching him in the chest.
Suarez wrested the knife away and, \"outraged\" that Gonzalez had called
for her son, lunged back at her. According to Suarez\'s account, when he
pulled back, he saw that Gonzalez was bleeding from the neck. He
claimed, however, that he could not remember what happened next. Suarez
was indicted for intentional murder, depraved indifference murder,
intentional manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon in the
fourth degree. At his trial, he testified that he never intended to kill
Gonzalez. Charged on the defense of justification and the affirmative
defense of extreme emotional disturbance, the jury acquitted Suarez of
intentional murder but convicted him of depraved indifference murder.
The Appellate Division affirmed defendant\'s conviction, holding that
the evidence was legally sufficient to establish guilt of depraved
indifference murder.

*People v McPherson.* On February 12, 2000, defendant Trisha McPherson
went to the Brooklyn home of Kirk Wright, her former boyfriend and the
father of her child. According to McPherson, **\[ ... \]**after she and
Wright argued over child support, Wright pushed her. When Wright then
raised his hand as if to hit her, McPherson unzipped her purse, pulled
out a knife, opened the knife and swung it at Wright, stabbing him once
in the chest. When she saw that Wright was bleeding, McPherson
immediately called 911 and requested an ambulance. Before the ambulance
arrived, McPherson left the scene. Wright was transported to a hospital,
where he bled to death from the stab wound. At her nonjury trial for
depraved indifference murder, first-degree manslaughter and
fourth-degree weapon possession, McPherson testified that she had been a
long-suffering victim of domestic violence at the hands of Wright, and
that she was acting in self-defense when she killed him. The court,
however, rejected her justification defense and found her guilty of
depraved indifference murder. Again the Appellate Division affirmed
defendant\'s conviction, holding that the evidence was legally
sufficient to establish guilt of depraved indifference murder.

In each case --- *McPherson* by a unanimous court, *Suarez* by a
six-Judge majority --- we conclude that there was no depraved
indifference murder, and therefore reverse both convictions.

 

## The Statutory Categories of Homicide

With the adoption of the revised Penal Law in 1965, the Legislature
codified five basic categories of homicide, which have remained
essentially unchanged since that time: intentional murder in the second
degree (Penal Law § 125.25 \[1\]),^\[1\]^ depraved indifference murder
in the second degree (Penal Law § 125.25 \[2\]), intentional
manslaughter in the first degree (Penal Law § 125.20 \[1\]), reckless
manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law § 125.15 \[1\]) and
criminally negligent homicide (Penal Law § 125.10). Although the
culpable acts in each case culminate in the same tragic result --- the
death of another --- these crimes, each necessarily meant to proscribe
different conduct, are distinguished by the level of blameworthiness
attributable to the actor who commits them. Intentional murder and
depraved indifference murder are equivalent in that both are classified
at the highest grade and carry the same penalty; other categories of
homicide, lesser in grade, are punished less severely. In so classifying
the range of unlawful killings **\[ ... \]** condemned by the criminal
law, the Legislature has enacted a statutory system in which each
category of homicide is defined uniquely and distinctly from every
other, thus ensuring that a killer\'s punishment is commensurate with
the degree of criminal culpability established by the Penal Law.

What precisely distinguishes depraved indifference murder from other
homicides has of late generated significant discussion,^\[2\]^ as the
number of indictments for depraved indifference murder --- often charged
in conjunction with intentional murder --- has increased dramatically.
Whether because jurors conclude that anyone who would intentionally take
a life is depraved, or because they mistakenly believe that depraved
indifference murder is a lesser offense than intentional murder and are
reluctant to convict of the \"most serious\" charge, the availability of
a depraved indifference murder count has led juries to convict of that
charge even though the evidence did not support it (*see e.g.* *People v
Hafeez,* 100 NY2d 253 \[2003\]; *People v Gonzalez,* 1 NY3d 464
\[2004\]; *People v Payne,* 3 NY3d 266 \[2004\]; *see also* *Policano v
Herbert,* 430 F3d 82 \[2d Cir 2005\]).

The proliferation of the use of depraved indifference murder as a
fallback theory under which to charge intentional killers reflects a
fundamental misunderstanding of the depraved indifference murder
statute. \"\[D\]epraved indifference murder may not be properly charged
in the overwhelming majority of homicides that are prosecuted in New
York\" (*Payne,* 3 NY3d at 270). Rather, because the statute requires
\"circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life\" (Penal
Law § 125.25 \[2\]), depraved indifference murder properly applies only
to a small, and finite, category of cases where the conduct is at least
as morally reprehensible as intentional murder. The cases now before us,
two additional examples of the misapplication of the depraved
indifference murder statute, compel us --- for now and for the future
--- to revisit what is unique and distinctive about **\[ ... \]**that
crime as defined by the Legislature. The purpose here is not to take
anything away from juries (*see* concurring/dissenting op at 227) --- a
valued and essential element of our justice system --- but rather to
provide the guidance that will enable prosecutors, juries, trial courts
and reviewing courts to function without risk of reversal.

 

## Distinction from Intentional Murder

According to Penal Law § 125.25 (2), a person commits depraved
indifference murder when \"\[u\]nder circumstances evincing a depraved
indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which
creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the
death of another person.\"

That taking the life of another can itself, in a sense, be considered a
\"depraved\" act does not, however, turn every killing into depraved
indifference murder as proscribed by the Penal Law. We thus begin by
once again underscoring that the \"use of a weapon can never result in
depraved indifference murder when . . . there is a manifest intent to
kill\" (*Payne,* 3 NY3d at 271 \[2004\] \[point-blank shooting
insufficient to establish depraved indifference murder\]). That is so
because \"\[i\]ndifference to the victim\'s life . . . contrasts with
the intent to take it\" (*id.* at 270). The People concede this
proposition, but seek to distinguish *Suarez* from *Payne,* and from
*Gonzalez* (1 NY3d 464 \[2004\] \[10 shots fired at close range\]),
because in those cases the defendant used a gun, whereas here he used a
knife. Thus, despite *Payne*\'s plain statement that \"a one-on-one
shooting *or knifing* (or similar killing) can almost never qualify as
depraved indifference murder\" (3 NY3d at 272 \[emphasis added\]), the
People maintain that a jury could reasonably have concluded that
Suarez\'s infliction of stab wounds to the throat, chest and abdomen of
his victim reflected not an intent to kill but merely an intent to
seriously injure her.

If the prosecution meant by this nothing more than that the evidence
would have supported defendant\'s conviction for intentional murder ---
despite the jury\'s acquittal of that charge --- as well as his
conviction for intentional manslaughter in the first degree, we would
agree. However, the People contend further that the evidence here also
established depraved indifference murder, on the theory that Suarez\'s
actions in stabbing the victim created a grave risk of her death --- a
risk that he consciously disregarded when he failed to seek medical
assistance for the injuries he intentionally inflicted and instead left
her there to die.

**\[ ... \]**\"That is not the law. If it were, every homicide,
particularly intentional ones, would be converted into depraved
indifference murder\" (*Payne,* 3 NY3d at 270; *see also* *People v
Hafeez,* 100 NY2d 253, 259 \[2003\] \[where defendant\'s conscious
objective was to \"intentionally injur(e)\" the victim, there was \"no
valid line of reasoning that could support a jury\'s conclusion that
defendant possessed the mental culpability required for depraved
indifference murder\"\]).

Indeed, the flaw in the People\'s argument is perhaps best demonstrated
by comparing *Suarez* with *McPherson.* In *Suarez,* the People maintain
that depraved indifference is established by the defendant\'s
intentional infliction of a mortal wound, followed by his flight from
the scene of the killing. Because the defendant left the bleeding victim
still alive without \"finishing her off,\" we are told, he must not have
intended her death (which in turn exempts the case from the \"manifest
intent to kill\" rule of *Payne*). But since he did nothing to save her,
his actions, we are further told, reflected a depraved indifference to
her life.^\[3\]^ In *McPherson,* by contrast, we are told that the
defendant\'s conduct in calling for an ambulance after discovering that
her victim had been wounded in itself reflected depraved indifference.
For, the argument goes, her very actions in summoning assistance show
that she did *not* intend for the victim to die. That being so, her
crime (the People assert) must have been one of indifference, not of
intentionality; and since the risk of death created by a chest wound is
a grave one, the depraved indifference murder statute is satisfied.

When the People can make, and courts can accept, arguments in which both
the rendering of assistance and the failure to render assistance serve
to establish depraved indifference, there must be a fundamental
misapprehension of the concept of the crime.

\[210\] The People\'s argument is flawed on two grounds. First, a
killing (whether intentional or unintentional) is not transformed into
depraved indifference murder simply because the killer does not summon
aid for the victim. Otherwise, homicides would be routinely and
improperly converted into depraved indifference murders whenever --- as
is often the case --- the killer leaves the scene. Even more obviously,
a killing does not become a depraved indifference murder merely because
the killer summons aid and thus reveals an intent that the victim not
die. Surely, a killer does not commit depraved indifference murder just
because he or she wants the victim to live. Second, and irrespective of
what the actor does or does not do after inflicting the fatal injury,
depraved indifference murder is not made out unless the core statutory
requirement of depraved indifference is established.

into depraved indifference murder (*Gonzalez,* 1 NY3d at 468).

 

## Distinction from Intentional Manslaughter

Historically, depraved indifference murder had no application at all to
one-on-one killings (*see generally* Bernard E. Gegan, *A Case of
Depraved Mind Murder,* 49 St John\'s L Rev 417 \[1974\]). Accordingly,
in *Darry v People* (10 NY 120 \[1854\]), this Court held that a
conviction for \"depraved mind\"^\[4\]^ murder required conduct that
endangered many people indiscriminately, reflecting cases in which the
defendant did not wish to kill or injure any particular individual, but
had no care for whether the life of any particular person was lost or
not.

Since the enactment of the revised Penal Law, however, we have
recognized that in rare circumstances, depraved indifference murder can
also be found in certain *unintentional* killings involving only a
single individual. These limited cases are those \[211\] in which ---
although the intent to kill is absent --- the defendant\'s utter
depravity in causing the victim\'s death warrants punishment in excess
of that available for manslaughter. Such cases will arise only when the
acts of the defendant are \"marked by uncommon brutality --- coupled not
with an intent to kill . . . but with depraved indifference to the
victim\'s plight\" (*Payne,* 3 NY3d at 271). To constitute depraved
indifference, the defendant\'s

> \"conduct must be \`\"so wanton, so deficient in a moral sense of
> concern, so devoid of regard of the life or lives of others, and so
> blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as that which
> the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes the death of
> another\"\'\" (*People v Russell,* 91 NY2d 280, 287-288 \[1998\],
> quoting *People v Fenner,* 61 NY2d 971, 973 \[1984\]).

The vast majority of killings simply do not meet this standard. They are
suitably punished by statutes defining intentional murder or
manslaughter in the first or second degree or criminally negligent
homicide.

Depraved indifference murder is not a lesser degree of intentional
murder.^\[5\]^ Moreover, someone who intends to cause serious physical
injury does not commit depraved indifference murder because the intended
victim dies. By definition, \"\[s\]erious physical injury\" includes
injury \"which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes
death\" (Penal Law § 10.00 \[10\]). Thus, one who acts with the
conscious intent to cause serious injury, and who succeeds in doing so,
is guilty only of manslaughter in the first degree. Otherwise, every
intentional manslaughter would also establish depraved indifference
murder --- a result plainly at odds with the discrete classifications
set forth in the statute. Since a defendant who intends to injure or
kill a particular person cannot generally be said to be \"indifferent\"
--- depravedly or otherwise --- to the fate of that person, we
underscore what we said in *Payne*: \"a one-on-one shooting or \[212\]
knifing (or similar killing) can almost never qualify as depraved
indifference murder\" (3 NY3d at 272).^\[6\]^

A defendant may be convicted of depraved indifference murder when but a
single person is endangered in only a few rare circumstances. Two fact
patterns have recurred over the past four decades of experience under
the revised Penal Law. First, when the defendant intends neither to
seriously injure, nor to kill, but nevertheless abandons a helpless and
vulnerable victim in circumstances where the victim is highly likely to
die, the defendant\'s utter callousness to the victim\'s mortal plight
--- arising from a situation created by the defendant --- properly
establishes depraved indifference murder. Thus, in *People v Kibbe* (35
NY2d 407 \[1974\]), the defendants were properly convicted of depraved
indifference murder after they robbed an intoxicated victim and forced
him out of a car on the side of a dark, remote, snowy road, partially
dressed and without shoes in subfreezing temperatures, where he was
struck by a passing truck and killed. Similarly, in *People v Mills* (1
NY3d 269 \[2003\]), the defendant, without intent to harm or kill his
victim, pushed a young boy into the water, watched him submerge without
resurfacing (either because the boy had accidentally struck his head or
because of an epileptic seizure), falsely informed his friends in
response to their cries to help the victim that he was in fact swimming
away, and abandoned the drowning boy to die.

Second, although we have reversed depraved indifference murder
convictions in most cases involving isolated attacks, we have held that
the crime is nevertheless established when a defendant --- acting with a
conscious objective not to kill but to harm --- engages in torture or a
brutal, prolonged and ultimately fatal course of conduct against a
particularly vulnerable victim. When a defendant\'s actions serve to
intensify or prolong a victim\'s suffering, they bespeak a level of
cruelty that establishes \[213\] the depravity mandated by statute.
Thus, in *People v Poplis* (30 NY2d 85 \[1972\]), the defendant
committed depraved indifference murder when, albeit without any intent
to kill, he caused the death of a 3½-year-old infant as a result of
continually beating the child over a period of five days (*see also*
*People v Best,* 85 NY2d 826 \[1995\], *affg* 202 AD2d 1015 \[4th Dept
1994\] \[defendant\'s repeated severe beatings of her nine-year-old son
caused large open wounds resulting in blood poisoning and ultimately
death by asphyxiation; depraved indifference murder established since
defendant continued beatings though aware of child\'s condition\]).

Both of these categories of cases reflect wanton cruelty, brutality or
callousness directed against a particularly vulnerable victim, combined
with utter indifference to the life or safety of the helpless target of
the perpetrator\'s inexcusable acts. We have also upheld convictions for
depraved indifference murder in a few other extraordinary cases
involving conduct that endangered only one person, where the evidence
showed not just recklessness, but depraved indifference to human life
(*see e.g.* *People v Roe,* 74 NY2d 20 \[1989\] \[defendant fired at
point-blank range without knowing whether the bullet was a \"live\" or
\"dummy\" round\]). Where comparable facts are not shown, however, a
jury is foreclosed, as a matter of law, from considering a depraved
indifference murder charge whenever death is the result of a one-on-one
confrontation.^\[7\]^

 

## Distinction from Reckless Manslaughter

Reckless homicide cannot be elevated into depraved indifference murder
merely because the actions of the defendant created a risk of death,
however grave or substantial that risk may have been. Otherwise,
manslaughter in the second degree would routinely and automatically
become depraved indifference murder inasmuch as the victim (who was,
after all, killed) was necessarily exposed to a grave or substantial
risk of death. The critical \[214\] statutory language that separates
second-degree manslaughter from depraved indifference murder is the
defendant\'s underlying *depraved indifference.* \"\[C\]ircumstances
evincing a depraved indifference to human life\" are not established by
recklessness coupled only with actions that carry even an inevitable
risk of death.

We therefore make clear that depraved indifference is best understood as
an utter disregard for the value of human life --- a willingness to act
not because one intends harm, but because one simply doesn\'t care
whether grievous harm results or not. Reflecting wickedness, evil or
inhumanity, as manifested by brutal, heinous and despicable acts,
depraved indifference is embodied in conduct that is \"so wanton, so
deficient in a moral sense of concern, so devoid of regard of the life
or lives of others, and so blameworthy\" as to render the actor as
culpable as one whose conscious objective is to kill (*Russell,* 91 NY2d
at 287 \[internal quotation marks omitted\]).^\[8\]^ Quintessential
examples are firing into a crowd (*see e.g.* *People v Jernatowski,* 238
NY 188 \[1924\]); driving an automobile along a crowded sidewalk at high
speed (*see* *People v Gomez,* 65 NY2d 9 \[1985\]); opening the lion\'s
cage at the zoo; placing a time bomb in a public place; poisoning a well
from which people are accustomed to draw water; opening a drawbridge as
a train is about to pass over it and dropping stones from an overpass
onto a busy highway.

Oftentimes it will not be easy to determine whether a defendant\'s
conscious objective was to kill or merely to injure a victim. But those
are the hard choices to be weighed by the trier of fact. Depraved
indifference murder was never meant as a fallback crime enabling courts
and juries to avoid making these difficult decisions. We therefore make
clear that the statutory provision that a defendant act \"\[u\]nder
circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life\"
constitutes an additional requirement of the crime --- beyond mere
recklessness and risk --- which in turn comprises both depravity and
indifference, and that a jury considering a charge of depraved
indifference murder should be so instructed (*see* *People v Register,*
60 NY2d 270, 276 \[1983\] \[depraved indifference murder statute
\"requires in **\[ ... \]**addition not only that the conduct which
results in death present a grave risk of death but that it also occur
\`(u)nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human
life\'\"\]).

We depart slightly from the *Register* formulation, however, in that we
make clear that the additional requirement of depraved indifference has
meaning independent of the gravity of the risk. As the present cases
illustrate, to focus, as the dissent does, on only the degree of risk
presented by a defendant\'s reckless actions gives insufficient guidance
to prosecutors, courts and juries struggling to distinguish between
these very different crimes. For with the critical inquiry thus cast, it
becomes difficult for trial and appellate courts to determine as a
matter of law whether given conduct has established a *very* substantial
or merely substantial risk of death, particularly because this
determination must, by definition, always be made with the hindsight
that the endangered victim did in fact die. That being so, it is hard
for a court exercising meaningful review ever to deny that the jury
could reasonably have concluded that the defendant\'s conduct must have
created a very substantial (i.e., grave) risk of death, since it
actually succeeded in causing death.

Although the dissent proclaims its faith in the ability of jurors to
make the fine distinction between \"a grave, transcendent risk of death
justifying a conviction of second-degree murder or a substantial risk of
death warranting a manslaughter conviction\" (dissenting/concurring op
at 227), it also concludes that there was no rational view of the
evidence to support the conclusion that McPherson demonstrated a
depraved indifference to the victim\'s life. But of course, the trial
judge found otherwise, and was affirmed by the Appellate Division.

When depraved indifference murder is properly understood, \"twin-count\"
indictments --- charging both intentional homicide and depraved
indifference murder --- should be rare. Twin-count submissions to a
jury, even rarer. For by the time the proof has been presented, it
should be obvious in most cases whether or not the evidence establishes
\"an intentional \[killing\] or no other\" (*People v Wall,* 29 NY2d
863, 864 \[1971\]). Thus, where twin-count indictments are lodged, trial
courts should presume \"that the defendant\'s conduct falls within only
one category of murder and, unless compelling evidence is presented to
the contrary, dismiss the count that is least appropriate to the facts\"
(Abramovsky and Edelstein, 55 Syracuse L Rev at 491).

In sum, whether a small, finite or rare category, depraved indifference
murder should not be routinely charged to a jury. \[216\] Focus on the
three statutory factors that distinguish depraved indifference murder
--- \"circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,\"
recklessness and \"a grave risk of death to another person\" --- should
again make clear that the statute properly applies only to the unusual
case.

 

## Application of the Law to the Facts

In *Suarez,* defendant\'s acts in stabbing his victim in the throat,
chest and abdomen did not, as a matter of law, constitute depraved
indifference murder. Whether he intended to kill her or merely to cause
her serious injury --- and either of these findings, supported by
sufficient evidence, might have been properly made by the jury ---
defendant\'s actions in no way reflected a depraved indifference to her
fate.^\[9\]^ In *McPherson,* defendant\'s conduct may have reflected
recklessness but did not fall within the small, and finite, category of
cases evidencing utter depravity, uncommon brutality and inhuman cruelty
required for depraved indifference murder. **\[ ... \]**

\[217\] Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division
affirming the judgment of conviction and sentence should be reversed and
the case remitted to that Court for further proceedings in accordance
with this opinion. Additionally, in *McPherson,* the order of the
Appellate Division affirming the denial of defendant\'s CPL 440.10
motion should be affirmed.

Chief Judge LIPPMAN.

Defendants in these three appeals challenge their convictions of
depraved indifference murder. Each defendant drove in an outrageously
reckless manner while intoxicated by alcohol or drugs and caused the
death of at least one other person. Defendants maintain that the
evidence was not legally sufficient to support their
convictions---specifically, that there was insufficient proof that they
had the requisite mental state of depraved indifference. Although
intoxicated driving cases that present circumstances evincing a depraved
indifference to human life are likely to be few and far between, we find
that the evidence in each of these unusually egregious cases was legally
sufficient to support the convictions.

 

## *People v Heidgen*

 

At about 4:30 p.m. on July 1, 2005, defendant Martin Heidgen met a
friend for drinks at a Manhattan bar. When the friend left about three
hours later, defendant, who remained at the bar, had already consumed
six beers. Later that night, between 11:00 p.m. and midnight, defendant
drove to a party at a friend\'s house in Merrick. Defendant proceeded to
consume several additional alcoholic beverages at the party. Although he
appeared to be intoxicated or \"buzzed,\" defendant was not unsteady on
his feet or slurring his words. Defendant left the party after about an
hour and a half, without saying goodbye. It was not only well-known
among their group of friends that there would**\[ ... \]** always be a
place to stay or a designated driver available if necessary, but one
friend testified that she had had a specific conversation with defendant
to that effect about a week prior to the party.

Just before 2:00 a.m., witnesses saw defendant driving north on the
southbound side of the Meadowbrook Parkway. One witness testified that
she pulled over when she saw defendant\'s headlights coming at her and
honked her horn three times, but that defendant did not deviate from the
center lane or reduce his speed, which she estimated at about 70 to 75
miles per hour. A second witness testified that, when he saw
defendant\'s pickup truck approaching, the witness drifted slightly to
the left and that \"it appeared as if \[defendant\'s\] car was drifting
with me.\" After defendant passed him, the witness looked in his
rearview mirror and observed that defendant\'s brake lights were not
illuminated. The witness estimated defendant\'s speed at between 70 and
80 miles per hour.

A third witness testified that he had been driving his motorcycle on the
northbound side of the Meadowbrook Parkway, when he saw defendant\'s
vehicle on the wrong side of the road. He testified that he rode next to
defendant---separated by the guardrail---and that they were traveling at
about 70 miles per hour. Despite the witness\'s \"loud\" motorcycle at
his side, defendant only looked straight ahead and appeared \"very
intent at driving.\" The witness lost sight of defendant\'s car when the
guardrail was replaced by a median of trees and bushes.

After traveling about 2½ miles on the wrong side of the parkway, past
multiple \"wrong way\" signs and the backs of several other road signs,
defendant crashed head-on into a limousine that was bringing several
family members home from a wedding. Both the driver, Stanley Rabinowitz,
and seven-year-old passenger, Katie Flynn, were killed on impact.
Several other family members sustained grievous physical injuries. One
of the passengers in the limousine, Christopher Tangney, a former Nassau
County Police Officer, testified to what he had observed through the
vehicle\'s windshield. Tangney testified that they saw defendant coming
at them, but that Rabinowitz was unable to move out of the left lane
because there was another car next to them. Tangney estimated
defendant\'s speed at about 65 miles per hour and observed that, when
the limousine attempted to move to the right, defendant \"seemed to
follow us, the headlights.\"

Defendant was arrested at the
scene[^\[1\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#%5B1%5D)
and transported to the hospital. He smelled of alcohol and was generally
characterized as either unresponsive or incoherent by police officers
and medical professionals. At the request of the State Police, the
emergency room nurse obtained a blood sample from defendant which
revealed a blood alcohol concentration of
.28%.[^\[2\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#%5B2%5D)

Dr. Closson, a forensic toxicologist, testified for the prosecution that
defendant\'s blood alcohol concentration meant that he would have had
difficulty processing stimuli in the environment, that his cognitive
abilities would have been impeded and that he could have had blurry,
\"tunnel vision,\" which would have reduced his peripheral vision. The
blood alcohol concentration could have contributed to the disregard of
substantial, or even grave, risks. Closson testified that a \"divided
attention activity,\" such as driving, would have presented difficulties
because persons under the influence of alcohol are more likely to focus
on one task than on performing several activities simultaneously. In
addition, defendant\'s reaction time would have been
decreased---although it would have decreased as a matter of seconds,
rather than minutes, and would not have caused him to fail to perceive
or react to his surroundings at all. Dr. Closson testified that the .28%
reading meant that defendant had approximately 14 drinks in his system
at the time of the test, but gave a \"conservative estimate\" that
defendant had consumed at least 20 drinks in all.

[**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p270)

The defense retained an engineer, Steven Schneider, who was qualified as
an accident reconstruction
expert.[^\[3\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#%5B3%5D)
Schneider calculated that the limousine had been traveling at 49 miles
per hour on impact. He further estimated that defendant\'s vehicle had
been traveling somewhere between 27 and 38 miles per hour. The People
did not call an expert and instead relied upon the testimony of lay
eyewitnesses regarding defendant\'s speed.

The jury was instructed that, when determining whether defendant had
acted with depraved indifference to human life, it should consider
whether he was too intoxicated to be able to form the requisite mental
state. Defendant was convicted after trial of two counts of murder in
the second degree, three counts [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p271)of
assault in the first degree and two counts of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol. The court denied defendant\'s posttrial
motion to set aside the verdict, rejecting defendant\'s arguments
asserting juror misconduct and that the People failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he had the state of mind of depraved indifference
to human life.

The Appellate Division affirmed, finding the evidence legally sufficient
to support the conviction (87 AD3d 1016 \[2d Dept 2011\]). **\[ ... \]**

 

## *People v Taylor*

 

On October 18, 2006, defendant Taliyah Taylor spent most of the evening
attempting to record a song she had written in honor of her late father,
who had died when she was a child. Unable to recall the last verse of
the song, she took Ecstasy at about 6:30 p.m. in order to help her focus
and to feel closer to her father. She also drank one beer and smoked
marijuana. A few hours later, defendant left the recording session,
taking her young nephew with her \"to get the evil off of \[him\].\" She
brought him to her mother\'s house, where she removed his clothing.
Taylor also removed her own clothing to show that she had nothing to
hide and should be accepted as she was. Defendant ran outside, still
naked, attempting \"to get away from everything, all the problems, all
the hate, all the greed.\" Over her girlfriend\'s vigorous objections,
Taylor then took the friend\'s car, later explaining that she wanted to
drive \"as fast as the car would take her.\"

At about 10:45 p.m., defendant drove on Forest Avenue in Staten Island
(a local road with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour) at speeds
between 80 and 90 miles per hour, without [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p272)
headlights, on the wrong side of the road, and struck a pedestrian,
Larry Simon, who was crossing the street. Defendant, who was wearing her
seat belt, did not slow down, sound her horn or make any attempt to
swerve. Simon was killed instantly, sustaining injuries that were more
consistent with having been hit by a subway train than by a car. Without
slowing, defendant continued driving in the lane for oncoming traffic,
ran a red light and struck a vehicle that was stopped at that light,
injuring the vehicle\'s occupants. Defendant\'s car then flipped over,
before coming to rest in a parking lot.

Bystanders helped defendant from the vehicle and she began jumping up
and down, chanting \"money, power, respect.\" When the police arrived at
the scene, defendant tried to drive away in an unattended squad car, but
was stopped and arrested. When asked for her pedigree information,
defendant gave her girlfriend\'s name instead of her own on three
separate occasions. The emergency medical personnel generally
characterized defendant as alert and coherent, though under the
influence of drugs or alcohol. A blood test performed after midnight
showed the presence of methylenedioxyamphetamine
(MDA)[^\[4\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#%5B4%5D)
in a concentration that indicated defendant was still actively under the
influence of the drug.

The forensic toxicologist testified that MDA is a central nervous system
stimulant that, at higher dosages, can have hallucinogenic effects. He
observed that individuals under the influence of MDA often exhibit
enhanced risk-taking behavior and that they would have difficulty with a
multi-task activity such as operating a motor vehicle---they might
either switch tasks too quickly or focus on one task to the exclusion of
others. Although cannabinoids were detected in an initial screening
test, their presence was not confirmed by any followup testing. However,
the toxicologist testified that cannabinoids are also hallucinogenic
compounds and could have an additive or synergistic effect if taken with
MDA.

One of the police officers testified that defendant told him that, \"as
she was driving, things were coming at her fast and she made the side to
side motion also like she is avoiding things.\" When asked if she
remembered hitting the pedestrian, she told the officer that \"she saw
him and then he was gone.\"**\[ ... \]** She also related \"that it was
like she was in a movie, but she knew she wasn\'t in a movie.\"

The court denied defense counsel\'s motion to dismiss the depraved
indifference murder charge, rejecting the argument that the People did
not establish the necessary state of mind. The jury was instructed that
it could consider whether defendant was too intoxicated to be capable of
forming the mental state of depraved indifference. Defendant was
convicted of murder in the second degree, reckless endangerment in the
first degree and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence.

The Appellate Division affirmed, finding legally sufficient evidence to
support the conviction (98 AD3d 593 \[2d Dept 2012\]). A Judge of this
Court granted defendant leave to appeal (20 NY3d 1065 \[2013\]) and we
now affirm.

 

## *People v McPherson*

 

At about 3:15 a.m. on October 19, 2007, defendant Franklin McPherson
left a nightclub with his cousin, his girlfriend and one of her friends,
and began arguing with his girlfriend in the parking lot. He was
apparently upset that he had lost something and was seen searching
through the trunk of his car. Witnesses then heard several gunshots and
defendant drove away with his cousin in the car. Police later found five
9 millimeter shell casings in the parking lot.

At 3:30 a.m., defendant\'s car was seen driving west in the eastbound
lanes of the Southern State Parkway at speeds of about 70 to 75 miles
per hour. He traveled about five miles in the wrong direction, passing
eight \"wrong way\" signs and the backs of 21 large signs that could
only be read by eastbound drivers. A construction worker in the
right-hand, eastbound lane, testified that when he saw defendant driving
toward him, he blew his Mack truck\'s air horn for three or four
seconds, but defendant just kept going. Other witnesses testified that
cars were veering out of defendant\'s way but that defendant made no
attempt to brake or to avoid other vehicles.

Near exit 13, defendant crashed head-on into a Jeep without slowing
down, killing the Jeep\'s driver, Leslie Burgess, instantly. Defendant
was placed under arrest and his blood alcohol content was measured at
.19%. In a subsequent inventory search of his vehicle, police found 9
millimeter ammunition in the trunk, as well as an unloaded 9 millimeter
handgun in the car. The gun was later determined to be the same one that
had fired the [**\[ ...

shots in the parking lot earlier that evening. A small plastic bag
containing cocaine was also found inside defendant\'s vehicle.

Defense counsel argued to the jury during opening and closing statements
that they had to determine whether McPherson had been capable of
perceiving the risk presented by his behavior and purposely ignored that
risk. In addition, when discussing how to formulate an appropriate jury
charge on depraved indifference, the trial court specifically raised
[*People v Feingold* (7 NY3d 288
\[2006\])](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5157761016903719042&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
and asked the parties whether the holding of that case was applicable if
defendant was oblivious to his surroundings by virtue of his voluntary
intoxication. Defense counsel, however, failed to move to dismiss the
depraved indifference murder charge on that basis. The jury was
instructed that it must consider whether defendant was intoxicated to
such a degree that he was incapable of forming the mental state of
depraved indifference.

Defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree, vehicular
manslaughter in the first degree, aggravated driving while intoxicated,
operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, criminal
possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a
controlled substance in the seventh degree. The Appellate Division
affirmed, finding defendant\'s argument that the evidence was legally
insufficient to support his conviction unpreserved for review and, in
any event, without merit (89 AD3d 752 \[2d Dept 2011\]). **\[ ... \]**

 

## Depraved Indifference

 

As we held in [*People v Feingold* (7 NY3d 288
\[2006\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5157761016903719042&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
depraved indifference is a culpable mental state. That mental state \"is
best understood as an utter disregard for the value of human life---a
willingness to act not because one intends harm, but because one simply
doesn\'t care whether grievous harm results or not\" ([*Feingold,* 7
NY3d at
296](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5157761016903719042&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)

citation omitted\]). Circumstantial evidence can be used to establish
the necessary mens rea (*see* [*Feingold,* 7 NY3d at
296](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5157761016903719042&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

The defendant in *Feingold* had been convicted of reckless endangerment
in the first degree---recklessly engaging in conduct that creates a
grave risk of death to others, under circumstances evincing a depraved
indifference to human life. Feingold had attempted suicide by blowing
out the pilot light of his stove and turning on the gas. However, a
spark from the refrigerator caused an explosion, resulting in structural
damage to his apartment building. Although we recognized that, viewed in
the light most favorable to the People, the evidence could have
supported the conclusion that defendant had the necessary mens rea, the
trial judge\'s express finding that the defendant\'s state of mind did
not reflect depraved indifference foreclosed such a determination in
that case (*see* [*Feingold,* 7 NY3d at
295](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5157761016903719042&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

More recently, in [*People v Valencia* (14 NY3d 927
\[2010\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16283812687513394978&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
we addressed a fact pattern similar to the cases at issue. After
spending the evening drinking at a friend\'s house, the defendant drove
in the wrong direction on a Long Island parkway at a high rate of speed,
for about four miles. He crashed into two oncoming vehicles, causing
serious physical injury to the drivers. Valencia\'s blood alcohol
concentration was measured at.21%. We held that there was legally
insufficient evidence to support the conviction for first degree
(depraved indifference) assault, noting that \"\[t\]he trial evidence
established only that defendant was extremely intoxicated and did not
establish that he acted with the culpable mental state of depraved
indifference\" ([14 NY3d at
927-928](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16283812687513394978&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

*Valencia* is, however, distinguishable from the present cases. There,
the trial judge, as the factfinder, determined that the defendant had
been \"oblivious\" to the risks caused by his drunk driving at the time
of the offense, but nevertheless convicted him of depraved indifference
assault based simply on his earlier acts of drinking to the point of
extreme intoxication, despite defendant\'s awareness that he would be
driving in that condition later that evening (*see* [14 NY3d at 928
\[Graffeo, J.,
concurring\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16283812687513394978&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
To the contrary, in each of the instant appeals, the jury was asked to
decide whether the defendant was incapable of forming the requisite
mental state by reason of his or her intoxication and each jury rejected
the argument that defendant\'s impairment rose to that level. Further,
none of the instant appeals presents the question of whether the mens
rea of depraved indifference must be contemporaneous with the actus reus
of the offense.

[**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p276)In
[*People v Prindle* (16 NY3d 768
\[2011\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17460448985038114899&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
the defendant led the police on a high speed chase after attempting to
steal two snow plows and ultimately crashed into another vehicle,
killing one of its occupants. We reduced the defendant\'s depraved
indifference murder conviction to manslaughter in the second degree.
Observing that the jury had been instructed, without objection,
according to the pre-*Feingold* standard of [*People v Register* (60
NY2d 270
\[1983\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9019321014077082981&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
we found that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the
determination that defendant had demonstrated a depraved indifference to
human life (*see* [*Prindle,* 16 NY3d at
771](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17460448985038114899&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
We compared Prindle\'s case to [*People v Gomez* (65 NY2d 9, 12
\[1985\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7113474208054169797&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
where, after striking two cars, the defendant drove on the sidewalk,
struck and killed one child, refused his passenger\'s pleas to apply the
brakes, continued to accelerate and struck another child on the
sidewalk. By contrast, Prindle, although plainly driving in an unsafe
manner, had been actively attempting to avoid hitting other vehicles.

These cases demonstrate that cases involving a depraved indifference to
human life are highly fact-specific and dependent upon the individual
defendant\'s particular mental state---a factor that may be extremely
difficult to establish. Indeed, intoxicated driving cases in general,
although clearly examples of dangerous behavior, are not thought of as
\"quintessential\" cases of depraved indifference---such as,

> \"firing into a crowd; driving an automobile along a crowded sidewalk
> at high speed; opening the lion\'s cage at the zoo; placing a time
> bomb in a public place; poisoning a well from which people are
> accustomed to draw water; opening a drawbridge as a train is about to
> pass over it and dropping stones from an overpass onto a busy
> highway\" ([*People v Suarez,* 6 NY3d 202, 214
> \[2005\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11568638882836472199&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
> \[citations omitted\]).

Recognizing that \"it is important that law enforcement and prosecutors
have the tools necessary to properly charge and convict \[those\] who
have committed a DWI resulting in personal injury or death\" (Senate
Introducer Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 345 at 8), the
legislature has enacted the aggravated vehicular homicide and assault
statutes (Penal Law §§ 125.14, 120.04-a), which provide for enhanced
punishment of those individuals who cause death or serious physical
injury while operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, when, for
example, the individual has a blood alcohol content of at least.18.
These statutes, however, do not foreclose the possibility of [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p277)
prosecution for depraved indifference murder where egregious
circumstances warrant that charge, as they do here.

\"A verdict is legally sufficient when, viewing the facts in a light
most favorable to the People, there is a valid line of reasoning and
permissible inferences from which a rational jury could have found the
elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt\" ([*People v
Danielson,* 9 NY3d 342, 349
\[2007\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13242245525506328743&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
\[internal quotation marks and citations omitted\]). The reviewing court
must \"marshal competent facts most favorable to the People and
determine whether, as a matter of law, a jury could logically conclude
that the People sustained its burden of proof\" ([*Danielson,* 9 NY3d at
349](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13242245525506328743&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

When viewed in the light most favorable to the People, there was legally
sufficient evidence to support Heidgen\'s convictions for depraved
indifference murder. The jury could have determined that defendant was
unhappy and self-destructive. Defendant\'s friends who observed him at
the party thought that he was intoxicated but not so intoxicated that he
was incoherent, unsteady on his feet or slurring his speech. Heidgen
drove the wrong way on the highway for over two miles without reacting
to other drivers coming at him, car horns, or wrong way signage. Perhaps
most significantly, more than one witness testified that defendant
appeared to follow, or track, the headlights of oncoming vehicles. In
addition, the toxicologist testified that defendant\'s blood alcohol
level would have caused delayed reaction time, but that it would not
have rendered him incapable of reacting at all. Based on this evidence,
the jury could have found that, despite defendant\'s intoxication, he
perceived his surroundings. The jury could have reasonably concluded
that defendant drove, knowing that he was on the wrong side of the road
and with an appreciation of the grave risks involved in that
behavior.[^\[5\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#%5B5%5D)
One who engages in what amounts to a high speed game of chicken, with
complete disregard for the value of the lives that are thereby
endangered, is undoubtedly an individual whose culpability is the
equivalent of an intentional murderer.

The evidence is likewise legally sufficient to support Taylor\'s
conviction for depraved indifference murder. Taylor**\[ ... \]** buckled
her seat belt and set out to drive as fast as she could go. She
proceeded at speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour on a local road,
without lights, at times on the wrong side of the street. Her statements
to police revealed that she had perceived at least some of the obstacles
in her path, notably the pedestrian victim prior to striking him.
Taylor\'s behavior was obviously
frenzied,[^\[6\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#%5B6%5D)
but it is also clear that she was aware of her surroundings. From the
above evidence, the jury could have concluded that defendant recklessly
engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of death to others, with an
utter disregard for whether any harm came to those she imperiled.

For the same reasons, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish
that Taylor was guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree. As
defendant herself observes, there was no change in her mental state
between the time she struck the pedestrian and when she hit the other
vehicle. Rather, after colliding with pedestrian Simon, she proceeded at
full speed.

**\[ ... \]**

Perhaps the most difficult aspect of all of these cases is whether there
was sufficient evidence that the defendants were aware of and
appreciated the risks caused by their behavior--- specifically, as to
Heidgen and McPherson, that they knew they were driving on the wrong
side of the parkway and proceeded regardless. However, as noted above,
each jury rejected the conclusion that the defendant was too intoxicated
to form the requisite intent. Despite defendants\' seemingly
inexplicable behavior, the People simply are not required to provide a
motive for their conduct. Rather, depraved indifference can be proved
circumstantially. Here, in each case, a rational jury could have found
that the defendant, emboldened by alcohol or drugs, appreciated that he
or she was engaging in conduct that presented a grave risk of death and
totally disregarded that risk, with catastrophic consequences.

**\[ ... \]**

We have considered defendants\' remaining arguments and find them to be
without merit.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division in each case should be
affirmed.

SMITH, J. (dissenting).

We have said several times that depraved indifference to human life is a
very unusual state of mind (*see* [*People v Lewie,* 17 NY3d 348, 359
\[2011\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13599698556085885033&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*People v Suarez,* 6 NY3d 202, 212
\[2005\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11568638882836472199&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*People v Payne,* 3 NY3d 266, 270
\[2004\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4943291711724109055&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
But experience shows that juries, especially in cases with inflammatory
facts, will often find depraved indifference where the evidence does not
support it, and as a result we have reversed many convictions in recent
years because the proof of this mens rea was insufficient (*see*
[*People v Barboni,* 21 NY3d
393,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1954181469820716988&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
408 n \[2013, Smith, J., concurring\] \[collecting cases\]).

Cases in which intoxicated drivers kill innocent people are among the
most inflammatory, and thus among the most likely to generate depraved
indifference murder convictions where a conviction of a lesser (but
still serious) crime is all that is warranted. These three cases, to my
mind, exemplify that problem. The majority says \"intoxicated driving
cases that present circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to
human life are likely to be few and far between\" (majority op at
267)---yet today it affirms all three of these convictions. In doing so,
it departs from the rigor we have previously shown and makes it more
difficult to attain our long-sought goal of reserving convictions of
this crime for the very few cases that warrant them.

I find the evidence in all three cases insufficient to support murder
convictions. My reasoning differs as between the *Heidgen* and
*McPherson* cases on the one hand, and *Taylor* on the other.

 

## I

 

*Heidgen* and *McPherson* are very similar **\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**. The
simplest and likeliest inference from the evidence is that both men were
so drunk that they did not know what they were doing. Why, after all,
would anyone do such a dangerous thing on purpose?

Of course, Heidgen\'s and McPherson\'s drunkenness does not excuse what
they did. They were unforgivably reckless in getting [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p282)
on the highway at all in the condition they were in, and the
consequences of their recklessness were horrible. They were
unquestionably guilty of manslaughter in the second degree, a class C
felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison (Penal Law §§ 125.15
\[1\]; 70.00 \[2\] \[c\]), and under today\'s statutes they would also
be guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide, a class B felony punishable
by up to 25 years (Penal Law §§ 125.14 \[1\], \[4\]; 70.00 \[2\] \[b\]).
But it is clear, and the majority implicitly recognizes, that unless
these two defendants knew they were driving the wrong way they were not
guilty of depraved indifference murder. In the absence of such
knowledge, their conduct does not show \"depraved indifference to human
life\" (Penal Law § 125.25 \[2\]), which we have defined to mean \"an
utter disregard for the value of human life---a willingness to act \...
because one simply doesn\'t care whether grievous harm results or not\"
(majority op at 274, quoting [*People v Feingold,* 7 NY3d 288, 296
\[2006\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5157761016903719042&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
*see* [*People v Valencia,* 14 NY3d 927
\[2010\])](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16283812687513394978&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0).

The majority decides that the jury could have found that Heidgen and
McPherson \"knew they were driving on the wrong side of the parkway and
proceeded regardless\" (majority op at 279). I agree that, if that
happened, these defendants could be found guilty of depraved
indifference murder; and perhaps it did happen---but I do not see how a
rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that it did. Anyone
who knowingly drives the wrong way on a divided highway must either have
chosen a bizarre way of committing suicide or else be prey to some
grandiose illusion that all the other cars will get out of his way.
These records contain no more than hints that either Heidgen or
McPherson was in such an extraordinary state of mind.

**\[ ... \]**

The majority relies more heavily on the testimony of two witnesses that,
the majority says, would justify a finding that Heidgen engaged \"in
what amounts to a high speed game of chicken\" (majority op at 277). One
of the witnesses said that, when the [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p283)witness\'s
own car \"drifted a little to the left \.... it appeared as if
\[Heidgen\'s\] car was drifting with me.\" Another, a passenger in the
limousine that Heidgen crashed into, testified that Heidgen\'s car
\"moved \... toward us \.... seemed to follow us.\" This *could* mean
that Heidgen was deliberately aiming his car at the others, but I do not
see how a reasonable juror could infer, with the confidence necessary to
support a criminal conviction, that that is what he was doing. It is an
extremely unusual thing to do.

As to McPherson, the evidence of a depraved state of mind is even
thinner. It is a fair inference from the record that, before he started
to drive, McPherson was angry at his girlfriend and fired several
gunshots (not, so far as the record shows, at anyone or anything in
particular). This simply does not prove that McPherson was either
suicidal or on a near-insane pursuit of thrills---as he would have to be
to drive knowingly the wrong way. It is much more likely that, in his
drunken rage, he did not focus on his surroundings after he started
driving.

As to both Heidgen and McPherson, the majority suggests that the very
fact that they did drive the wrong way for miles, ignoring many signs
and other events that should have alerted them, supports an inference
that they knew what they were doing. To me, it supports more strongly
the inference that---as blood tests proved---they were very drunk.
Ignoring warnings that would alert a sober person is what drunk people
do. I do not doubt that, as the majority says, a drunk person is not
biologically incapable of perceiving and reacting to his surroundings,
but anyone who has ever met one knows that they often fail to do so.

I find the *Heidgen* and *McPherson* cases to be indistinguishable from
[*People v Valencia* (14 NY3d 927
\[2010\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16283812687513394978&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
another case involving a drunken wrong-way driver. The majority
distinguishes *Valencia* on the ground that there was, in that case, a
finding of fact that defendant was oblivious to the risks he was running
(majority op at 275). But our memorandum in *Valencia* does not rely on,
or even mention, that finding; it says the evidence was \"insufficient\"
to support a finding of depraved indifference. If it was insufficient
there, it is insufficient here.

**\[ ... \]**

 

## II

 

I would also reduce Taylor\'s conviction, but hers is a different sort
of case.

While we can only guess what was in Heidgen\'s and McPherson\'s minds
when they committed their crimes, there is considerable evidence of what
Taylor was thinking. **\[ ... \]**

On this record, a reasonable juror could infer beyond a reasonable doubt
that Taylor chose to drive at a very high speed, that she knew that she
might hit someone, and that she was unmoved by that risk. If she were
not so obviously mentally impaired, it might be reasonable to conclude
from these facts that she was depravedly indifferent to human life. But
in my view, those words simply cannot be applied to someone so unhinged.

I do not suggest that Taylor was legally insane (though I am somewhat
surprised she did not raise an insanity defense), or [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15856180742370057677&scilh=0#p285)that
she had an extreme emotional disturbance as that term is used in the
Penal Law (§ 125.25 \[1\] \[a\]; such a disturbance reduces what would
otherwise be intentional murder to manslaughter, but is not mentioned in
the depraved indifference murder statute). Still, it is hardly debatable
that, even by comparison with other intoxicated drivers, Taylor was in a
highly abnormal condition. Depraved indifference---the willingness to
risk harm because one simply does not care---is a more clear-sighted and
cold-blooded state of mind than the one this record shows. I would
therefore reduce Taylor\'s conviction, as well as Heidgen\'s and
McPherson\'s, to second degree manslaughter.

retreat from *Register* (*see generally* [*Feingold,* 7 NY3d at

219 \[2005, Read, J., concurring in result on constraint; Graffeo, J.,
dissenting\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11568638882836472199&q=22+N.Y.3d+259&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
But the Court ultimately decided that depraved indifference is a
culpable mental state; that recklessness, no matter how extreme, is not
enough by itself to support a conviction for the crime of depraved
indifference murder. Under *Register,* by contrast, a conviction for
depraved indifference murder hinged upon an objective assessment of the
degree of risk presented by the defendant\'s reckless conduct.

Essentially, the majority has resurrected the *Register* standard for
cases in which intoxicated drivers kill innocent people, or at least has
done so here in order to salvage these three convictions. But any
departure from *Feingold* for drunk driving cases is contrary not only
to our precedent, but also to legislative intent. The legislature in
2007---just a year after we decided *Feingold*---amended the Penal Law
to create the new crime of aggravated vehicular homicide, a class B
felony with a penalty of up to 25 years in prison (*see* Penal Law §
125.14; *see also* L [**\[ ...

This crime occurs when an individual kills someone while driving with
ability impaired by alcohol or drugs, along with the presence of at
least one of the following factors: a blood alcohol content of .18 or
higher; a DWI conviction within the previous 10 years; the crash caused
the death of more than a single person; the crash killed one person and
severely injured another; a previous conviction under Penal Law articles
120 or 125 involving the operation of a motor vehicle; the crash caused
the death of a passenger in the offender\'s vehicle who was a child of
15 years of age or less; or the offender was driving with a suspended or
revoked license from any state.

In fashioning this crime, the legislature was, at least in part,
responding to prosecutors\' pleas that \"\[r\]ecent court decisions
\[i.e., *Feingold* and the decisions leading up to it\] ha\[d\] *so
limited the application of the depraved indifference statutes to
vehicular crimes as to make them inapplicable*\"; and
\"\[p\]erversely,\" a driver might as a result try to defend against
such a charge by using a claim of extreme intoxication to negate the
newly required culpable mental state (*id.* at 15-16, June 15, 2007

Depraved-Indifference Murder; New Legislation?,* NYLJ, Apr. 4, 2005 at
26, col 1 \[exploring the implications of the Court\'s evolving depraved
indifference jurisprudence for the intoxication defense\]).

In sum, the legislature has addressed the proper standards for assessing
the culpability of drunk drivers who cause fatalities, and the proper
measure of their punishment. And it did not choose to do so by amending
the second-degree murder statute, which the majority now reinterprets so
as to uphold these convictions for depraved indifference murder.

In each case: Order affirmed.

Defendant was convicted of the murder of a 20-year-old girl who was
pinned between a moving subway train and the subway platform as a result
of his unsuccessful attempt to snatch her purse from his position
between cars of the moving train. In convicting the defendant of felony
murder, the jury necessarily found that he had attempted to rob his
victim. On appeal defendant argues, *inter alia*, that purse snatching
cannot be considered anything more than a larceny, which is not one of
the felonies enumerated in the felony murder statute (Penal Law, §
125.25, subd 3). We reject this contention and hold that the method of
purse snatching here employed did constitute the crime of
robbery.[^\[1\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#%5B1%5D)

The facts adduced at the trial may be briefly summarized. The victim,
Regina Graham, left her Brooklyn home on the morning of November 30,
1970 to buy a birthday present for her brother. That same morning
defendant met a friend named Samaniego, who was about to travel from
Brooklyn into Manhattan by subway to pick up his girlfriend. Defendant
told Samaniego that he intended to \"snatch one on the way uptown.\"
Samaniego understood defendant to mean that he intended to snatch a
pocketbook. Defendant and Samaniego boarded a subway train at Utica
Avenue.

Defendant and his friend changed trains at Nevins Street. Samaniego sat
down in the forward end of one of the cars toward the rear of the train.
Shortly before the subway train pulled out of the station, defendant
left Samaniego, ran toward the rear of the car, opened the door leading
to the next car and disappeared from view. A passenger seated across
from Samaniego observed Regina Graham standing on the platform in front
of the door which was about to close.

The train started to move and the conductor, who was looking toward the
rear of the train, saw an arm stick out from between two cars. The arm
had Regina Graham by the pocketbook or the coat and was pulling her
down. With the momentum of the train, she \"started to move forward\"
and the arm was \"still on her person\" as she started to stumble. The
conductor pulled the emergency cord to stop the train, but the girl\'s
leg had already become wedged between the train and the platform.

[**\[ ...

seconds after the train had stopped, defendant reentered the car in
which Samaniego was seated and sat down next to him. He told Samaniego
he had \"missed the pocketbook\" and that the \"lady went down.\" He
then told Samaniego to switch jackets with him and the exchange was
made. The two of them then walked through several cars heading towards
the forward end of the train. The conventional entrance-exit doors of
the train were all closed, so defendant and Samaniego exited the train
by going between two cars and lifting the chain safety gate between the
cars. They boarded another train, re-exchanged jackets and rode into
Manhattan, where Samaniego got off to meet his girlfriend.

Regina Graham suffered extensive \"crushing injuries\" of the pelvic
area and both legs; three-quarters of the last car had apparently passed
over her body before the train was stopped. She died 11 days later as a
result of her injuries.

The sole defense was insanity. Defendant told one psychiatrist that he
had learned to snatch purses from subway trains at the age of six and
that he had been using this technique for 12 years. On an average day he
might steal as many as seven or eight purses during rush hour. Defendant
also told the psychiatrist that he feels depressed when he does not rob.
In addition, the expert witness testified that he had learned, from
defense counsel, that defendant used to bring pocketbooks home to his
mother and that she would take part of the money and let him keep the
rest. It was the conclusion of this expert, as well as that of a second
psychiatrist called by the defense, that defendant has a compulsion to
steal purses and that he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the
nature and consequences of what he was doing on November 30, 1970.

The expert called by the People in rebuttal testified, in essence, that
defendant had a bad habit, not a compulsion. He described defendant as a
sociopath with chronic delinquent urges, who knew the danger and quality
of the act and that it was wrong.

Following this testimony, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on
the ground that the People had failed to prove that he used \"physical
force\" and that, therefore, he could not be guilty of attempted robbery
(see Penal Law, § 160.00) or of felony murder (see Penal Law, § 125.25,
subd 3). Defendant\'s mode of operation was likened to that of a
pickpocket. The motion was denied; the trial court indicated that the
question [**\[ ...

whether robbery had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt would be
submitted to the jury. The elements of robbery were charged to the jury,
which returned a verdict of guilty of felony murder.

On appeal defendant again likens his actions to those of a pickpocket
and contends that the proof was insufficient to establish felony murder.
Viewed in a light most favorable to the *People*\'s case (see [*People v
Monaco*, 14 N.Y.2d
43](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10117141176036806579&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);

698](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16227422888756020943&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)),
the evidence was sufficient to establish, under any generally accepted
standard, that Regina Graham\'s death was the result of an attempted
robbery. Moreover, we hold, as a matter of law, that the *modus
operandi* here employed constitutes \"physical force\" within the
meaning of the robbery statute (see Penal Law, § 160.00).

Those few New York cases which have discussed \"purse snatching\" are
generally in accord with the rule followed by most jurisdictions, viz.,
a snatching unaccompanied by any resistance is not sufficient to
constitute a robbery (*McCloskey v People*, 5 Parker Cr Rep 299; see,
also, *People v Hall*, 6 Parker Cr Rep 642; [*People v McGinty*, 24 Hun
62](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=14173206449196804744&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
Purse Snatching as Robbery or Theft, Ann. 42 ALR3d 1381). The rule in
New York was formulated against the backdrop of a 10-year mandatory
minimum sentence of imprisonment for robbery in the first degree (Rev
Stat of NY, part IV, ch I, tit III § 71 \[1875 ed\], § 57 \[1852
ed\])[^\[2\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#%5B2%5D)
and was enunciated in cases which involved the most innocuous of fact
patterns. Thus, in *McCloskey v People* *(supra)*, the defendant met the
complainant in a bar and both had been drinking. They left the bar and,
as they were walking along the street \"in a friendly manner\", the
defendant reached into the complainant\'s pocket and took some coins.
\"No more force was used than sufficient to pull the money out of the
pocket of the \[complaining\] witness\" (5 Parker Cr Rep, at p 307). The
complainant \"evidently considered and treated the \* \* \*
\[defendant\'s\] conduct as a joke.\" He made no resistance \"and
yielded neither to force or fear\" (5 Parker Cr Rep, at p 308). At the
trial the court charged that if the force used were sufficient to make
out an assault and battery, there would be a robbery. It further charged
that if the jurors believed the complainant, they must find the
defendant guilty of robbery. On appeal it
[576\*576](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#p576)
was held that \"\[t\]he mere snatching anything from the hand or the
person of any one, without any struggle or resistance by the owner, or
any force or violence on the part of the thief, will not constitute
robbery\" (5 Parker Cr Rep, at p 306). It was further held that it was
error to equate a simple assault and battery with robbery and that a
greater degree of violence is necessary to make out a robbery. Examples
of such a greater degree of violence, taken from English cases, were
used --- e.g., it is a robbery when an earring is taken with such
violence as to lacerate the ear of the wearer, or where a diamond hair
ornament is pulled with such force as to tear a part of a lady\'s hair
from her head.

*People v Hall* (6 Parker Cr Rep 642, *supra*) involved an apparent
misunderstanding about a watch between two men who knew each other. The
defendant complained to a constable, who told the complainant to stop
and that he had better return defendant\'s watch if he had it. The
complainant told the constable to search him. The constable took a watch
out of the complainant\'s pocket and showed it to the defendant, who
said it was not his watch. Nonetheless, defendant asked the constable if
he could hold it. The constable complied and then asked the complainant
whether he had another watch. The complainant took another one out of
his pocket --- this one was attached to a chain. The defendant said that
it was not his either, but yanked the watch loose from the chain and
said: \"\`Damn him, I\'ve got two for one --- let him go\'\" (6 Parker
Cr Rep, at p 644). Defendant was convicted of robbery, but a new trial
was ordered because the court had charged that the degree of violence
used was sufficient to warrant finding the defendant guilty of the
offense. The court stated (p 652): The especial heinousness of the
offense of robbery over simple larceny, consists in the terror and fear
inspired, and in the apprehension and *danger of injury to the person*
involved in the commission of the offense \* \* \* There must be such
force employed, or such degree of force, as shall overcome the free
agency or power of resistance of the person despoiled\" (emphasis
supplied).

Finally, in [*People v McGinty* (24 Hun 62,
63,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=14173206449196804744&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra*), defendant was charged with robbery after he knocked a man\'s
pockebook out of his hand in a bar and then physically threw him out of
the door. The charge to the jury was that \"if the force which was used
was sufficient to deprive complainant of his property against his will,
that would be sufficient to
[577\*577](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#p577)
constitute the violence to the person\" necessary to prove robbery (p
63). The court held that to be error, noting that a pickpocket who
steals a handkerchief uses sufficient force to deprive the owner of his
property. The court further held (p 64) that the violence necessary to
make out robbery \"generally implied the overcoming, or attempting to
overcome, an actual resistance\".

These cases have limited precedential value because of the harsh
sentencing laws at the time they were decided and their peculiar facts.
No District Attorney would now seek a robbery indictment on the facts of
*McCloskey* or *Hall* --- the courts therein were obviously grappling
with hypertechnical definitions of force. Thus, *McCloskey* involved the
question whether a simple \"unpermitted touching\" --- a technical
assault --- constituted sufficient force, while it appears that the
defendant in *Hall* was faced with a robbery conviction principally
because the \"second\" watch was yanked from a chain, a number of
English cases having held that where a chain or pendant was broken
during the course of a snatching, the act constituted robbery. As for
*McGinty*, the result would probably be different today since, by
statute, the element of physical force may be satisfied by the use of
physical force \"immediately after the taking\" for the purpose of
retaining the stolen property (see Penal Law, § 160.00, subd 1; see,
also, [*People v Beebe*, 70 Mich App
154,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=13244707942512540513&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
for a full discussion of the law with respect to *when* the element of
force must occur --- most jurisdictions now consider the totality of a
\"transaction\" in deciding whether an actor\'s conduct may be termed a
robbery). Even in the early cases it was recognized that the overcoming
of any resistance would be sufficient force to constitute a robbery.

In a majority of the other jurisdictions, the same general rules apply.
Thus, \"a sudden taking or snatching may be accompanied by sufficient
force to constitute robbery\" (Ann. 42 ALR3d 1381, 1385, § 5\[a\];

snatching is not looked upon as a taking by force, it is otherwise where
there is a struggle to keep the property\]).

The \"majority rule\" has been criticized on the ground that it
\"put\[s\] a premium on criminal skill and adroitness\", since the thief
who is clumsy or slow enough to enable his victim to resist faces a more
severe penalty than the more \"professional\" snatcher (Note, 23 J Crim
Law 113, 115). A few jurisdictions have held that a snatching of
property from the victim is sufficient to constitute a robbery
regardless of the victim\'s resistance or lack thereof ([*Jones v
Commonwealth*, 112 Ky
689](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=13308900712855269412&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);

the court concluded from the evidence that the grabbing of the
pocketbook from the complainant\'s hand \"was probably done so quickly
that he had no chance to actively resist\". Nevertheless, it held that
this constituted sufficient force to make out the elements of
robbery**\[ ... \]**) The \"minority\" rule was most recently adopted by
the Massachusetts Supreme Court in [*Commonwealth v Jones* (362 Mass 83,
88-89),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7310267710677580893&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
wherein the following observations were made: \"We prefer the Kentucky
rule on purse snatching. The majority jurisdiction rule, in looking to
whether or not the victim resists \* \* \* wrongly emphasizes the
victim\'s opportunity to defend himself over the willingness of the
purse snatcher to use violence if necessary. See Note, 23 J. Cr. Law,
111, 115. Historically, however, the law has singled out the robber from
other thieves because of his readiness to inflict bodily injury upon his
victims. \[Citing Am. Law Inst., Model Penal Code, § 222.1, Comment
(Tent. Draft No. 11, 1960).\] \* \* \* Clearly, more is involved than in
a mere stealthy taking where the victim has no present realization of
the theft. See Anderson, Wharton\'s Criminal Law & Procedure, § 560.\"

On this record, it is unnecessary for this court to make a [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#p579)determination
as to whether purse snatching, per se, constitutes a robbery. Suffice it
to say that there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that
the victim resisted by clinging to her purse and that the overcoming of
this resistance, through the use of the overwhelming momentum of the
train, constituted a robbery by any definition of that
term.[^\[3\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#%5B3%5D)

Even assuming that there was no resistance, the extreme danger created
by defendant\'s method of operation must be classified as such an
aggravated form of theft as would constitute a robbery. A robbery is
committed \"when, in the course of committing a larceny \* \* \* \[one\]
uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another
person for the purpose of \* \* \* \[p\]reventing or overcoming
resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof
immediately after the taking\" (Penal Law, § 160.00, subd 1). In
considering what degree of physical force is sufficient to constitute a
robbery, it should be borne in mind that the law of robbery, and indeed
other forms of aggravated theft, developed \"to protect not only against
misappropriation \[of property\] but also against injuries which may
result from peculiarly dangerous means devised for accomplishing
misappropriation\" (Note, 54 Col L Rev 84). \"Regardless of the success
of the misappropriation, aggravated theft is always accompanied by the
possibility of physical or psychic injury to the victim \* \* \* To the
extent that the method of perpetration increases the likelihood of the
misappropriation or of physical and mental harm to the victim, severer
punishments must be meted out\" (Note, 54 Col L Rev 84, 109).

Defendant\'s method not only increased his chances of a successful
\"misappropriation\" of property, it was accompanied, as well, by the
possibility of severe physical injury to the victim. It could not be
predicted whether a bag would be plucked with ease or whether, as here,
the victim would resist and be dragged along with the train; nor should
it make any difference for the purposes of penal classification. We
conclude that the defendant used physical force, by means of the forward
momentum of a moving train, to prevent or overcome [**\[ ...

to the taking of Regina Graham\'s pocketbook (see Penal Law, § 160.00).
As a result thereof, his victim suffered injuries which resulted in her
death. Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of murder should
be affirmed (see Penal Law, § 125.25, subd 3).

We have considered the other points raised by defendant on this appeal
and have found them to be without merit.

SHAPIRO, J. (dissenting).

Defendant has been sentenced to a term of 15 years to life upon a jury
verdict convicting him of felony murder.

Upon this appeal he raises four issues. Only one of them, in my opinion,
merits discussion, and that is whether, as a matter of fact, the proof
was sufficient to establish the underlying felony --- attempted robbery
--- as a predicate for defendant\'s conviction of felony murder. I do
not believe it was.

Felony murder is defined in section 125.25 of the Penal Law, in relevant
part, as follows: \"3. Acting either alone or with one or more other
persons, *he commits or attempts to commit robbery*, burglary,
kidnapping, arson, rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree,
sexual abuse in the first degree, escape in the first degree, or escape
in the second degree, and, in the course of and in furtherance of such
crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if
there be any, causes the death of a person other than one of the
participants\" (emphasis supplied). (At the time the crime was
committed, there was only one degree of \"murder\" in the New York Penal
Law. At the present time, section 125.25 of the Penal Law is entitled
murder in the second degree.)

Robbery is defined in section 160.00 of the Penal Law. That statute
provides:

> \"Robbery is forcible stealing. A person forcibly steals property and
> commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses
> or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person
> for the purpose of:
>
> \"1. Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property
> or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or
>
> \"2. Compelling the owner of such property or another person to
> deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in
> the commission of the larceny.\"

The facts, briefly stated, show that one Regina Graham,
[581\*581](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#p581)
aged 20, fell off a subway platform and was injured by a moving train at
about 12:45 P.M. on November 30, 1970. She died of her injuries 11 days
later. The train conductor, Robert Simmons, had just closed the train
doors, after looking in both directions of the platform from his cab in
the sixth car of the train to make sure the doors were clear. As the
train began to move and Simmons glanced to the rear of the train once
more, he saw a forearm extended from the train (from between two cars,
because the doors were closed), pulling at a young woman, either by her
pocketbook *or* her arm. The thief missed his quarry, but the woman
began to stumble toward the edge of the platform. Simmons, inside his
cab, pulled the emergency cord. One of the passengers on the train,
Steven Wiley, gave his name and address to the police. What Wiley had
seen was two young men in a rear car of the train. One of the young men
(identified by him as the defendant) raced through the car just as the
train started to move, opened the door between the cars and closed it
behind him. When the train stopped suddenly, he returned and exchanged
jackets with his companion. There is no doubt that the defendant is the
person who attempted, unsuccessfully, to snatch the decedent\'s
pocketbook.

Although, unfortunately, a death resulted from what defendant did, the
undisputed facts in this record reveal no more than an attempted snatch
of a pocketbook and not an attempted robbery, as that term is defined in
the applicable statutes. Pocketbook snatching constitutes a larceny
(*McCloskey v People*, 5 Parker Cr Rep 299), which is not by statutory
definition a crime upon which a felony murder charge can be predicated
(cf. [*People v Woods*, 41 N.Y.2d
279](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11871889501658173907&q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

I am not persuaded by the ruling of the trial court that the moving
train became an element of the physical force applied by the offender so
as to bring the defendant\'s conduct within the statutory definition of
an attempted robbery, or of the contention of the People in their brief
that the appellant, in relying on the forward momentum of the train to
create physical force to assist his theft, was guilty of a robbery. In
my opinion, the majority, by sustaining the conviction in this case, is
making bad law in a hard case. I would reverse and dismiss the
indictment.[^\[\*\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+62+A.D.2d+572&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=4298101587155313948&scilh=0#%5B4%5D)

This appeal raises the question whether a conviction of felony murder
under Penal Law § 125.25 (3) should be sustained where the homicide
victim, a police officer, was shot not by one of the defendants but by a
fellow officer during a gun battle following defendants\' attempted
robbery. Under the [**\[ ...

circumstances presented, we conclude that it should, and we therefore
affirm.

 

## I

 

Defendants Santana and Hernandez conspired to ambush and rob a man who
was coming to a New York City apartment building to buy drugs. The plan
was to have Santana lure him into the building stairwell where Hernandez
waited with a gun. In fact, the man was an undercover State Trooper,
wearing a transmitter, and backed up by fellow officers.

Once the Trooper was inside the building, Hernandez accosted him and
pointed a gun at his head. A fight ensued during which the officer
announced that he was a policeman, pulled out his service revolver and
began firing. In the confusion, Hernandez, still armed, ran from the
building into a courtyard where he encountered members of the police
backup unit. They ordered him to halt. Instead, he aimed his gun at one
of the officers and moved toward him. The officers began firing, and
one, Trooper Joseph Aversa, was fatally shot in the head. His body was
found near the area where Hernandez was apprehended after being wounded.
Santana was arrested inside the building.

The evidence at trial did not establish who killed Aversa, but the
People concede that it effectively eliminated the possibility that
either defendant was the shooter. Separate juries were empaneled for the
two cases, and both defendants were convicted of felony murder and other
charges.

On appeal, defendants contend that the felony murder charges should have
been dismissed because neither one of them fired the fatal shot. The
Appellate Division rejected that argument. Even though a fellow officer
shot Aversa, the Court concluded that defendants were properly held
responsible for felony murder because their conduct \"unquestionably
\`forged\' a critical link in the chain of events that led to Trooper
Aversa\'s death\" (186 AD2d 471, 473).

 

## II

 

Some 30 years ago, this Court affirmed the dismissal of a felony murder
charge on the grounds that neither the defendant nor a cofelon had fired
the weapon that caused the deaths ([*People v Wood*, 8 N.Y.2d
48](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
In *Wood*, the defendant and his companions were escaping from a fight
outside a [**\[ ...
\]**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#p313)tavern
when the tavern owner, attempting to aid police, fatally shot a
bystander and one of defendant\'s companions. Defendant was charged with
assault and felony murder. At the time, the relevant provision of
section 1044 of the former Penal Law defined murder in the first degree
as \"\[t\]he killing of a human being \* \* \* without a design to
effect death, by a person engaged in the commission of, or in an attempt
to commit a felony\" (§ 1044 \[2\]). We concluded that by the plain
terms of the statute defendant could not be liable for murder, for the
killing of the two men was not committed by a person \"engaged in the
commission of\" a felony or a felony attempt. Relying on the statute\'s
\"peculiar wording\", we decided the case without addressing whether a
similar result would be required as a matter of common law ([8 NY2d, at
53](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
*see*, [*Commonwealth v Redline*, 391 Pa 486, 137 A2d
472](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17957059063293342523&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
The *Wood* case acknowledged that other jurisdictions differed on
whether to apply a proximate cause theory under which felons could be
held responsible for homicides committed by nonparticipants or an agency
theory under which felons would be responsible only if they committed
the final, fatal act ([*People v Wood*, *supra*, at
51-53](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
*see*, Annotation, *Criminal Liability Where Act of Killing is Done by
One Resisting Felony or Other Unlawful Act Committed by Defendant*, 56
ALR3d 239, 249-261, §§ 4, 5).

In 1965, the Legislature revised the felony murder statute by removing
the language that had been dispositive in *Wood* and replacing it with a
provision holding a person culpable for felony murder when, during the
commission of an enumerated felony or attempt, either the defendant or
an accomplice \"causes the death of a person other than one of the
participants\" (Penal Law § 125.25 \[3\]). Thus, this appeal raises the
question of whether *Wood* remains good law despite the recasting of the
Penal Law. The question is one of first impression for this Court,
although some Appellate Division panels have continued to adhere to the
*Wood* rule that the shooter must be a participant in the underlying
felony (*see, e.g.*, [*People v Castro*, 141 AD2d
658,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4598947853923098236&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*lv denied* 72 N.Y.2d 1044; [*People v Ramos*, 116 AD2d
462](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2446559236321849668&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

The People believe those Appellate Division decisions to be in error.
They premise their argument on the established construction of the term
\"causes the death\", which is now the operative language in the Penal
Law. That term is used consistently throughout article 125 and has been
construed to mean that homicide is properly charged when the
defendant\'s
[314\*314](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#p314)
culpable act is \"a sufficiently direct cause\" of the death so that the
fatal result was reasonably foreseeable ([*People v Kibbe*, 35 N.Y.2d
407,
412](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2146421203254499521&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
*accord*, [*Matter of Anthony M.*, 63 N.Y.2d 270,
280](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13063410025549946687&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*People v Stewart*, 40 N.Y.2d 692,

In the People\'s view the evidence here meets that standard. They
contend that it was highly foreseeable that someone would be killed in a
shootout when Hernandez refused to put down his gun and instead
persisted in threatening the life of one of the back-up officers. Thus,
under the People\'s theory, Hernandez \"caused the death\" of Aversa.
Because his attempt to avoid arrest was in furtherance of a common
criminal objective shared with Santana, the People contend that the
murder was properly attributed to Santana as well as under principles of
accomplice liability (*see*, [*People v Friedman*, 205 N.Y.
161](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=8391452787197189688&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);

In response, defendants assert that [*People v
Wood*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0),
though decided on narrow statutory grounds, states a rule that was
followed for centuries at common law and one that has been embraced by a
significant number of
jurisdictions.[^\[\*\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#%5B1%5D)
The rationale for requiring that one of the cofelons be the shooter (or,
more broadly, the person who commits the final, fatal act) has been
framed in several ways. Some courts have held that when the victim or a
police officer or a bystander shoots and kills, it cannot be said that
the killing was in furtherance of a common criminal objective ([*State v
Severs*, 759 SW2d 935,
938](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3411447324676931413&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
\[Tenn Crim App\]). Others have concluded that under such
[315\*315](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#p315)
circumstances the necessary malice or intent is missing ([*Wooden v
Commonwealth*, 222 Va 758, 284 SE2d
811)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6765564677376487638&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0).
Under the traditional felony murder doctrine, the malice necessary to
make the killing murder was constructively imputed from the *mens rea*
incidental to perpetration of the underlying felony ([*Commonwealth v
Redline*, 391 Pa 486, 493-494, 137 A2d 472,
475,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17957059063293342523&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)*supra*;
IV Blackstone, Commentaries, at 200-201). Thus, in *Wooden*, the
Virginia Supreme Court concluded that where a nonparticipant in the
felony is the shooter, there can be no imputation of the necessary
malice to him, and no party in the causal chain has both the requisite
*mens rea* and culpability for the *actus reus*. Still other courts have
expressed policy concerns about extending felony murder liability. They
have asserted that no deterrence value attaches when the felon is not
the person immediately responsible for the death, or have contended that
an expansive felony murder rule might unreasonably hold the felons
responsible for the acts of others --- for instance, when an unarmed
felon is fleeing the scene and a bystander is hit by the bad aim of the
armed victim (*see*, [*People v Washington*, 62 Cal 2d 777, 781-782, 402
P2d 130,
134](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6992085810275208726&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*State v Bonner*, 330 NC 536, 541-542, 411 SE2d 598,
601](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8650004720372343672&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

 

## III

 

Analysis begins with the statute. The causal language used in our felony
murder provision and elsewhere in the homicide statutes has consistently
been construed by this Court according to the rule in [*People v Kibbe*
(35 N.Y.2d
407,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2146421203254499521&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra*), where we held that the accused need not commit the final,
fatal act to be culpable for causing death. To accept defendants\'
analysis would require that we hold that the phrase \"causes the death\"
in subdivision (3), the felony murder paragraph of section 125.25, means
something entirely different than it does in subdivisions (1) and (2) of
the very same section. That is contrary to the normal rules of statutory
construction (*see*, [*People v Bolden*, 81 N.Y.2d 146,
151](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7790058594860664302&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

That rule of construction must bend, of course, if in fact the
Legislature intended the language to have a unique meaning within the
context of the felony murder provision, but the legislative history of
the 1965 revision reveals nothing about whether the Legislature intended
to overturn [*People v
Wood*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0).
Defendants read that silence to mean that no such substantive change in
the law was envisioned by the Legislature, and they
[316\*316](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#p316)
urge us to reaffirm the common law as it applied to felony murder to
limit liability when a nonparticipant is the killer.

Defendants\' position is problematic for several reasons. First, it asks
us to find in the ambiguous silence of the legislative record grounds
for contradicting the unambiguous language of the statute. Second, it
assumes that the Legislature intended an unusually narrow construction
of the word \"causes\" even though New York homicide decisions had
defined causality more expansively (*see, e.g.*, [*People v Kane*, 213
N.Y. 260,
270](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=18320034487836246259&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
\[error in medical treatment provided to victim does not relieve
attacker of liability\]). It assumes also that in choosing the statutory
language the Legislature and the Temporary State Commission on Revision
of the Penal Law and Criminal Code, which drafted the amended provision,
disregarded the well-defined debate over the difference between
\"causing\" a homicide and \"committing\" a homicide (*see, e.g.*,
Morris, *The Felon\'s Responsibility for the Lethal Acts of Others*, 105
U Pa L Rev 50 \[1956\]). The Legislature could easily have written into
subdivision (3) the limitation endorsed by defendants --- as it did with
the limitation applying to the death of a cofelon --- but it chose not
to do so.

Third and more serious, defendants\' argument is premised on the
assumption that the relevant common law pertaining to felony murder was
uniform and unambiguous at the time the Legislature acted in 1965. In
fact, the leading American case for limiting felony murder liability,
[*Commonwealth v Redline* (391 Pa 486, 137 A2d
472,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17957059063293342523&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra*), which was decided shortly before [*People v
Wood*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0),
*overturned* prior case law in Pennsylvania. Variations on the felony
murder doctrine were widespread in American jurisprudence, with
liability turning on such factors as whether the victim was one of the
felons, whether the felons initiated the gun battle and whether the
deceased had been used as a shield by defendant (*see*, [*People v
Washington*, 62 Cal 2d 777, 402 P2d
130](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6992085810275208726&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0),
*supra*; [*Commonwealth v Redline*,
*supra*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17957059063293342523&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

Nor can it be contended that the limited view of felony murder liability
was clearly the law in New York at the time the Legislature acted. In
[*People v
Wood*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0),
we noted that two of our decisions had incidentally endorsed the idea
that the felon must be the killer (*see*, [*People v Giro*, 197 N.Y.
152](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=9394533169745461526&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
*and* [*People v Udwin*, 254 N.Y.
255](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=7260803539434320460&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)),
but we expressly left open questions concerning \"the application of the
rules of causation and foreseeability\" ([*People v Wood*, *supra*, at
53](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
Earlier, in [*People v Keshner* (304 N.Y.
968),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17451610371036280862&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
[317\*317](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#p317)
we had let stand a felony murder conviction though defendants did not
commit the final, fatal act. In *Keshner*, defendants had plotted to
burn down a building and had spread gasoline in the structure but were
apprehended by police before they could proceed further. Moments later,
an independent force caused the gasoline to ignite, and defendants were
held liable for the deaths of those caught in the blaze.

In light of the statutory language and the case law prior to the
revision, we conclude that the Legislature intended what appears obvious
from the face of the statute: that \"causes\" in the felony murder
provision should be accorded the same meaning it is given in
subdivisions (1) and (2) of section 125.25 of the Penal Law.

Unlike defendants and those courts adopting the so-called agency theory,
we believe New York\'s view of causality, based on a proximate cause
theory, to be consistent with fundamental principles of criminal law.
Advocates of the agency theory suggest that no culpable party has the
requisite *mens rea* when a nonparticipant is the shooter. We disagree.
The basic tenet of felony murder liability is that the *mens rea* of the
underlying felony is imputed to the participant responsible for the
killing ([*People v Wood*, 8 N.Y.2d 48,
51,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11067153566850781951&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra*). By operation of that legal fiction, the transferred intent
allows the law to characterize a homicide, though unintended and not in
the common design of the felons, as an intentional killing (*id.*).
Thus, the presence or absence of the requisite *mens rea* is an issue
turning on whether the felon is acting in furtherance of the underlying
crime at the time of the homicide, not on the proximity or attenuation
of the death resulting from the felon\'s acts. Whether the death is an
immediate result or an attenuated one, the necessary *mens rea* is
present if the causal act is part of the felonious conduct.

No more persuasive is the argument that the proximate cause view will
extend criminal liability unreasonably. First, New York law is clear
that felony murder does not embrace any killing that is coincidental
with the felony but instead is limited to those deaths caused by one of
the felons in furtherance of their crime ([*People v Ryan*, 263 N.Y.
298](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=18046752917729506326&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
More than civil tort liability must be established; criminal liability
will adhere only when the felons\' acts are a sufficiently direct cause
of the death ([*People v Kibbe*, 35 N.Y.2d 407,
412-413,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2146421203254499521&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra*). When the intervening acts of another party are supervening

unforeseeable, the necessary causal chain is broken, and there is no
liability for the felons ([*People v Kern*, 75 N.Y.2d 638,
658,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8067110572255514496&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)

\[Mo\]). Where a victim, a police officer or other third party shoots
and kills, the prosecution faces a significant obstacle in proving
beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury that the felons should be held
responsible for causing the death.

Second, the New York felony murder statute spells out the affirmative
defense available to the accomplice who does not cause the death (*see*,
Penal Law § 125.25 \[3\] \[a\]-\[d\]). Defendants assert that our
construction of the statute\'s causality language will mean that an
accomplice whose partner is the shooter will have a defense but one
whose unarmed partner causes the death will not. The plain language of
the statute does not support that proposition. The statutory defense is
available to the accomplice who (a) does not cause the death, (b) is
unarmed, (c) has no reason to believe that the cofelon is armed and (d)
has no reason to believe that the cofelon will \"engage in conduct
likely to result in death or serious physical injury\". Thus, by its
terms, the defense is not limited to situations where the cofelon kills
with a weapon; it applies as well to instances where some other
\"conduct likely to result in death\" is not within the contemplation of
the accomplice.

In short, our established common-law rules governing determinations of
causality and the availability of the statutory defense provide adequate
boundaries to felony murder liability. The language of Penal Law §
125.25 (3) evinces the Legislature\'s desire to extend liability broadly
to those who commit serious crimes in ways that endanger the lives of
others. That other States choose more narrow approaches is of no moment
to our statutory scheme. Our Legislature has chosen not to write those
limitations into our law, and we are bound by that legislative
determination.

Finally, we conclude that there was no error in the court\'s
instructions on defendant Santana\'s culpability. The jury was properly
charged that more than \"but for\" causation was required; that it must
find the fatal result was the sufficiently direct and foreseeable result
of Hernandez\'s acts *(see*, [*People v Kibbe*, 35 N.Y.2d 407,
413,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2146421203254499521&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra)*.

[319\*319](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=3094702040122584711&scilh=0#p319)The
evidence established that Hernandez, when confronted by the officers in
the courtyard, refused to surrender and continued to move toward one
officer with his gun drawn. Immediate flight and attempts to thwart
apprehension are patently within the furtherance of the cofelons\'
criminal objective ([*People v Gladman*, 41 N.Y.2d 123,
129](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2131794191288107956&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*People v Donovan*, 53 AD2d
27](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10750208421369256740&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
Moreover, it was highly foreseeable that when Hernandez continued toward
the officer with his gun drawn that shots would be fired and someone
might be hit. Foreseeability does not mean that the result must be the
most likely event. Undoubtedly, in planning the robbery, defendants did
not anticipate that their victim would be a State Trooper or that a
back-up unit would be on the scene. Yet, it was foreseeable that police
would try to thwart crime ([*People v Irby*, 47 N.Y.2d
894](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975284873144233712&q=82+N.Y.2d+309+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)),
and Hernandez was aware that police were on the scene at the point he
resisted arrest and remained armed. As the Appellate Division concluded,
it is simply implausible for defendants to claim that defendants could
not have foreseen a bullet going astray when Hernandez provoked a gun
battle outside a residential building in an urban area.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

Order affirmed.

In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine

 

**David Crump & Susan Waite Crump---In Defense of the Felony Murder
Doctrine**

8 Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy 359 (1985), 361--63, 367--72,
374--76.

I. The Policies Supporting the Felony Murder Rule

*A. Rational Classification and Proportional Grading of Offenses: Actus
Reus as an Element of Just Desert*

Classical theory divides the elements of crimes into two categories:
mens rea and actus reus. Mens rea, or "guilty mind," is the mental state
or states required to complete the offense. Actus reus may be translated
literally as "the wrongful act," but it is better understood as
referring to all of the physical elements of the crime, including the
defendant's actions, the surrounding circumstances, and the
consequences.

Differences in result must be taken into account as part of actus reus
if classification and grading are to be rational. For example, murder
and attempted murder may require similar mental states \* \* \* but no
common law jurisdiction treats the two offenses as one, and certainly
none treats attempted murder more severely. The only difference
justifying this classification is that death results in one offense but
not in the other. Similarly, it is a misdemeanor for a person to operate
a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, but if this conduct
causes the death of a human being, the offense in some jurisdictions is
elevated to the status of homicide. \* \* \*

These classifications are the result of a concern for grading offenses
so as to reflect societal notions of proportionality. \* \* \*

The felony murder doctrine serves this goal, just as do the distinctions
inherent in the separate offenses of attempted murder and murder, or
impaired driving and vehicular homicide. Felony murder reflects a
societal judgment that an intentionally committed robbery that causes
the death of a human being is qualitatively more serious than an
identical robbery that does not. \...\[T\]he felony murder doctrine
reflects the conclusion that a robbery that causes death is more closely
akin to murder than to robbery. If this conclusion accurately reflects
societal attitudes, and if classification of crimes is to be influenced
by such attitudes in order to avoid depreciation of the seriousness of
the offense and to encourage respect for the law, then the felony murder
doctrine is an appropriate classificatory device.

There is impressive empirical evidence that this classification does
indeed reflect widely shared societal attitudes. \* \* \*

*B.  Condemnation: Reaffirming the Sanctity of Human Life*

A purpose of sentencing closely related to proportionality is that of
condemnation. \* \* \* \[T\]he purpose of condemnation or of expressing
societal outrage deserves separate mention as a policy concern
underlying the felony murder rule.

Condemnation itself is a multifaceted idea. It embodies the notion of
reinforcement of societal norms and values as a guide to the conduct of
upright persons, as opposed to less upright ones who presumably require
the separate prod of "deterrence." The felony murder rule serves this
purpose by distinguishing crimes that cause human deaths, thus
reinforcing the reverence for human life. \* \* \* Another aspect of
condemnation is the expression of solidarity with the victims of crime.
If we as a society label a violent offense in a manner that depreciates
its significance, we communicate to the victim by implication that we do
not understand his suffering. \* \* \* Felony murder is a useful
doctrine because it reaffirms to the surviving family of a
felony-homicide victim the kinship the society as a whole feels with him
by denouncing in the strongest language of the law the intentional crime
that produced the death.

 \* \* \*

*C.  Deterrence*

Deterrence is often cited as one justification for the felony murder
doctrine. \* \* \* Deterrence is the policy most often recognized in the
cases. 

Scholars, however, tend to dismiss this rationale, using such arguments
as the improbability that felons will know the law, the unlikelihood
that a criminal who has formed the intent to commit a felony will
refrain from acts likely to cause death, or the assertedly small number
of felony-homicides.

The trouble with these criticisms is that they underestimate the
complexity of deterrence. There may be more than a grain of truth in the
proposition that felons, if considered as a class, evaluate risks and
benefits differently than members of other classes in society. The
conclusion does not follow, however, that felons cannot be deterred, or
that criminals are so different from other citizens that they are
impervious to inducements or deterrents that would affect people in
general. \* \* \* The felony murder rule is just the sort of simple,
commonsense, readily enforceable, and widely known principle that is
likely to result in deterrence.

At the same time, the argument that felons may be ignorant of the law is
unduly categorical. \* \* \* \[T\]he general population, including
felons, is probably more aware of the outlines of the felony murder
doctrine than of many other, more common criminal concepts, if only
because of the influence of television. \* \* \*

The argument against deterrence often proceeds on the additional
assumption that felony murder is addressed only to accidental killings
and cannot result in their deterrence. \* \* \* The proposition that
accidental killings cannot be deterred is inconsistent with the
widespread belief that the penalizing of negligence, and even the
imposition of strict liability, may have deterrent consequences.

*D. Clear and Unambiguous Definition of Offenses and Sentence
Consequences*

Clear definition of crimes is advantageous. Imprecision in homicide
definition is particularly prevalent and troublesome. \* \* \* If
properly defined and applied, the felony murder doctrine sometimes
provides the advantage of greater clarity. The mental state of intention
to commit robbery, rape, or kidnapping is less ambiguous than the terms
generally governing homicidal mental states. \* \* \*

*E. Optimal Allocation of Criminal Justice Resources*

Another advantage of the felony murder rule \* \* \* is that it may aid
in the optimal allocation of criminal justice resources. \* \* \* The
efforts of judges, courtroom time, lawyering on both sides, and support
services are all scarce resources. Although we resist thinking of
criminal justice in these terms, and few would be willing to put a
specific dollar price upon its proper function, the quality of our
justice is limited by the scarcity of these resources and by the
efficiency with which we allocate them. \* \* \*

*F.  Minimization of the Utility of Perjury*

Many crimes are defined more broadly than their harmful consequences
alone might justify. For example, there are prohibitions upon the
possession of heroin or the carrying of certain kinds of weapons, even
though these actions, without use of the contraband, are not
intrinsically harmful. A person might attempt to defend his possession
of heroin by stating that he did not intend to use or distribute it (for
example, he might explain that he collects controlled substances as
others collect coins or stamps). This explanation, even if true, would
be regarded as irrelevant under most statutes.

Such a result may be justified by the concern that any other approach
would unduly reward perjury. \* \* \* A similar rationale may underlie
the felony murder rule; thus \* \* \* the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
justified its application of the felony murder rule to the circumstances
before it with the observation, "It is rare \* \* \* that a criminal
telephones or telegraphs his criminal intent. \* \* \*The law itself is
brought into disrepute when it is defined so that perjury is frequent.
Jurors might be induced to lose respect for the criminal justice system
even as they acquit the defendant on his ambiguous claim of accident,
which they disbelieve but cannot reject beyond a reasonable doubt.

Sentenced to Life for an Accident Miles Away

 

The New Yorker, December 11, 2023

 

A Reporter at Large\
Sentenced to Life for an Accident Miles Away: \
A draconian legal doctrine called felony murder has put thousands of
Americans--- disproportionately young and Black---in prison.\
By Sarah Stillman\
December 11, 2023

In 1982, when Ian Marcus was nine days old, his father left work and
headed home to his family on Long Island on a new moped, only to be
killed by a driver who'd run a red light. "Here I was, this
twenty-five-year-old widow with a baby," Ian's mother, Donna, told me.
About a year and a half after the accident, when a bearded guy who ran a
Brooklyn meat locker asked her out, "it took ten friends to convince me
to go." Her date, Dean Amelkin, arrived with a plastic train set for
Ian. Before long, her son had a second dad, a second last name, and two
younger sisters.

The family relocated to South Florida, where Dean helped his own father
run a graphics shop. Eager for Ian and his sisters to achieve more
economic stability than he'd known, Dean pushed them academically,
weeping with pride when Ian won a national debating championship in high
school. Eventually, Ian went on to law school, landing a job at an élite
Manhattan law firm; as a kid, he had watched "My Cousin Vinny" with his
dad, and they'd agreed that lawyering looked fun.

One Sunday morning in August, 2012, Ian, now thirty, was in bed in
Brooklyn when his mother called, distraught. Every Sunday for more than
a decade, Dean had met some buddies at a shopping center, biked thirty
miles to a beach and back, and then lingered over breakfast. But on that
morning Dean hadn't made it home. For the second time in his life, Ian
had lost his father to a reckless driver.

This shock was swiftly followed by another. As a result of the crash,
which all parties agreed was unintentional, two men stood accused of
murdering his father and a friend who was cycling with him. One of those
charged, twenty-five-year-old Sadik Baxter, had never laid eyes on the
victims. At the moment of impact, he had been miles away, in handcuffs.

When Donna heard the charges, she asked, How is this even possible? Ian
had learned the answer in law school: a sweeping and uniquely American
legal doctrine, often couched in terms of justice for victims' families,
called felony murder. To engage in certain unlawful activities, the
theory goes, is to assume full responsibility if a death
occurs---regardless of intent.

The precipitating offenses in this case: Sadik Baxter had searched five
cars for stray cash before surrendering when cops appeared, and O'Brian
Oakley, his twenty-six-year-old friend, had fled the scene, lost control
of his car in a police chase, and killed the bicyclists. The prosecution
charged both men with two counts of felony murder in the first degree.

Recently, Ian spoke with me about the case while caring for his newborn
daughter in Brooklyn; as we talked, he sometimes ran his hand down a
thick beard he'd grown in homage to his dad. "It's truly one of the
cruellest ideas in the American legal system," he said of felony murder.
"And most people don't even know it exists."

When Sadik Baxter was nine years old, he felt he'd discovered God after
tasting the fruits of his parents' birthplace, Jamaica. He devoured the
soursop, the star fruit, and the jackfruit; his father, a former cop in
Kingston, took note. Sadik's mother, who'd been raising him just outside
Miami, soon asked her ex to keep their son on the island for a spell and
instill in him some discipline and focus. One way to do that, the father
decided, would be to teach him to nurture plants and fruit trees of his
own---a project to which Sadik became devoted.

A month before Sadik was arrested for killing the men he'd never seen,
his father phoned him to relay a disturbing dream. "Something very bad
is going to happen," he warned, but this catastrophe might be prevented
if Sadik returned to his love of horticulture. At the time, Sadik felt
that something very bad had already happened---a string of bad things,
in fact. In a 2009 Miami night-club shooting, he'd taken a stray bullet
in his tailbone, and the long recovery had cost him his job at the
reception desk of a hotel. "Can you believe I'm changing your Pampers
again?" his mom teased as she took care of him. Just as his gunshot
injury began to heal, she had a stroke, then died at the age of
fifty-nine. In his grief and physical distress, Sadik became addicted to
painkillers.

His father, on the phone, put forward another way to live: Couldn't he
import Jamaican plants and sell them in Florida grocery stores for a
hefty markup? Think Scotch-bonnet peppers! And doesn't everyone love a
poinsettia at Christmas? His son could do something he liked and make a
living.

"Good idea," Sadik replied, before returning to doing precious little.
One Saturday night soon afterward, he and O'Brian Oakley played
blackjack and downed free drinks at a suburban Miami casino. Long after
midnight, having lost a lot of money and popped a Percocet, Sadik left
the casino with O'Brian and ended up in Cooper City, a nearby community
of back-yard pools and luxe landscaping. It occurred to Sadik, cruising
the winding streets, that he could steal from cars to offset his losses.
O'Brian, a singer-songwriter, told me that he resisted the proposal at
first. But just before dawn he found himself sitting in his parked
silver sedan on a corner, as Sadik got out and looked around.

Sadik was hardly inconspicuous; at six feet nine, he was so lanky that
his mom had called him Coconut Tree. Still, he had the benefit of the
dark. Like a kid up too early on Christmas morning, he discovered a drum
set in one unlocked car and an embroidered bag of baseball equipment in
another. Then he turned his attention to a black S.U.V. sitting outside
a home edged with palm trees. Inside the car, he grabbed a handful of
change and a pair of sunglasses, only to look up and see a man striding
toward him across the grass.

Bradley Kantor, a health-care entrepreneur, and his wife had just
returned from taking their son to the airport when they spotted a
stranger in their driveway. Sadik tried to saunter calmly away, but
Kantor ran back to his car and began driving slowly behind him, his wife
filming on her phone as he called 911. The first of several Broward
County Sheriff's Office vehicles pulled up in two minutes.

"Get on the ground!" a deputy ordered. Sadik was handcuffed on the grass
while having a panic attack---not least because he was supposed to pick
up his four-year-old daughter, Danasia, that morning.

Moments later, O'Brian drove past. He had fled the scene when Kantor
arrived, but had gotten lost exiting the neighborhood and accidentally
circled back around. "That's the car!" Kantor cried out. O'Brian hit the
accelerator, and multiple officers gave chase. They trailed him at high
speed through a residential neighborhood. Eighteen minutes later,
O'Brian ran a light and was struck by another vehicle; his car crashed
into Dean Amelkin and his friend Christopher McConnell.

Sadik learned of the accident shortly before he arrived at the sheriff's
office, where he confessed to stealing from five unlocked cars. Wearing
a blue hospital gown, his voice thick from medications he'd been
administered after his panic attack, he asked a detective what would
happen next. He'd be charged with burglary, the detective replied. Three
weeks later, Sadik received a written copy of his indictment at a
Broward County jail.

According to a grand jury, both he and O'Brian did "unlawfully and
feloniously kill and murder" two people. The prosecution had decided not
to pursue the death penalty, but the first-degree- murder charges were
punishable by life in prison without parole. Later, Sadik told me,
"That's when I went crazy."

What makes a murderer? Intent is often assumed to be a factor. But, for
hundreds of years, the felony-murder doctrine has muddled this conceit.

In 1716, the legal theorist William Hawkins argued that a crime like
robbery "necessarily tends to raise Tumults and Quarrels . . . and
cannot but be attended with the Danger of personal Hurt." Any resulting
death, he posited, was tantamount to murder. Such notions began being
applied in British courts later in the eighteenth century, and, almost
from the beginning, Britons were questioning whether the felony-murder
doctrine was just.

The question came to a head in 1953, when, despite widespread pleas for
clemency, a nineteen-year-old Londoner named Derek Bentley was executed
because his sixteen-year-old accomplice in a burglary killed a policeman
during the crime. Four years later, the U.K. abolished the doctrine, and
other Commonwealth nations followed suit. The United States, meanwhile,
went in the opposite direction.

According to Guyora Binder, of the University at Buffalo School of Law,
the modern felony- murder doctrine is best understood as "a distinctly
American innovation." Although it was first applied early in the
nineteenth century, use of the charge surged in the nineteen-seventies,
when the era of mass incarceration began. Fifty years later, Binder
contends, no country relies on the doctrine more.

Baxter's daughter, Danasia, was four years old when he was arrested.

In Tulsa, two men attempted to steal some copper wire from a radio tower
and accidentally electrocuted themselves. One of them died and the other
was charged with first-degree murder while recovering from his burns in
the hospital; the girlfriend of the deceased was also charged with
murder, for having driven them to the tower. In Topeka, a
twenty-two-year-old made the mistake of hiding his gun atop his
girlfriend's refrigerator; he was charged with first- degree murder
several days later, when a child inadvertently fired it at a
thirteen-year-old girl. In Minneapolis, a sixteen-year-old girl who sat
in the car while two older men killed someone in a robbery was charged
with felony murder. Deemed too young to enter the adult prison
population after her conviction, she was placed in solitary confinement
for months, purportedly for her own safety. In Somerville, Tennessee,
last May, three teen-age girls overdosed on fentanyl in their high
school's parking lot before a graduation ceremony. Two of them died, and
the surviving girl was charged with murder.

For prosecutors, the felony-murder rule offers an efficient path to
conviction: winning a case is much easier if you don't need to prove a
person's mens rea---"guilty mind"---or even, in some cases, to establish
that the accused was at the scene of the crime. Forty-eight states now
have some version of the statute. Charlie Smith, the president of the
National District Attorneys Association, told me that the tool is
particularly useful in cases with vulnerable victims, such as an elderly
woman in a wheelchair who gets assaulted in a purse-snatching incident
and dies. "The community would feel it's not reasonable if the old
lady's death was just a simple misdemeanor assault," he said.
Prosecutors often employ felony murder when a death results from an
armed robbery---a category of crime that Smith contends, in the spirit
of Hawkins, carries death as a foreseeable outcome.

Another benefit to prosecutors is that the steep penalties often
attached to felony murder--- including life sentences---compel
defendants to plead guilty to a lesser charge. "We shouldn't
underestimate how many plea bargains occur in the shadow of
felony-murder charges across the country," Ekow Yankah, a law professor
at the University of Michigan, told me. "It is one of those quiet
drivers of mass incarceration we never acknowledge."

Remarkably, no one knows how many people in the United States have been
imprisoned for the crime. So in 2022, working with students and
colleagues at the Yale Investigative Reporting Lab, I decided to try to
get a sense of the scale. We started by filing public-records requests
to state corrections departments and other agencies across the country;
to our surprise, most told us that they weren't keeping track. "The
records do not exist," an official at the Virginia Department of
Corrections wrote, in a typical response. In most states, a
felony-murder conviction gets lumped in with other types of murder,
clouding the data. It was as if the extent of felony murder in America
were hidden by design.

When we eventually secured robust data from eleven states, our lab's
analysts discovered that racial disparities for felony-murder
convictions were higher---sometimes far higher---than the already
disproportionate rates of Black incarceration over all. In Wisconsin,
where Black individuals account for less than seven per cent of the
population, the data show that they make up seventy-six per cent of
those incarcerated for felony murder. In St. Louis, every felony- murder
conviction between 2010 and 2022---a total of forty-seven people,
according to the State of Missouri---was of a Black person.

To identify cases in other states, we worked with analysts at the
nonprofit organization Measures for Justice, and with several law-school
clinics, to obtain previously unpublished data. Thus far, we've
documented more than ten thousand felony-murder convictions nationwide.
We've also scoured trial records, appeals, and news clips, finding and
scrutinizing more than two hundred cases, like Baxter's, in which the
defendant neither killed nor intended to kill the victim. Women were
sometimes charged for driving getaway cars for abusive partners, or
performing other tasks under duress; some of the women served longer
jail terms than their partners who'd committed the killing. And, time
and again, young people were prosecuted for what an acquaintance, to
their shock, had decided to do. In the past two years, I travelled from
Alabama to California to Michigan to meet some of the individuals who
have served time on the charge---along with crime victims' families,
prosecutors, public defenders, and others---to consider how a doctrine
so widely critiqued, and rejected elsewhere in the world, has proved
stubbornly resilient in the United States.

In the days after his arrest, Sadik Baxter figured he'd be released on
bail in time for his daughter's first day of kindergarten. He'd already
bought Danasia's uniform, a blue skirt and a bright-white shirt. But,
shortly after he learned that he was facing life in prison, a nurse in
the jail's mental-health infirmary was wrapping him in a "turtle suit,"
a heavy anti-suicide smock, and a doctor was prescribing a cocktail of
drugs.

Once off suicide watch, Sadik remained in a spiritual hole. "I slept
through breakfast, lunch, and dinner," he told me. The depression lasted
for most of his first year in jail, as he awaited trial. He had
originally been appointed a lawyer who struck him as attentive and
hardworking, but that attorney was soon replaced by another. The new
guy, Sadik thought, treated him like a nuisance. To soothe his panic, he
took to playing spades or dominoes with other men in the infirmary's
dayroom. One afternoon, an older man named Erik came in and asked for a
word.

"Look, I can tell you're fighting time, because I see you've got
stripes," Erik said. Indeed, in the jail, inmates' color-coded outfits
told a story, indicating the severity of charges. Men in black and white
stripes---including Erik---were staring down violent charges that could
carry a sentence of life. Sadik explained to Erik that he was facing
first-degree felony-murder charges for killing two people he'd never
encountered. "So why are you sitting around playing spades," Erik asked,
"when you need to focus on learning the law?"

Erik, a Detroit native, sat down with Sadik in his six-man cell and
pulled a manila envelope from beneath his bed. "Read this," he said,
handing over a few pages of a lawsuit he had filed. Sadik had never
completed high school but considered himself a good reader---he'd
finished a dozen James Patterson novels in jail. He found the language
of Erik's complaint baffling, though. The older man assured him that
he'd learn.

The jail had a law library, and Erik taught Sadik how to file a request
form that would grant him copies of a few cases at a time, precedents
that might prove relevant to his defense. Early each morning, he'd head
to Erik's cell to read and annotate the cases, turning one of the cots
into his desk. Some of his spades partners from the dayroom eventually
joined him. "I'm all about freeing myself," Erik told them, "and you
should be, too."

The cell became a classroom, with Uncle E., as the men called their new
professor, using one wall as a chalkboard. Sadik told me that, in
addition to lessons on case research, "Erik taught us how to file a
lawsuit, how to write a grievance, and how to assert our constitutional
rights."

Over the next two months, as Sadik burned through case files on felony
murder, a thirty-year- old opinion caught his attention. In State v.
Amaro, several men arranged to sell more than thirteen thousand dollars'
worth of marijuana to a buyer, who, it turned out, was an undercover
cop. When other cops descended on the group, just after the deal, to
make arrests, Juan Amaro tried to escape by climbing a fence; a
detective grabbed him, pulled him to the ground, and hit him. Moments
later, one of his accomplices shot and killed an officer. Could Amaro,
who had been apprehended and struck just moments before the officer was
murdered, be prosecuted for the killing? "When I read the case, my heart
beat so fast," Sadik told me.

On the fifth page of the opinion, the judge said that being arrested
didn't relieve others of liability for the murder. But, in a footnote,
he qualified that his decision "might have been different" had a
defendant been "securely in custody, either in a jail cell, in a squad
car, or perhaps even in handcuffs." The judge went on, "This is not the
situation here, and, thus, is left for another day."

Sadik was ecstatic. He had been, indisputably, in handcuffs when the
deaths occurred. The judge's phrase became a mantra of sorts, one he
often repeated in his cell when he felt hopeless: "Left for another
day!"

In the spring of 2014, as Sadik's double-murder trial approached, he and
his attorney discussed the possibility of a plea deal. Should Sadik
agree to testify against O'Brian Oakley, his felony- murder charges
might be dropped, leaving only the thefts from five cars. Each of those
thefts carried a five-year maximum sentence, and his attorney hinted
that he might be able to negotiate that potential twenty-five-year term
down to less than five years.

One of Sadik's cousins, Brian Kirlew, had been a public defender in a
nearby county, and wrote to urge him to take a deal: "I have tried 7
murder cases and nearly 50 jury trials. I am as experienced and
competent as a trial lawyer gets. So listen to me carefully: You need to
take a plea deal, if you want to get out of prison alive."

Sadik didn't want to snitch on a friend, though. And, while he would
readily acknowledge the burglaries, he felt that he was innocent of
murder, and couldn't imagine that a jury of his peers would disagree.
Even the judge, Jeffrey Levenson, had said at a pretrial hearing, "I
think you have a very defensible case, in terms of whether you're
responsible for the homicide." So in May, 2014, Sadik shuffled into a
Broward County courthouse in waist chains, changed into the black suit
that he'd worn to his mother's funeral, and girded himself for a trial.

Before swearing in the jury, the judge offered Sadik a final chance to
take a plea, and underlined the risk. "Jury instructions in this are
pretty tough for a defendant," he explained, and if Sadik were to be
convicted he'd be forced to sentence him, under mandatory sentencing
rules, to life in prison.

Florida---where our investigation discovered nearly a thousand people
serving life or life without parole for felony murder---is one of more
than twenty states in which the law routinely strips judges of their
discretion in sentencing those convicted on the charge. In many cases, a
judge's only option is mandatory life.

Sadik's lawyer and the prosecutor scrambled unsuccessfully to settle on
a plea deal, and Sadik duly took his seat at the front of the courtroom,
his brother and sister filing in behind him. Friends and relatives of
the victims had filed in, too, and, in a trial that lasted just two
days, several witnesses took the stand to recall the last moments in the
lives of Christopher McConnell and Dean Amelkin.

James Bolger had biked with the two men every Sunday morning for years.
On that final morning, Bolger told the courtroom, he'd been approaching
a green light, trying to catch up with McConnell and Amelkin, who were
riding ahead of him. Suddenly, Bolger testified, "there was a silver
blur of a car going through, and they were gone." Bolger, a trained
paramedic, raced over. "And what did you see?" the prosecutor asked.
"There wasn't anything to be done," Bolger replied. The men's severed
limbs were strewn in multiple directions.

Although the testimony was devastating to McConnell's wife, Denise, she
told me that, at the time, she had found comfort in the felony-murder
doctrine, sensing its moral solidity. She had married her husband when
she was twenty-one, and he'd been her stabilizing force. They'd raised a
family and run an air-conditioning company together, and his death, she
said, had put her "through hell." Listening to the evidence, she had
concluded that the defendant had decided to steal and dragged his friend
into it, so why shouldn't he be held accountable for the ramifications?
No one mentioned that, if convicted, Sadik Baxter would get life in
prison---a prospect that later disturbed her.

After the prosecutor called more than a dozen witnesses, including
Bradley Kantor, the man from whom Sadik had stolen the sunglasses and
loose change, Sadik's attorney called just one: Sadik himself, who was
nervous and struggled to speak clearly. He confessed to the thefts,
hoping that the jury would value his willingness to take responsibility.
When Sadik finished and returned to his seat, O'Brian Oakley's attorney
shook his head and said, "You dumbshit! You just convicted yourself." It
took the jury thirty-seven minutes to reach a verdict. On both counts,
Sadik was guilty of first-degree murder.

Ian Marcus Amelkin, back in Brooklyn, was shocked to get a call from the
state's attorney's office telling him the trial was over less than
forty-eight hours after it had begun. Hanging up, he felt his grief
compounding. He'd spent two years consumed by postmortem logistics---
reminding his mom to eat, settling Dean's debts---while also wrecked by
his own memories: Dean's "Wayne's World" impressions; his turning the
volume up high for everything Jimi Hendrix, whom he'd seen in concert on
New Year's Day in 1969; his lessons, as a meat man, on how to grill the
perfect steak. And now Dean's death was being used by the state to
separate someone else's father from his child.

"Another life is ruined," Ian wrote flatly to his family in an e-mail.
He'd recently forsaken corporate law to become a public defender ("Would
you really leave all that money on the table?" his dad had wondered
shortly before he died), and the brevity of Sadik Baxter's trial made
him wonder if a real defense had even been mounted. He called his
sisters, Brett and Chelsey, to ask what, at this point, the three of
them might do.

Ian had attended New York University School of Law, where he joined a
clinic run by the Alabama civil-rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson. ("That
was back when he was legal-nerd famous, not Oprah famous," Ian said.) At
the time, Stevenson was preparing to litigate a groundbreaking
felony-murder case before the Supreme Court: that of a fourteen-year-old
who had been sentenced to life in prison for a killing done by one of
his companions. That case contributed to the Court's declaring that
mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles were
unconstitutional. Ian was assigned to work with one of Stevenson's
death-row clients, a case that immersed him in his professor's
contention that "each person is more than the worst thing they've ever
done."

From the beginning, Ian had tried to apply that same perspective to
Sadik Baxter and O'Brian Oakley, and when he and his sisters learned
that the two men would be charged with double murder in the first
degree, they also sensed, as Brett put it, that "Dad would think it's
bullshit." Knowing that the State of Florida gives special weight to
crime victims' perspectives, Ian decided to try to persuade the
prosecutor to dismiss the murder charges. "I didn't go in with an
abolitionist perspective," he recalled. "A reasonable sentence would
have been fine with us"--- say, a maximum of ten years for Oakley and a
few years for Baxter.

In a phone call with the prosecutor, the champion debater tried to be
chummy and measured as he suggested that, after an accident, locking up
two young fathers (Oakley had a daughter, too) for lengthy terms wasn't
his family's idea of justice. His arguments failed to land, and, Ian
told me, the prosecutor later called to float the idea of Oakley's
pleading to forty years. "Very, very harsh," Ian exclaimed, growing
frustrated. Afterward, he swung between anger at a prosecutor who seemed
to want him to be "out for blood" and guilt that he'd let Baxter and
Oakley down.

With Baxter's verdict now in, Chelsey contacted his lawyer to ask if she
and her siblings might help at sentencing. The attorney was stunned---it
was the first time that a family of a crime victim had reached out in
this way to help one of his clients. Although Baxter's sentence was
pretty much a foregone conclusion, the lawyer thought the fact that
Dean's kids were asking for restraint couldn't hurt. It might even help
someday, the Amelkins figured, should Baxter appeal.

In early June, 2014, when Sadik returned to court to be sentenced, his
lawyer approached the bench, holding aloft the Amelkin siblings' plea
for mercy. It argued that Sadik had been in handcuffs when the chase
began and that a life sentence without parole would be "cruel and
unusual punishment" and leave them "heartsick." After acknowledging the
missive and calling Sadik forward to read a letter of apology, Judge
Levenson decreed the inevitable: life without parole. "The law in
itself, good, bad, or indifferent, is enacted by the legislature,"
Levenson said, concluding, "Good luck to you, Mr. Baxter."

The man who killed Donna Amelkin's first husband got nine months. The
man whose friend killed her second husband got life without parole. As
"nuts" as the discrepancy seemed to her, she told me, she hadn't lost
much sleep over it. (Either way, she said, "I'm still the one who's left
alone.") She had been more preoccupied by a different injustice: that
the felony-murder rule was being used to obscure the role that the
Broward County Sheriff's Office had played in Dean's death.

Donna ran a high-school English department, and while sitting shivah
she'd received a letter from the husband of a former co-worker. A former
law-enforcement official in South Florida, he'd enclosed a copy of the
county sheriff's policy on high-speed chases, with key phrases
highlighted. Deputies were barred from starting hot pursuits if the
suspects weren't immediately endangering other people's lives or engaged
in a "forcible felony," such as a rape, a murder, or a home invasion.
Such policies exist for a reason: high-speed law-enforcement chases are
often lethal, causing roughly one death per day in the U.S., according
to a 2017 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Amelkins began
asking why Baxter's thefts had necessitated such a chase, upon which the
sheriff denied that a chase had even occurred. In 2014, the family filed
a wrongful-death claim against the sheriff's office and reached a
settlement that came with no admission of fault.

Felony murder "made it easier for the sheriff's department not to take
responsibility," Donna told me. Once Baxter and Oakley were charged with
murder, she said, "the question of how the deaths happened got pushed
aside."

In our reporting lab, we identified more than thirty instances of
high-speed law-enforcement chases that resulted in fatalities and were
followed by a felony-murder charge. In some of these cases, police had
violated their own pursuit policies.

Another subset of felony-murder cases we examined involved shootings by
people in law enforcement. In many states, when an officer fires a
lethal gunshot at a crime scene, individuals who were with the victim
may be charged with the killing. (The rationale is that, without the
instigating felony, police wouldn't have been on the scene in the first
place.) We compiled twenty cases in which an officer pulled the trigger
and someone else assumed the charge; the best known of these cases is
that of LaKeith Smith.

In 2015, when he was fifteen, LaKeith and four friends broke into two
unoccupied homes in Millbrook, Alabama, to steal Xbox games and other
electronics. A neighbor called the police, who appeared, guns drawn.
LaKeith ran into the woods, and one of the officers shot and killed his
friend, sixteen-year-old A'Donte Washington, who they said had a gun.
The prosecution alleged that one of the older teen-agers had fired a
shot, and a grand jury found that the officer's use of force was
"justified." LaKeith was charged as an adult with murder, for the
killing at the officer's hand.

Reviewing our felony-murder data, which included more than a thousand
cases involving teens like LaKeith, my lab colleagues and I were struck
by a contradiction. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that adolescence
is marked by "a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of
responsibility," which make juveniles "less deserving of the most severe
punishments." But when it comes to felony murder, we discovered, being
younger was not a mitigating variable. The average age of individuals
convicted of felony murder appeared to be lower than for standard
murder---in many states, more than four years lower.

In prison, Baxter developed a mastery of felony-murder jurisprudence
which surpassed that of many professional defense attorneys.Photograph
courtesy the author Jenny Egan, the chief attorney for the juvenile
division of the public defender's office in Baltimore, told me, "Because
of peer pressure, young people tend to commit crimes in groups," and,
when a death results, "all of the kids involved get charged with murder,
and it gets used as a cudgel to get kids to coöperate against each
other." Nazgol Ghandnoosh, the co-director of research at the Sentencing
Project, notes that youth of color are particularly likely to be
"punished for presence."

LaKeith watched as, one by one, his friends took pleas that ranged from
seventeen to twenty- eight years. But LaKeith and his family, some of
whom knew firsthand how violent the state's prison system could be,
decided to take his case to trial. In 2018, LaKeith, who is Black, was
sentenced before an all-white jury to sixty-five years in prison, later
reduced to fifty-five years. "There's no sugar-coating it," LaKeith's
mother, BronTina Smith, told me. "He was punished for bucking the system
and trying to exercise his right to a trial."

BronTina has since become a prominent voice in a movement to challenge
the felony-murder rule---a movement led for many years by families of
incarcerated people and lately galvanized by Black Lives Matter.
BronTina works with a coalition spearheaded by Represent Justice, a
nonprofit organization, and together they persuaded celebrities from
Erykah Badu to Kim Kardashian to direct attention to LaKeith's case. One
of the coalition's goals is to lobby for state reforms that would limit
how the felony-murder charge can be used against defendants who didn't
actually kill, including those held responsible for shootings by law
enforcement.

Marshan Allen, a Represent Justice staffer who canvassed Millbrook
residents on the issue at bars and tailgates, said, "We spoke to a lot
of very conservative people, and most of them had no idea how this law
works. But, once we explained it to them, we found that they didn't
agree with LaKeith's sentence at all. It's intuitive. People get it."

Last December, under pressure, the judge who'd originally sentenced
LaKeith to sixty-five years agreed to a resentencing hearing. "GOD IS
REAL!!!!!" his mother posted online. In court, the civil-rights lawyer
Leroy Maxwell would have a chance to make the case that LaKeith's
original public defender had neglected to present mitigating evidence.
Maxwell hoped that his client might be resentenced to time served, and
walk free.

Last March, on the night before the hearing, LaKeith's supporters held a
vigil in Montgomery. While making posters to take to court, his family
chatted about the meal they'd serve when he came home. "Greens and
chicken and mac and cheese---all the soul food," BronTina said, smiling.
"Cereal," countered LaKeith's aunt Gladys, remembering how the boy would
come to her house "and suddenly all of my Cinnamon Toast Crunch and
Frosted Flakes would be gone."

The next morning, LaKeith---now a twenty-four-year-old who'd spent a
third of his life behind bars---entered a courthouse in Wetumpka,
Alabama, in orange shower shoes and chains. His mom, in sparkly green
sneakers and a fedora, sat in the first row. Judge Sibley Reynolds
listened to a series of witnesses, including A'Donte Washington's
father, who testified that he hadn't been called at the original trial.
What he would have said, he told the judge, was that LaKeith shouldn't
serve time, because "he wasn't the one that murdered my son." Even the
D.A. appeared receptive to a lighter sentence, saying of the original
attorney, "Hell, I wouldn't hire her!"

Finally, the judge looked down at LaKeith. "I'm sentencing you to thirty
years in custody," he said. Many people in the gallery gasped. "Dirty
bigot judge!" a woman behind me shouted. "The cops killed A'Donte!" That
night, the homecoming feast that the Smiths had optimistically prepared
was used to feed a tearful group.

Because Florida is one of many states where what begins as a visible
first-degree felony-murder charge in the data gets mysteriously
truncated, after conviction, into first-degree murder, Sadik Baxter was
now, to the system, just another killer---a wary lifer who passed the
years performing prison jobs with antebellum-sounding names, like
"houseman" and "groundsman." But, on his own time, Sadik had channelled
his inner Uncle E. and evolved into a jailhouse lawyer whose mastery of
felony murder surpassed that of many professional defense attorneys.
Three filing boxes of annotated case law were among his most valued
possessions; he carted them from prison to prison over the years.

He'd come to believe that one of the most promising defenses in his case
was the "independent act" theory, which had received passing mention in
State v. Amaro. It established that a defendant wasn't responsible for
an illegal act by his "co-felon" if that act was committed after, and
apart from, the original felony. Sadik believed that O'Brian's fatal
police chase, having come after his own arrest, was an independent act.
He just needed to prove it to a judge.

On good days, he hunkered down with a copy of "The Jailhouse Lawyer's
Handbook," sixth edition, and wrote and rewrote his pro-se legal briefs,
Jamaican dancehall music blasting in his earphones. On days when the
fight seemed hopeless, he turned to "Conversations with Myself," by
Nelson Mandela. "At least, if for nothing else," Mandela had written in
a letter from Robben Island, "the cell gives you the opportunity to look
daily into your entire conduct, to overcome the bad and develop whatever
is good in you." Mandela turned to meditation, dream journaling, and
letter writing. Sadik took up all three.

A particular obsession was imagining his way into the life of his
daughter, Danasia. If he couldn't join her at her basketball games, he
could at least commune with her in his manifestation journal, where he
would articulate his wishes for her future as if they had already
happened. One day, having heard that she was selling lip gloss, he'd
written, "Danasia's lip gloss company has sky rocketed in sales and is
the most popular lip gloss company in the world. It is currently net
worth 7 million dollars between the 7 stores she owns and is climbing by
the day."

Danasia was now a teen-ager. Sadik had been filing motions and appeals
since she was in the first grade. As he discovered, litigation is a
waiting game; years could pass between a petition and a ruling. He tried
arguing that he'd had ineffective representation, and that the sharing
of sixty-nine "gruesome" photographs of the victims' body parts and a
bloody crime scene had biased the jury. He tried to get his sentence
reduced, appealing to "the mercy of this court" to convert his charge to
manslaughter; in May, 2018, the court replied: "denied." In 2019, he
filed a motion for post-conviction relief ("denied"), and in 2020 a
motion for a rehearing ("denied"). In 2021, he ventured a Motion to
Correct Illegal Sentence ("denied").

Sadik also wrote to half a dozen journalists, and to more than twenty
law-school clinics and civil-rights attorneys around the country. In a
letter to then President Barack Obama, he explained that he'd faced
discrimination in court because of his race and his poverty, and
concluded, "I humbly ask you to point me in the right direction to help
me with my case." These efforts came to nothing.

Elsewhere in Florida, in another prison cell, his co-defendant, O'Brian
Oakley, was waging a similar battle. O'Brian had been convicted on even
more grounds than Sadik, including two counts of first-degree felony
murder and two counts of vehicular homicide, as well as five counts of
burglary. (The court was evidently unmoved by another of Ian Marcus
Amelkin's letters: "Now four lives---my dad's, Mr. McConnell's, Mr.
Baxter's, and Mr. Oakley's---are forever destroyed by the events of
August 5, 2012. . . .")

O'Brian appealed: How could he be guilty of four counts of murder when
only two deaths had occurred? In 2018, an appellate court agreed and
dropped his two vehicular-homicide convictions. But the mandatory
sentence---life without parole---remained.

When I spoke to O'Brian last spring, he wept throughout the
conversation. "People lost their lives, and I have to live with that,"
he told me, describing how often he replays the scene of the accident,
and his panicked decision to flee. "Every day, I wake up and realize
that I feel pain even in my dreams," he said. Before his incarceration,
lyrics and musical ideas came easily to him. "But I'll try to write a
song now and I can't finish it," he said. "I try to sing, but with the
pain I can't."

By the fall of 2021, Sadik's options for appeal in Florida were
dwindling and he realized that he had one real hope left: a federal
claim. He'd already argued that his life sentence was "repugnant to the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," because discretion in
sentencing is a paramount function of the judicial system, and the judge
in his case had been stripped of it. Now, citing the "independent act"
doctrine and State v. Amaro, he would make a key assertion---that his
life sentence was an "unreasonable application of established federal
law," reflecting the kind of "grossly disproportionate" sentencing that
is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.

Not long after Sadik filed his argument, I happened to write to him for
the first time, requesting an interview. His response to my letter came
almost immediately: "I must say this still feels surreal, as for years
I've been searching for a listening ear to hear the corruption and
injustice in my case, or even to be acknowledged as a human being."
Soon, we were talking almost daily.

One night in April, Sadik called, anxious. He believed the federal judge
would be ruling soon, and asked, "Have there been any updates in my
case?" Not having a lawyer put him at a serious disadvantage; it often
took weeks for him to receive basic updates from the court, even on
time-sensitive matters.

I logged into pacer, a federal-records database, and there it was: a
ruling from U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom. I downloaded the file,
quickly scrolled to the bottom to find the judge's decision on his
habeas petition, and read it aloud: "denied." Then I read more closely,
and said, "Hold on."

The judge had rejected the appeal on thirteen grounds. Her reasoning
turned on a little-known but extraordinarily consequential law, the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Signed by
President Bill Clinton, the law radically curtails the rights of
incarcerated people. Even if Judge Bloom agreed that Sadik was in prison
unconstitutionally, she'd have to defer to the Florida court, unless a
very narrow set of conditions could be met. The surprise in the ruling
came on the ninth page, when she took up Sadik's Eighth Amendment claim.

"The court agrees that the life sentences in this case were harsh," she
wrote. She later quoted a sentencing statement from Judge Levenson in
2014, acknowledging that the defendant had had little to do with the two
bicyclists' deaths: "Notwithstanding your involvement in the case, which
I think we all agree was not a significant involvement, I am mandated to
sentence you to life in prison." On Eighth Amendment grounds, Judge
Bloom had decided to grant Sadik's case a precious "certificate of
appealability," allowing him to present his argument to a higher court.
Over the phone, he exclaimed, "I'm not fully dead!"

Although defenders of felony murder often cite its value as a deterrent,
none of those I interviewed who had been imprisoned for the crime,
including Sadik, knew of the statute before being charged with it. In
2021, a task force commissioned by the Minnesota legislature further
explored such questions of deterrence. This inquiry was spurred largely
by two mothers, Toni Cater and Linda Martinson, whose daughters were
serving time on the charge after a man they'd met only minutes earlier
shot and killed someone.

Upon analyzing state data and reviewing empirical research, the task
force concluded that the felony-murder charge "does not deter behavior"
and "does not reduce the risk of re-offense." What's more, it
intensified inequities. A Black person in Minnesota was five times more
likely to be charged with felony murder than a white person, and a
Native American person ten times more likely. Fully a third of those
locked up for murder in the state were in for felony murder, and most of
them had no prior conviction for "an offense against a person." This
spring, the legislature decided to curtail severe sentences and limit
the future use of the felony-murder charge for defendants who did not
commit a killing. Because the reform will apply retroactively, hundreds
of people, including the daughters of Cater and Martinson, may have a
chance to win relief.

Minnesota legislators took their cues from California, where, after
groundbreaking reforms, more than six hundred people have had their
sentences reduced and, according to a study by California's Office of
the State Public Defender, taxpayers have saved as much as \$1.2 billion
in prison costs. Illinois and Colorado have also recently narrowed the
use of the felony-murder doctrine, and a bill now pending in New York
would permit the use of the felony-murder charge only if a defendant
"directly caused the death recklessly" or served as "an accomplice . . .
in the felony, and acted with the intent to cause death."

But, as some states pull back from the concept, others are expanding it.
In Arkansas, legislators have considered a bill allowing district
attorneys to charge women who obtain unauthorized abortions, and anyone
who aids them, with felony murder. (In the Dobbs decision, Justice
Samuel Alito wrote that abortion offered America its
"proto-felony-murder rule"; in the colonies, if a doctor gave a pregnant
woman a "potion" to aid in an abortion and she died, he could be charged
with murder.) In the wake of Dobbs, other states have proposed
legislation similar to the Arkansas bill. Some legislators are also
pushing felony murder's expansion into another fraught terrain:
overdoses tied to the opioid epidemic.

"These cartel bosses, who have taken advantage of the weakness of the
Biden Administration, must be held accountable for the millions of lives
they have destroyed with this horrific drug," Senator Ted Cruz said
recently, in support of a bill to make the lethal distribution of
fentanyl punishable with federal felony-murder charges. A mere two
milligrams of the synthetic opioid, which is cheaper than heroin and is
often used as a filler by underground drug producers, can be a lethal
dose. As deaths of unsuspecting users soar, red-state politicians have
rallied around this cause.

Some defenders and prosecutors argue that this hard line will lead to
more deaths, as fellow- users hesitate to dial 911 when they witness an
overdose. But proponents underline a payoff: that felony-murder
prosecutions will bring down drug kingpins and major suppliers.

When I examined more than three dozen overdose-related felony-murder
prosecutions, I didn't find kingpins. What I found instead were
defendants like Jacob Sayre, of Ozark, Missouri. Last December, when he
was seventeen, he was charged with killing a sixteen-year-old girl,
Victoria Jones, whom he'd met at church.

One night in September, 2022, Jacob, a homeschooled kid whose mom helped
run a Bible-study group, had received a Snapchat message from Victoria,
a softball whiz who was also a gifted student. ("She was headstrong in
science," her father told me.) According to the probable- cause
statement, Victoria wanted Jacob to bring her some cocaine, but his
dealer didn't have any. Jacob gave her a Percocet instead. "Only do a
quarter and then do the other quarter if you don't feel it," he
messaged. "Please be smart."

Victoria locked the door to her bedroom, on whose wall hung a periodic
table she knew by heart. Not long afterward, she messaged Jacob, "Ok, I
took it, like a 3rd, fucking cut it wrong, holy duck, I feel it." The
next morning, her dad forced open her door with a screwdriver. Victoria
was dead, and on the nightstand was a rolled-up twenty and the remains
of a small blue pill.

Shortly afterward, Jacob, who had never before been in trouble with the
law, was charged as an adult with felony murder and other offenses. "Her
loss affected the whole community, and we are one hundred per cent in
agreement with the state," Victoria's father, David Jones, told me. "We
don't believe a felony-murder charge is overreach."

When Jacob and I spoke this summer, he was on house arrest, trying to
keep calm as he awaits trial by practicing Van Halen covers on his
guitar. His mom, meanwhile, conducts ongoing imaginary conversations
with the district attorney: "So when you charge Jacob, and you put him
in prison, does that make our society any safer?"

Joshua Elbaz, of Gwinnett County, Georgia, is well positioned to
understand the urges for both retribution and mercy. When he was
twenty-one, his older brother, Brenden, died of a heroin overdose. In
2018, Joshua went to law school, imagining that he'd become a defender
and try to guide people who were battling addiction toward help, not
prison time. But in February, 2020, while he was in class, his dad
called, and called again. His younger brother, Alex, was just two months
away from earning his accounting degree when a Percocet laced with
fentanyl killed him.

This time, Joshua became obsessed with tracking down the man he called
"my brother's murderer." The attitude of the local police being, as he
put it, "Tough shit, get over it, there's no case," he investigated on
his own. Alex's Samsung watch contained copies of his text messages,
which identified a landscaper named Phillip Patterson as the person from
whom he had last bought drugs. Patterson was soon arrested in a sting.

Upon graduating from law school, Joshua joined the Gwinnett County
district attorney's office as a prosecutor. The office helped bring four
felony-murder cases against dealers, and, while he didn't formally work
on Patterson's case, he said, "I was so angry. I'd say, 'I'm going to
take that man to trial, and I hope he gets life.' " In early 2023, three
years after his younger brother's death, he was in the courtroom for
Patterson's pretrial hearing.

Like many people accused of felony murder, Patterson had taken a plea,
conceding to voluntary manslaughter and drug trafficking in exchange for
a forty-year sentence, with the possibility of parole after thirty. In
court, Patterson read a letter of apology to the Elbaz family as tears
streamed down his face. "He said, 'I really didn't know the drugs were
laced,' " Joshua remembered, "and I believed him."

Joshua was struck by something else he'd learned in court: that
Patterson had suddenly stopped attending his family's Sunday dinner,
which had later seemed like a clue that he was suffering from addiction.
"When I heard that," Joshua said, "the most human part of me thought,
That's the exact same thing that happened to Alex. He just stopped
coming to Sunday dinner."

Although he still believes that dealers who intentionally sell
fentanyl-laced pills should be liable for murder, Joshua now thinks that
murder charges against those who are struggling with addiction
themselves won't touch the root causes of the crisis. And, as much as
he'd dreamed of seeing Patterson led off in shackles, when it actually
happened, he told me, "it hit me like a train."

Sadik is now incarcerated in the Okaloosa Correctional Institution, in
the Florida Panhandle, hours from where most of his family lives. One
recent Saturday morning, I joined a line of women holding special
transparent purses they'd bought to allow them to carry money for snacks
through the prison gates. Inside, I spotted Sadik instantly. Living up
to his mom's nickname, Coconut Tree, he stood even taller than the two
palms painted on a prison wall--- part of a beach scene where loved ones
could pay to get their photo taken. "I'm nervous," he said. He hadn't
had a visitor in five years, when Danasia had last come with her mom and
his sister.

Sadik remembers every detail of that encounter: how Danasia covered her
face when she arrived; how he'd coaxed her forward by singing "Gon' Get
Better," by the Jamaican artist Vybz Kartel; how, when he'd finished,
she'd asked him to sing it again until, finally, he protested, "You sing
me a song!" For the next five hours, they'd played Life and Connect Four
at a picnic table, and when visiting hours were up they had both cried.
In the following years, his efforts to sing his way into her affections
grew less successful. "She's, like, 'Daddy, I'm fifteen now, I don't
watch "Strawberry Shortcake" anymore,' " he told me. Recently, she had
been missing his calls altogether.

He was telling me this as we sat in the stupefying heat of the prison
yard---a spot that afforded us some privacy from guards who called him
Too Tall and Sasquatch. Sadik was eating a box of fruit snacks from the
canteen which looked to me like processed plastic but reminded him of
the Jamaican fruits that had led him to God. He wanted to know what I'd
learned from other families fighting for felony-murder-law reform, and
when I left he asked me to tell him something of the natural world
outside the prison walls. That evening, I went for a swim at a nearby
beach and sent him a photo of a waning moon over the water.

Once home, I would check pacer for updates on his federal case, and one
afternoon I found a startling posting: the court would toss out his
petition if he didn't reply within fourteen days. He'd made a mundane
filing error but had yet to receive a copy of this notification himself,
and had only a matter of days left to sort it out. I called a lawyer who
I thought might help me find someone to translate the court's almost
incomprehensible instructions. He described the case to Christine Monta,
an appellate attorney at the MacArthur Justice Center, who felt stunned
when she looked it up. This was the kind of legal challenge to felony
murder, she told me, that she had longed for years to take on.

Sadik Baxter's case, she said, represented a chance to challenge the
"triple injustice" that many people incarcerated in state prisons have
experienced. First, prosecutors hit them with charges, like felony
murder, that are disproportionate to their crimes. Second, because of
mandatory sentences, defendants get "extreme, unconstitutional
sentences." And, third, because of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act, they are hindered from bringing their claims to federal
court. To prevail, they typically have to identify either a significant
and indisputable factual error made by a state court or a preëxisting
Supreme Court case that clearly backs up their argument. "Congress has
erected this very, very difficult standard, but we really think he meets
it," Monta told me. As a number of Supreme Court precedents have
established, she went on, "punishment should not be vastly
disproportionate to your culpability, and everyone agrees that
culpability for murder here is really, really strained."

With Sadik's permission, she began to craft a habeas appeal on his
behalf. She hopes to argue in federal court that his mandatory
life-without-parole sentence is unconstitutional and that his case
should be remanded back to trial court for resentencing.

Not long ago, while assembling the case, she encountered an intriguing
relic: the impassioned letter by Ian, Brett, and Chelsey Amelkin arguing
that Sadik's sentence was cruel and unusual, which had been omitted from
his official post-conviction court record. Moved by this lost document,
she sat at a desk lit by her own late father's lamp and began to type
the outlines of an argument.

Could former President Trump be prosecuted for felony murder for urging
on the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, which led to a number of
deaths? Could fossil-fuel-company executives be held liable for murder
for criminally deceiving the public about carbon emissions that killed
people? If we take the felony-murder doctrine's core premise seriously,
it's easy to imagine a radically different justice system. But, after
two years of closely reviewing cases, I can state with confidence that
the doctrine is rarely levelled against people of influence. It is used
instead to impose some of our society's harshest punishments on
low-income defendants, young people, and defendants of color.

I was reminded of this imbalance when I tried to reach out to Bradley
Kantor, who had called the police when Sadik stole the loose change and
sunglasses from his car. Searching online, I learned that two years ago
Kantor had been arrested in a federal raid. He pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit forty-two million dollars' worth of health-care
fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was sentenced to a
decade in prison, and the government seized his multimillion-dollar
home, his two Winnebagos, and his thirty-seven-foot yacht. When I shared
this news with Ian recently, we decided we were looking at a parable of
American sentencing: Sadik Baxter stole a few dollars, a drum set, some
used baseball equipment, and a pair of sunglasses and got life, while
Bradley Kantor stole millions and got ten years.

Brett and Chelsey Amelkin are now, like their brother, public defenders.
When they heard the news of Sadik's momentum in his federal case, all
three siblings felt heartened. "He deserves a shot," Ian said, "and so
does Oakley." If Sadik gets his second chance, Ian has already pictured
the scene. Before showing up at the hearing, he'll play the music Dean
loved---Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Blind Faith---and grab from his closet a
striped tie of his dad's that he thinks brings him luck in court. "It's
all fucked up," he said of the tie, grinning, as he laid it out for me.
"I tape it together when I wear it."

This fall, Sadik was placed in solitary confinement after a dispute with
a guard. In a cell whose window was covered over by aluminum, his mind
kept turning to Lolita, an orca at the Miami Seaquarium he'd loved to
visit as a child. When young, she'd been taken from her home in the
Salish Sea, north of Seattle, and spent the next fifty years penned in
the Seaquarium. Indigenous activists, many of whom knew her as Tokitae,
had recently won a multi-year battle to bring her home. But, just before
Sadik was put in solitary, she died, still in captivity.

Less morose distraction could be found in his manifestation journal.
When the broader public learned the details of his case, he wrote one
day, "it was such a shock to everyone that they changed the Law." When
he was finally released from solitary, he called Danasia, eager to tell
her how real this vision had seemed. She picked up for the first time
since May.

"I still want to take you to all the places you asked me to take you
when you were younger---the water park, Disney World, the beach," he
said. She grew quiet, and then had to go, but the conversation continued
in his head. "I want to take you to my daddy's farm and show you the
apple trees, and the jackfruit trees, and the mango trees. I'll show you
how to chop the sugarcane. And I'll show you how to take the bamboo and
use it to make a kind of slingshot, so that you can place an apple
blossom inside it, and let it fly."

Harrington & Binder on Race and Felony Murder in New York

 

Below is an excerpt from a recent academic study of felony murder
charges in New York State between 2008 and 2019:

**Racially Disparate and Disproportionate Punishment of Felony Murder:
Evidence from New York**, by Alexandra Harrington & Guyora Binder,
forthcoming in the Iowa Law Review (2024):

Who is arrested and convicted for felony murder in New York?

Our investigation found that felony murder arrests and convictions were
. . . skewed in New York, particularly for Black people: Black New
Yorkers were roughly 20 times more likely than White New Yorkers to be
arrested for, and to be convicted of, felony murder, and Hispanic New
Yorkers were arrested and convicted of felony murder at about five-six
times the rate of White people. Moreover, these racial disparities were
greater than those for other felonyconvictions and at least 3.5 times
greater than disparities for each of the predicate felonies for felony
murder. So too were the disparities greater for felony murder than for
other forms of second-degree murder. Felony murder liability was also
imposed disproportionately on young people. Almost a third of those
arrested and about a fourth of those convicted of felony murder were
teen-agers, and teens were about 3 times as likely as adults to be
convicted of felony murder. Among teens, the proportion of defendants
convicted without killing was lower than among adults---about 40%---but
still substantial.

We compared racial disparities in New York felony murder cases where
felony murder liability was imposed on the basis of killing to those
where felony murder liability was imposed on those who did not kill. As
reported below, wefound that the Black/White racial disparity in the
felony murder conviction of accomplices who did not kill---*34 to
1*---was nearly triple the Black/White racial disparity in the
conviction of individuals who actually killed. TheHispanic/White racial
disparity (12 to 1) in the felony murder conviction of accomplices who
did not kill was more thanquadruple the Hispanic/White disparity among
those convicted of killing. More than half of Black people convicted
offelony murder and more than 60% of Hispanic people convicted of felony
murder did not kill, compared to less than 30% of White people convicted
of felony murder. Put differently, only 7% of New Yorkers convicted of
felony murder without killing were White. When we looked at teens
convicted without killing, these racial disparities were similar.Only 2
of 24 teens convicted of felony murder without killing were White.
Moreover, more than a quarter of the people convicted of actually
killing had killed inadvertently, and more than half of those people
were Black and a third Hispanic. In our data, the effects of the
presumptively disproportionate punishment of accomplices for felony
murder fall almost exclusively on Black and Hispanic defendants.

. . . A recent experimental study by Ben Cohen, Justin Levinson and
Keith Hioki suggests that implicit bias may contribute to racial
disparities observed in such cases. The authors report that subjects
more readily attributed complicity in crime to Black than to White
suspects in otherwise identical scenarios. In short, they argued that
racial minorities may be particularly vulnerable guilt by association.
Such implicit bias could contribute to racial disparities in felony
murder liability for accomplices who did not kill, as well as racial
disparities for felony murder liability overall.

SCDB 1986-080

481 U.S. 279 (1987)

Decided April 22, 1987

 

\[ ... \]

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether a complex statistical study that
indicates a risk that racial considerations enter\[ ... \]into capital
sentencing determinations proves that petitioner McCleskey\'s capital
sentence is unconstitutional under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment.

## I

McCleskey, a black man, was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and
one count of murder in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, on
October 12, 1978. McCleskey\'s convictions arose out of the robbery of a
furniture store and the killing of a white police officer during the
course of the robbery. The evidence at trial indicated that McCleskey
and three accomplices planned and carried out the robbery. All four were
armed. McCleskey entered the front of the store while the other three
entered the rear. McCleskey secured the front of the store by rounding
up the customers and forcing them to lie face down on the floor. The
other three rounded up the employees in the rear and tied them up with
tape. The manager was forced at gunpoint to turn over the store
receipts, his watch, and \$6. During the course of the robbery, a police
officer, answering a silent alarm, entered the store through the front
door. As he was walking down the center aisle of the store, two shots
were fired. Both struck the officer. One hit him in the face and killed
him.

\[ ... \]

\[ ... \] The jury convicted McCleskey of
murder.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X134a6fb127eb84bd75e194a8e8cf8f6604ff047)At the
penalty
hearing,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X4df09be13b15efa8322e12cc6ef1273e1aa9532) the
jury heard arguments as to the appropriate sentence. \[ ... \]The court
followed the jury\'s recommendation and sentenced McCleskey to
death.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X78a01e8bf233ffe4e154319e2eeaf4e9e8e3508)

\[ ... \]

## II

 

McCleskey\'s first claim is that the Georgia capital punishment statute
violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xa6c9d9ed2fa0e2a698a681cba7de5652962d15a)He
argues that race has infected the administration of Georgia\'s statute
in two ways: persons who murder whites are more likely to be sentenced
to death than persons who murder blacks, and black murderers are more
likely to be sentenced to death than white
murderers.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xb3e74729abb1707f169ef276d5e39e855c6648a)As a
black defendant who killed a white victim, McCleskey claims that the
Baldus study demonstrates that he was discriminated against because of
his race and because of the race of his victim. In its broadest form,
McCleskey\'s claim of discrimination extends to every actor in the
Georgia capital sentencing process, from the prosecutor who sought the
death penalty and the jury that imposed the sentence, to the State
itself that enacted the capital punishment statute and allows it to
remain in effect despite its allegedly discriminatory application. \[
... \]

## A

 

Our analysis begins with the basic principle that a defendant who
alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving \"the
existence of purposeful discrimination.\" \[ ... \] Thus, to prevail
under the Equal Protection Clause, McCleskey must prove that the
decisionmakers in *his* case acted with discriminatory purpose. He
offers no evidence specific to his own case that would support an
inference that racial\[ ... \] considerations played a part in his
sentence. Instead, he relies solely on the Baldus
study.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X7a8e6a480df1439c5880c6fb2319e9204330c8a)McCleskey
argues that the Baldus study compels an inference that his sentence
rests on purposeful discrimination. McCleskey\'s claim that these
statistics are sufficient proof of discrimination, without regard to the
facts of a particular case, would extend to all capital cases in
Georgia, at least where the victim was white and the defendant is black.

The Court has accepted statistics as proof of intent to discriminate in
certain limited contexts. First, this Court has accepted statistical
disparities as proof of an equal protection violation in the selection
of the jury venire in a particular district. Although statistical proof
normally must present a \"stark\" pattern to be accepted as the sole
proof of discriminatory intent under the
Constitution,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xaeac90d2ce1420e046a19841f2c18c5fa2e952d)*Arlington
Heights* v. \[294\] *Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,* 429 U. S. 252,
266 (1977), \"\[b\]ecause of the nature of the jury-selection task, . .
. we have permitted a finding of constitutional violation even when the
statistical pattern does not approach \[such\] extremes.\" *Id.,* at
266, n.
13.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X0e296153958b4c16f11b776db11e533bbb61c41)Second,
this Court has accepted statistics in the form of multiple-regression
analysis to prove statutory violations under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. *Bazemore* v. *Friday,* 478 U. S. 385, 400-401
(1986) (opinion of BRENNAN, J., concurring in part).

But the nature of the capital sentencing decision, and the relationship
of the statistics to that decision, are fundamentally different from the
corresponding elements in the venire-selection or Title VII cases. Most
importantly, each particular decision to impose the death penalty is
made by a petit jury selected from a properly constituted venire. Each
jury is unique in its composition, and the Constitution requires that
its decision rest on consideration of innumerable factors that vary
according to the characteristics of the individual defendant and the
facts of the particular capital offense. \[ ... \] Thus, the application
of an inference drawn from the general statistics to a specific decision
in a trial and sentencing simply is not comparable to the application of
an inference drawn from general statistics to a specific
venire-selection\[ ... \]or Title VII case. In those cases, the
statistics relate to fewer
entities,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xc1122d3d3005c41c74c56f1e8a2dd09004cfa92) and
fewer variables are relevant to the challenged
decisions.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xd17850a2c858123fae96e87ec25d30acaa838c1)

\[ ... \]

McCleskey challenges decisions at the heart of the State\'s criminal
justice system.\[ ... \]Because discretion is essential to the criminal
justice process, we would demand exceptionally clear proof before we
would infer that the discretion has been abused. The unique nature of
the decisions at issue in this case also counsels against adopting such
an inference from the disparities indicated by the Baldus study.
Accordingly, we hold that the Baldus study is clearly insufficient to
support an inference that any of the decisionmakers in McCleskey\'s case
acted with discriminatory purpose.

## B

 

McCleskey also suggests that the Baldus study proves that the State as a
whole has acted with a discriminatory purpose. He appears to argue that
the State has violated the Equal\[ ... \] Protection Clause by adopting
the capital punishment statute and allowing it to remain in force
despite its allegedly discriminatory application. \[ ... \] For this
claim to prevail, McCleskey would have to prove that the Georgia
Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute *because of*
an anticipated racially discriminatory effect. \[ ... \] There was no
evidence then, and there is none now, that the Georgia Legislature
enacted the capital punishment statute to further a racially
discriminatory
purpose.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X8042412fec833ce9aa8dfd6081d006ba48ad278)

Nor has McCleskey demonstrated that the legislature maintains the
capital punishment statute because of the racially disproportionate
impact suggested by the Baldus study. As legislatures necessarily have
wide discretion in the choice of criminal laws and penalties, and as
there were \[ ... \]legitimate reasons for the Georgia Legislature to
adopt and maintain capital punishment, \[ ... \] we will not infer a
discriminatory purpose on the part of the State of
Georgia.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xb04e3b89c6a6d628f86a28d50be82a821d8342c)Accordingly,
we reject McCleskey\'s equal protection claims.

McCleskey also argues that the Baldus study demonstrates that the
Georgia capital sentencing system violates the Eighth
Amendment.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X3f5014b4f1d8d251def095e84ca2fea37667906)We
begin our analysis of this claim by reviewing the restrictions on death
sentences established by our prior decisions under that Amendment.

## A

 

The Eighth Amendment prohibits infliction of \"cruel and unusual
punishments.\" \[ ... \]

 

Although our decision in *Gregg* as to the facial validity of the
Georgia capital punishment statute appears to foreclose McCleskey\'s
disproportionality argument, he further contends that the Georgia
capital punishment system is arbitrary and capricious in *application,*
and therefore his sentence is excessive, because racial considerations
may influence capital sentencing decisions in Georgia. \[ ... \]

Even Professor Baldus does not contend that his statistics *prove* that
race enters into any capital sentencing decisions or that race was a
factor in McCleskey\'s particular
case.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X6392b1f6e7e2401884e7f2eece686cfc00f72c0)Statistics
at most may show only a likelihood that a particular factor entered into
some decisions. There is, of course, some risk of racial prejudice
influencing a jury\'s decision in a criminal case. There are similar
risks that other kinds of prejudice will influence other criminal
trials.\[ ... \] The question \[ ... \]\"is at what point that risk
becomes constitutionally unacceptable,\" \[ ... \] McCleskey asks us to
accept the likelihood allegedly shown by the Baldus study as the
constitutional measure of an unacceptable risk of racial prejudice
influencing capital sentencing decisions. This we decline to do.

Because of the risk that the factor of race may enter the criminal
justice process, we have engaged in \"unceasing efforts\" to eradicate
racial prejudice from our criminal justice system. \[ ... \] Our efforts
have been guided by our recognition that \"the inestimable privilege of
trial by jury . . . is a vital principle, underlying the whole
administration of criminal justice,\" \[ ... \] Thus, it is the jury
that is a criminal defendant\'s fundamental \"protection of life and
liberty against race or color prejudice.\"\[ ... \] Specifically, a
capital sentencing jury representative of a criminal defendant\'s
community assures a \" \`diffused impartiality,\' \" \[ ... \]in the
jury\'s task of \"express\[ing\] the conscience of the community on the
ultimate question of life or death,\" \[ ... \]

The capital sentencing decision requires the individual jurors to focus
their collective judgment on the unique characteristics of a particular
criminal defendant. It is not surprising that such collective judgments
often are difficult to explain. But the inherent lack of predictability
of jury decisions does not justify their condemnation. On the contrary,
it is the jury\'s function to make the difficult and uniquely human
judgments that defy codification and that \"buil\[d\] discretion,
equity, and flexibility into a legal system.\" H. Kalven & H. Zeisel,
The American Jury 498 (1966).

McCleskey\'s argument that the Constitution condemns the discretion
allowed decisionmakers in the Georgia capital sentencing system is
antithetical to the fundamental role of discretion in our criminal
justice system. Discretion in the criminal justice system offers
substantial benefits to the criminal defendant. Not only can a jury
decline to impose the death sentence, it can decline to convict or
choose to convict of a lesser offense. \[ ... \] Similarly, the capacity
of prosecutorial discretion \[ ... \] to provide individualized justice
is \"firmly entrenched in American law.\" \[ ... \] Of course, \"the
power to be lenient \[also\] is the power to discriminate,\" K. Davis,
Discretionary Justice 170 (1973), but a capital punishment system that
did not allow for discretionary acts of leniency \"would be totally
alien to our notions of criminal justice.\" *Gregg* v. *Georgia,* 428 U.
S., at 200, n. 50.

## C

 

At most, the Baldus study indicates a discrepancy that appears to
correlate with race. Apparent disparities in sentencing are an
inevitable part of our criminal justice
system.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xc834898590c69703e67f78586976cacbf147652) \[ ...
\] As this Court has recognized, any mode for determining guilt or
punishment \"has its weaknesses and the potential for misuse.\" \[ ...
\]Specifically, \"there can be \`no perfect procedure for deciding in
which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death.\' \"
\[ ... \]Despite these imperfections, our consistent rule has been that
constitutional guarantees are met when \"the mode \[for determining
guilt or punishment\] itself has been surrounded with safeguards to make
it as fair as possible.\" \[ ... \]Where the discretion that is
fundamental to our criminal process is involved, we decline to assume
that what is unexplained is invidious. In light of the safeguards
designed to minimize racial bias in the process, the fundamental value
of jury trial in our criminal justice system, and the benefits that
discretion provides to criminal defendants, we hold that the Baldus
study does not demonstrate a constitutionally significant risk of racial
bias affecting the Georgia capital sentencing
process.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xb1dbfa8c8cb87de05164108dd536279865b9807)

 

## V

 

Two additional concerns inform our decision in this case. First,
McCleskey\'s claim, taken to its logical conclusion,\[ ... \] throws
into serious question the principles that underlie our entire criminal
justice system. The Eighth Amendment is not limited in application to
capital punishment, but applies to all penalties.\[ ... \]Thus, if we
accepted McCleskey\'s claim that racial bias has impermissibly tainted
the capital sentencing decision, we could soon be faced with similar
claims as to other types of
penalty.[^\[\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xd80c4be75e29b4f9a031a40ee20bb89fe7cd006)Moreover,
the claim that his sentence\[ ... \] rests on the irrelevant factor of
race easily could be extended to apply to claims based on unexplained
discrepancies that correlate to membership in other minority
groups,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X92e376150f8cb814907c89e2158352b393c3700)and \[
... \] even to
gender.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X9f0b0e522959b8d38e6c527a296abac3c7deb6b)Similarly,
since McCleskey\'s claim relates to the race of his victim, other claims
could apply with equally logical force to statistical disparities that
correlate with the race or sex of other actors in the criminal justice
system, such as defense
attorneys[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#X7fff33ce05197c94e03c9a6a84b0e6afbfa4bdf)or
judges.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xc569bb51da0839cbf2cb41aa482955a5b9c707d) Also,
there is no logical reason that such a claim need be limited to racial
or sexual bias. If arbitrary and capricious punishment is the touchstone
under the Eighth Amendment, such a claim could --- at least in theory
--- be based upon any arbitrary variable, such as the defendant\'s
facial
characteristics,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xc8d92eb7bae052b4d39b2edc597c233a8c3dbe6)or
the physical attractiveness of the defendant or the
victim,[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xf49f65ead94d7d1259c2b6af6bb1574811a8104) that
some statistical\[ ... \] study indicates may be influential in jury
decisionmaking. As these examples illustrate, there is no limiting
principle to the type of challenge brought by
McCleskey.[^\[\ ...\ \]^](#Xd7d1270eded0bd777f0f68cdf27afc9aaba37d2) The
Constitution does not require that a State eliminate any demonstrable
disparity that correlates with a potentially irrelevant factor in order
to operate a criminal justice system that includes capital punishment.
As we have stated specifically in the context of capital punishment, the
Constitution does not \"plac\[e\] totally unrealistic conditions on its
use.\" *Gregg* v. *Georgia,* 428 U. S., at 199, n. 50.

Second, McCleskey\'s arguments are best presented to the legislative
bodies. \[ ... \]It is the legislatures, the elected representatives of
the people, that are \"constituted to respond to the will and
consequently the moral values of the people.\" *Furman* v. *Georgia,*
408 U. S., at 383 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). Legislatures also are
better qualified to weigh and \"evaluate the results of statistical
studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of
approach that is not available to the courts,\" *Gregg* v. *Georgia,
supra,* at 186. Capital punishment is now the law in more than
two-thirds of our States. It is the ultimate duty of courts to determine
on a case-by-case basis whether these laws are applied consistently with
the Constitution. \[ ... \]

At some point in this case, Warren McCleskey doubtless asked his lawyer
whether a jury was likely to sentence him to die. A candid reply to this
question would have been disturbing. First, counsel would have to tell
McCleskey that few of the details of the crime or of McCleskey\'s past
criminal conduct were more important than the fact that his victim was
white.\[ ... \]Furthermore, counsel would feel bound to tell McCleskey
that defendants charged with killing white victims in Georgia are 4.3
times as likely to be sentenced to death as defendants charged with
killing blacks.\[ ... \]In addition, frankness would compel the
disclosure that it was more likely than not that the race of
McCleskey\'s victim would determine whether he received a death
sentence: 6 of every 11 defendants convicted of killing a white person
would not have received the death penalty if their victims had been
black,\[ ... \]while, among defendants with aggravating and mitigating
factors comparable to McCleskey\'s, 20 of every 34 would not have been
sentenced to die if their victims had been black. \[ ... \]Finally, the
assessment would not be complete without the information that cases
involving black defendants and white victims are more likely to result
in a death sentence than cases featuring any other racial combination of
defendant and victim. \[ ... \]

The Court today \[ ... \] finds no fault in a system in which lawyers
must tell their clients that race casts a\[ ... \]large shadow on the
capital sentencing process. \[ ... \]

## . . .

## B

 

he Court assumes the statistical validity of the Baldus study, and
acknowledges that McCleskey has demonstrated a risk that racial
prejudice plays a role in capital sentencing in Georgia, *ante,* at
\-\-\--, n. 7. Nonetheless, it finds the probability of prejudice
insufficient to create constitutional concern. *Ante,* at \-\-\--. Close
analysis of the Baldus study, however, in light of both statistical
principles and human experience, reveals that the risk that race
influenced McCleskey\'s sentence is intolerable by any imaginable
standard.The Baldus study indicates that, after taking into account some
230 nonracial factors that might legitimately influence a sentencer, the
jury *more likely than not* would have spared McCleskey\'s life had his
victim been black. \[ ... \]

The statistical evidence in this case thus relentlessly documents the
risk that McCleskey\'s sentence was influenced by racial considerations.
This evidence shows that there is a better than even chance in Georgia
that race will influence the decision to impose the death penalty: a
majority of defendants in white-victim crimes would not have been
sentenced to die if their victims had been black. In determining whether
this risk is acceptable, our judgment must be shaped by the awareness
that \"\[t\]he risk of racial prejudice infecting a capital sentencing
proceeding is especially serious in light of the complete finality of
the death sentence,\" \[ ... \]In determining the guilt of a defendant,
a State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, we
refuse to convict if the chance of error is simply less likely than not.
Surely, we should not be willing to take a person\'s life if the chance
that his death sentence was irrationally imposed is *more* likely than
not. In light of the gravity of the interest at stake, petitioner\'s
statistics on their face are a powerful demonstration of the type of
risk that our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has consistently condemned.

## C

 

\[ ... \]

This Court has invalidated portions of the Georgia capital sentencing
system three times over the past 15 years. \[ ... \]

it would be unrealistic to ignore the influence of history in assessing
the plausible implications of McCleskey\'s evidence. \"\[A\]mericans
share a historical experience that has resulted in individuals within
the culture ubiquitously attaching a significance to race that is
irrational and often outside their awareness.\" Lawrence, The Id, The
Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning With Unconscious Racism, 39 Stan.
L. \[333\] Rev. 327 (1987). \[ ... \]

Our cases reflect a realization of the myriad of opportunities for
racial considerations to influence criminal proceedings\[ ... \].

The discretion afforded prosecutors and jurors in the Georgia capital
sentencing system creates such opportunities.\[ ... \]

History and its continuing legacy thus buttress the probative force of
McCleskey\'s statistics.\[ ... \] \"subtle, less consciously held racial
attitudes\" continue to be of concern, 476 U. S., at 35, and the Georgia
system gives such attitudes considerable room to operate. The
conclusions drawn from McCleskey\'s statistical evidence are therefore
consistent with the lessons of social experience.

\[ ... \]The majority thus misreads our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence
in concluding that McCleskey has not demonstrated a degree of risk
sufficient to raise constitutional concern. The determination of the
significance of his evidence is at its core an exercise in human moral
judgment, not a mechanical statistical analysis. It must first and
foremost be informed by awareness of the fact that death is irrevocable,
and that as a result \"the qualitative difference of death from all
other punishments requires a greater degree of scrutiny of the capital
sentencing determination.\" *California* v. *Ramos,* 463 U. S., at
998-999. For this reason, we have demanded a uniquely high degree of
rationality in imposing the death penalty. A capital sentencing system
in which race more likely than not plays a role does not meet this
standard. It is true that every nuance of decision cannot be
statistically captured, nor can any individual judgment be plumbed with
absolute certainty. Yet the fact that we must always act without the
illumination of complete knowledge cannot induce paralysis when we
confront what is literally an issue of life and death. Sentencing data,
history, and experience all counsel that Georgia has provided
insufficient assurance of the heightened rationality we have required in
order to take a human life.

## \[ ... \]

Reliance on race in imposing capital punishment,\[ ... \] is
antithetical to the very rationale for granting sentencing discretion.
\[ ... \]

Considering the race of a defendant or victim in deciding if the death
penalty should be imposed is completely at odds with this concern that
an individual be evaluated as a unique human being. Decisions influenced
by race rest in part on a categorical assessment of the worth of human
beings according to color, insensitive to whatever qualities the
individuals in question may possess. \[ ... \]

\[ ... \]Our desire for individualized moral judgments may lead us to
accept some inconsistencies in sentencing outcomes. \[ ... \] There is
\[ ... \] a presumption that actors in the criminal justice system
exercise their discretion in responsible fashion, and we do not
automatically infer that sentencing patterns that do not comport with
ideal rationality are suspect.

As we made clear in *Batson* v. *Kentucky,* 476 U. S. 79 (1986),
however, that presumption is rebuttable. \[ ... \] The Court\'s position
converts a rebuttable presumption into a virtually conclusive one.

\[ ... \]

\[ ... \]The Court next states that its unwillingness to regard
petitioner\'s evidence as sufficient is based in part on the fear that
recognition of McCleskey\'s claim would open the door to widespread
challenges to all aspects of criminal sentencing. **Taken on its face,
such a statement seems to suggest a fear of too much justice. **

In fairness, the Court\'s fear that McCleskey\'s claim is an invitation
to descend a slippery slope also rests on the realization that any
humanly imposed system of penalties will exhibit some imperfection. Yet
to reject McCleskey\'s powerful evidence on this basis is to ignore both
the qualitatively different character of the death penalty and the
particular repugnance of racial discrimination, considerations which may
\[340\] properly be taken into account in determining whether various
punishments are \"cruel and unusual.\" \[ ... \]

It hardly needs reiteration that this Court has consistently
acknowledged the uniqueness of the punishment of death. \[ ... \]

The Court\'s projection of apocalyptic consequences for criminal
sentencing is thus greatly exaggerated. \[ ... \] Despite its acceptance
of the validity of Warren McCleskey\'s evidence, the Court is willing to
let his death sentence stand because it fears that we cannot
successfully define a different standard for lesser punishments. This
fear is baseless.

Finally, the Court justifies its rejection of McCleskey\'s claim by
cautioning against usurpation of the legislatures\' role in devising and
monitoring criminal punishment. \[ ... \] The fact that \"\[c\]apital
punishment is now the law in more than two thirds of our States,\"\[ ...
\]however, does not diminish the fact that capital punishment is the
most awesome act that a State can perform. The judiciary\'s role in this
society counts for little if the use of governmental power to extinguish
life does not elicit close scrutiny. \[ ... \]

## V

 

At the time our Constitution was framed 200 years ago this year, blacks
\"had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an
inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race,
either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they
had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\" *Dred Scott*
v. *Sandford,* \[344\] 19 How. 393, 407 (1857). Only 130 years ago, this
Court relied on these observations to deny American citizenship to
blacks. *Ibid.* A mere three generations ago, this Court sanctioned
racial segregation, stating that \"\[i\]f one race be inferior to the
other socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them
upon the same plane.\" *Plessy* v. *Ferguson,* 163 U. S. 537, 552
(1896).

In more recent times, we have sought to free ourselves from the burden
of this history. Yet it has been scarcely a generation since this
Court\'s first decision striking down racial segregation, and barely two
decades since the legislative prohibition of racial discrimination in
major domains of national life. These have been honorable steps, but we
cannot pretend that in three decades we have completely escaped the grip
of a historical legacy spanning centuries. Warren McCleskey\'s evidence
confronts us with the subtle and persistent influence of the past. His
message is a disturbing one to a society that has formally repudiated
racism, and a frustrating one to a Nation accustomed to regarding its
destiny as the product of its own will. Nonetheless, we ignore him at
our peril, for we remain imprisoned by the past as long as we deny its
influence in the present.

It is tempting to pretend that minorities on death row share a fate in
no way connected to our own, that our treatment of them sounds no echoes
beyond the chambers in which they die. Such an illusion is ultimately
corrosive, for the reverberations of injustice are not so easily
confined. \"The destinies of the two races in this country are
indissolubly linked together,\" *id.,* at 560 (Harlan, J., dissenting),
and the way in which we choose those who will die reveals the depth of
moral commitment among the living.

\[ ... \]

\[ ... \]JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE
STEVENS join, and with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins in all but Part IV-B,
dissenting.

The Court today sanctions the execution of a man despite his
presentation of evidence that establishes a constitutionally intolerable
level of racially based discrimination leading to the imposition of his
death sentence. \[ ... \]

In sum, McCleskey has demonstrated a clear pattern of differential
treatment according to race that is \"unexplainable on grounds other
than race.\" *Arlington Heights* v. *Metropolitan Housing Development
Corp.,* 429 U. S., at 266.

## III

 

The Court\'s explanations for its failure to apply this well-established
equal protection analysis to this case are not persuasive. \[ ... \]

As discussed above, McCleskey presented evidence of numerous decisions
impermissibly affected by racial factors over a significant number of
cases. \[ ... \]

The Court\'s assertion that, because of the necessity of discretion in
the criminal justice system, it \"would demand exceptionally clear
proof,\" *ante,* at 297, before inferring abuse of that discretion thus
misses the point of the constitutional challenge in this case. \[ ... \]
As the Court concedes, discretionary authority can be discriminatory
authority. \[ ... \] Judicial scrutiny is particularly appropriate in
McCleskey\'s case because \"\[m\]ore subtle, less consciously held
racial attitudes could also influence\" the decisions in the Georgia
capital sentencing system. \[ ... \]The Court\'s rejection of
McCleskey\'s equal protection claims is\[ ... \] a far cry from the
\"sensitive inquiry\" mandated by the Constitution. . .

One of the final concerns discussed by the Court may be the most
disturbing aspect of its opinion. Granting relief to McCleskey in this
case, it is said, could lead to further constitutional challenges. \[
... \] That, of course, is no reason to deny *McCleskey* his rights
under the Equal Protection Clause. If a grant of relief to him were to
lead to a closer examination of the effects of racial considerations
throughout the criminal justice system, the system, and hence society,
might benefit. Where no such factors come into play, the integrity of
the system is enhanced. Where such considerations are shown to be
significant, efforts can be made to eradicate their impermissible
influence and to ensure an evenhanded application of criminal sanctions.

Commentary on McCleskey and Floyd

 

Recent commentary linking McCleskey and Floyd:

"\[L\]anguage in the McCleskey opinion offers another powerful obstacle
to discriminatory\
purpose claims\--allowing, if not encouraging, judges to refuse
inferences of discriminatory\
purpose from statistical disparities, unless litigants are creative in
coupling statistical and\
nonstatistical evidence as the plaintiffs were in Floyd v. City of New
York, New York\'s stop-andfrisk\
case. . . .With racism, and interest in discriminatory purpose doctrine
resurgent, there is\
good reason to examine the constraints on proof of purpose that the
Rehnquist Court\
incorporated into equal protection law as courts were ending the Second
Reconstruction. It may\
be that these constraints on the kinds of evidence that judges may
consider in evaluating claims\
of discriminatory purpose are due for reconsideration.\
Although Justice Powell did not write McCleskey in such a way as to
clarify the conditions\
warranting restrictions on the use of statistical evidence, judges can
read McCleskey with\
attention to these questions. For instance, some courts have implied
that they might consider\
statistical studies that are coupled with circumstantial evidence or
that focus on the specific\
prosecutorial officer or entity at issue. In cases not involving the
death penalty or prosecutorial\
discretion, courts consider statistical evidence of discriminatory
policing without pausing to\
distinguish McCleskey. The use of statistics in these cases present
openings for change. Judges\
may not be moved by the same considerations that seemed to guide the
McCleskey Court,\
especially when judges can see the effects of decades of judicial
abdication. Still, the spirit\
of McCleskey continues to guide many judges. . . ."

"\[S\]ystemic challenges to the operation of the criminal justice
institutions have been wholly\
absent from the Court\'s docket since the 1987 case of McClesky v. Kemp.
In large measure, this\
is because McCleskey established a near-insurmountable barrier to such
challenges. In that\
capital case, . . . \[a\]mong the reasons the Court offered for
declining to entertain even powerful\
statistical evidence, it worried that "if we accepted McCleskey\'s claim
that racial bias has\
impermissibly tainted the capital sentencing decision, we could soon be
faced with similar claims\
as to other types of penalty," including noncapital sentencing. This
concern about what Justice\
Brennan acerbically characterized as "a fear of too much justice"
reoccurs in other instances in\
which criminal justice disparities have been challenged. Absent the
miraculous happenstance of\
testimonial or documentary evidence of bias\--a stroke of luck that
befell plaintiffs in the\
challenge to New York\'s SQF policy \[in Floyd v. City of New
York\]\--McCleskey means that the\
courthouse door is effectively shut to discriminatory-purpose challenges
in the criminal justice\
context. McCleskey . . . drastically narrows litigants\' opportunities
to challenge the role of race in\
criminal justice institutions."

129 N.J. 422 (1992)

609 A.2d 1266

### STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN THE INTEREST OF M.T.S.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey.

Argued January 7, 1992.

Decided July 30, 1992.

\[424\] *Carol M. Henderson,* Deputy Attorney General, argued the cause
for appellant, State of New Jersey (*Robert J. Del Tufo,* Attorney
General of New Jersey, attorney; *Jessica S. Oppenheim,* Deputy Attorney
General, of counsel and on the brief).

*Susan Herman,* Assistant Deputy Public Defender, argued the cause for
respondent M.T.S. (*Wilfredo Caraballo,* Public Defender, attorney).

The opinion of the Court was delivered by HANDLER, J.

Under New Jersey law a person who commits an act of sexual penetration
using physical force or coercion is guilty of second-degree sexual
assault. The sexual assault statute does not define the words \"physical
force.\" The question posed by \[425\] this appeal is whether the
element of \"physical force\" is met simply by an act of non-consensual
penetration involving no more force than necessary to accomplish that
result.

That issue is presented in the context of what is often referred to as
\"acquaintance rape.\" The record in the case discloses that the
juvenile, a seventeen-year-old boy, engaged in consensual kissing and
heavy petting with a fifteen-year-old girl and thereafter engaged in
actual sexual penetration of the girl to which she had not consented.
There was no evidence or suggestion that the juvenile used any unusual
or extra force or threats to accomplish the act of penetration.

The trial court determined that the juvenile was delinquent for
committing a sexual assault. The Appellate Division reversed the
disposition of delinquency, concluding that non-consensual penetration
does not constitute sexual assault unless it is accompanied by some

## I

The issues in this case are perplexing and controversial. We must
explain the role of force in the contemporary crime of sexual assault
and then define its essential features. We then must consider what
evidence is probative to establish the commission of a sexual assault.
The factual circumstances of this case expose the complexity and
sensitivity of those issues and underscore the analytic difficulty of
those seemingly-straightforward legal questions.

On Monday, May 21, 1990, fifteen-year-old C.G. was living with her
mother, her three siblings, and several other people, including M.T.S.
and his girlfriend. A total of ten people resided in the three-bedroom
town-home at the time of the incident. M.T.S., then age seventeen, was
temporarily residing at the home with the permission of the C.G.\'s
mother; he slept \[426\] downstairs on a couch. C.G. had her own room on
the second floor. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on May 21, C.G. went
upstairs to sleep after having watched television with her mother,
M.T.S., and his girlfriend. When C.G. went to bed, she was wearing
underpants, a bra, shorts, and a shirt. At trial, C.G. and M.T.S.
offered very different accounts concerning the nature of their
relationship and the events that occurred after C.G. had gone upstairs.
The trial court did not credit fully either teenager\'s testimony.

C.G. stated that earlier in the day, M.T.S. had told her three or four
times that he \"was going to make a surprise visit up in \[her\]
bedroom.\" She said that she had not taken M.T.S. seriously and
considered his comments a joke because he frequently teased her. She
testified that M.T.S. had attempted to kiss her on numerous other
occasions and at least once had attempted to put his hands inside of her
pants, but that she had rejected all of his previous advances.

C.G. testified that on May 22, at approximately 1:30 a.m., she awoke to
use the bathroom. As she was getting out of bed, she said, she saw
M.T.S., fully clothed, standing in her doorway. According to C.G.,
M.T.S. then said that \"he was going to tease \[her\] a little bit.\"
C.G. testified that she \"didn\'t think anything of it\"; she walked
past him, used the bathroom, and then returned to bed, falling into a
\"heavy\" sleep within fifteen minutes. The next event C.G. claimed to
recall of that morning was waking up with M.T.S. on top of her, her
underpants and shorts removed. She said \"his penis was into \[her\]
vagina.\" As soon as C.G. realized what had happened, she said, she
immediately slapped M.T.S. once in the face, then \"told him to get off
\[her\], and get out.\" She did not scream or cry out. She testified
that M.T.S. complied in less than one minute after being struck;
according to C.G., \"he jumped right off of \[her\].\" She said she did
not know how long M.T.S. had been inside of her before she awoke.

\[427\] C.G. said that after M.T.S. left the room, she \"fell asleep
crying\" because \"\[she\] couldn\'t believe that he did what he did to
\[her\].\" She explained that she did not immediately tell her mother or
anyone else in the house of the events of that morning because she was
\"scared and in shock.\" According to C.G., M.T.S. engaged in
intercourse with her \"without \[her\] wanting it or telling him to come
up \[to her bedroom\].\" By her own account, C.G. was not otherwise
harmed by M.T.S.

At about 7:00 a.m., C.G. went downstairs and told her mother about her
encounter with M.T.S. earlier in the morning and said that they would
have to \"get \[him\] out of the house.\" While M.T.S. was out on an
errand, C.G.\'s mother gathered his clothes and put them outside in his
car; when he returned, he was told that \"\[he\] better not even get
near the house.\" C.G. and her mother then filed a complaint with the
police.

According to M.T.S., he and C.G. had been good friends for a long time,
and their relationship \"kept leading on to more and more.\" He had been
living at C.G.\'s home for about five days before the incident occurred;
he testified that during the three days preceding the incident they had
been \"kissing and necking\" and had discussed having sexual
intercourse. The first time M.T.S. kissed C.G., he said, she \"didn\'t
want him to, but she did after that.\" He said C.G. repeatedly had
encouraged him to \"make a surprise visit up in her room.\"

M.T.S. testified that at exactly 1:15 a.m. on May 22, he entered C.G.\'s
bedroom as she was walking to the bathroom. He said C.G. soon returned
from the bathroom, and the two began \"kissing and all,\" eventually
moving to the bed. Once they were in bed, he said, they undressed each
other and continued to kiss and touch for about five minutes. M.T.S. and
C.G. proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse. According to M.T.S., who
was on top of C.G., he \"stuck it in\" and \"did it \[thrust\] three
times, and then the fourth time \[he\] stuck it in, that\'s when \[she\]
pulled \[him\] off of her.\" M.T.S. said that as \[428\] C.G. pushed him
off, she said \"stop, get off,\" and he \"hopped off right away.\"

According to M.T.S., after about one minute, he asked C.G. what was
wrong; she replied with a back-hand to his face. He recalled asking C.G.
what was wrong a second time, and her replying, \"how can you take
advantage of me or something like that.\" M.T.S. said that he proceeded
to get dressed and told C.G. to calm down, but that she then told him to
get away from her and began to cry. Before leaving the room, he told
C.G., \"I\'m leaving \... I\'m going with my real girlfriend, don\'t
talk to me \... I don\'t want nothing to do with you or anything, stay
out of my life \... don\'t tell anybody about this \... it would just
screw everything up.\" He then walked downstairs and went to sleep.

On May 23, 1990, M.T.S. was charged with conduct that if engaged in by
an adult would constitute second-degree sexual assault of the victim,
contrary to *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1). In addition, he faced unrelated
charges for third-degree theft of movable property, contrary to
*N.J.S.A.* 2C:20-3a, third-degree escape, contrary to *N.J.S.A.*
2C:29-5, and fourth-degree criminal trespass, contrary to *N.J.S.A.*
2C:18-3.

Following a two-day trial on the sexual assault charge, M.T.S. was
adjudicated delinquent. After reviewing the testimony, the court
concluded that the victim had consented to a session of kissing and
heavy petting with M.T.S. The trial court did not find that C.G. had
been sleeping at the time of penetration, but nevertheless found that
she had not consented to the actual sexual act. Accordingly, the court
concluded that the State had proven second-degree sexual assault beyond
a reasonable doubt. On appeal, following the imposition of suspended
sentences on the sexual assault and the other remaining charges, the
Appellate Division determined that the absence of force beyond that
involved in the act of sexual penetration precluded a finding of
second-degree sexual assault. It therefore reversed \[429\] the
juvenile\'s adjudication of delinquency for that offense. 247 *N.J.
Super.* at 260-61, 588 *A.*2d 1282.

## II

The New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1), defines
\"sexual assault\" as the commission \"of sexual penetration\" \"with
another person\" with the use of \"physical force or
coercion.\"[^\[1\]^](#Xeb606890f0a3a28a972ac58881e2fa964af4e87) An
unconstrained reading of the statutory language indicates that both the
act of \"sexual penetration\" and the use of \"physical force or
coercion\" are separate and distinct elements of the offense. *See*
*Medical Soc. v. Department of Law & Pub. Safety,* 120 *N.J.* 18, 26,
575 *A.*2d 1348 (1990) (declaring that no part of a statute should be
considered meaningless or superfluous). Neither the definitions section
of *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1 to -8, nor the remainder of the Code of Criminal
Justice provides assistance in interpreting the words \"physical
force.\" The initial inquiry is, therefore, whether the statutory words
are unambiguous on their face and can be \[430\] understood and applied
in accordance with their plain meaning. The answer to that inquiry is
revealed by the conflicting decisions of the lower courts and the
arguments of the opposing parties. The trial court held that \"physical
force\" had been established by the sexual penetration of the victim
without her consent. The Appellate Division believed that the statute
requires some amount of force more than that necessary to accomplish
penetration.

The parties offer two alternative understandings of the concept of
\"physical force\" as it is used in the statute. The State would read
\"physical force\" to entail any amount of sexual touching brought about
involuntarily. A showing of sexual penetration coupled with a lack of
consent would satisfy the elements of the statute. The Public Defender
urges an interpretation of \"physical force\" to mean force \"used to
overcome lack of consent.\" That definition equates force with violence
and leads to the conclusion that sexual assault requires the application
of some amount of force in addition to the act of penetration.

Current judicial practice suggests an understanding of \"physical
force\" to mean \"any degree of physical power or strength used against
the victim, even though it entails no injury and leaves no mark.\"
*Model Jury Charges, Criminal* 3 (revised Mar. 27, 1989). Resort to
common experience or understanding does not yield a conclusive meaning.
The dictionary provides several definitions of \"force,\" among which
are the following: (1) \"power, violence, compulsion, or constraint
exerted upon or against a person or thing,\" (2) \"a general term for
exercise of strength or power, esp. physical, to overcome resistance,\"
or (3) \"strength or power of any degree that is exercised without
justification or contrary to law upon a person or thing.\" *Webster\'s
Third New International Dictionary* 887 (1961).

Thus, as evidenced by the disagreements among the lower courts and the
parties, and the variety of possible usages, the statutory words
\"physical force\" do not evoke a single \[431\] meaning that is obvious
and plain. Hence, we must pursue avenues of construction in order to
ascertain the meaning of that statutory language. Those avenues are well
charted. When a statute is open to conflicting interpretations, the
court seeks the underlying intent of the legislature, relying on
legislative history and the contemporary context of the statute.
*Monmouth County v. Wissell,* 68 *N.J.* 35, 41-42, 342 *A.*2d 199
(1975). With respect to a law, like the sexual assault statute, that
\"alters or amends the previous law or creates or abolishes types of
actions, it is important, in discovering the legislative intent, to
ascertain the old law, the mischief and the proposed remedy.\" *Grobart
v. Grobart,* 5 *N.J.* 161, 166, 74 *A.*2d 294 (1950); *accord* *Key
Agency v. Continental Casualty Co.,* 31 *N.J.* 98, 155 *A.*2d 547 (1959)
(noting that ambiguous statutory phrases should be interpreted in light
of the occasion and necessity of the law, mischief felt, and remedy in
view). We also remain mindful of the basic tenet of statutory
construction that penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor
of the accused. Nevertheless, the construction must conform to the
intent of the Legislature. *See* *State v. Des Marets,* 92 *N.J.* 62,
68-70, 455 *A.*2d 1074 (1983); *State v. Brown,* 22 *N.J.* 405, 126
*A.*2d 161 (1956).

The provisions proscribing sexual offenses found in the Code of Criminal
Justice, *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1), became effective in 1979, and were
written against almost two hundred years of rape law in New Jersey. The
origin of the rape statute that the current statutory offense of sexual
assault replaced can be traced to the English common law. Under the
common law, rape was defined as \"carnal knowledge of a woman against
her will.\" Cynthia A. Wicktom, Note, *Focusing on the Offender\'s
Forceful Conduct: A Proposal for the Redefinition of Rape Laws,* 56
*Geo.Wash.L.Rev.* 399, 401 (1988) (*Offender\'s Forceful Conduct*).
American jurisdictions generally adopted the English view, but over time
states added the requirement that the carnal knowledge have been
forcible, apparently in order to prove that the act was against the
victim\'s will. *Id.* at 402 \[432\] (citing Rollin Perkins & Ronald
Boyce, *Criminal Law* 211 (3d ed. 1982)). As of 1796, New Jersey
statutory law defined rape as \"carnal knowledge of a woman, forcibly
and against her will.\" Crimes Act of March 18, 1796 § 8, \[1821\]
*N.J.Rev.Laws* (Pennington) 246. Those three elements of rape --- carnal
knowledge, forcibly, and against her will --- remained the essential
elements of the crime until 1979. Leigh Bienen, *Rape III --- National
Developments in Rape Reform Legislation,* 6 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* 170,
207 (1981) (Bienen, *Rape III*).

Under traditional rape law, in order to prove that a rape had occurred,
the state had to show both that force had been used and that the
penetration had been against the woman\'s will. Force was identified and
determined not as an independent factor but in relation to the response
of the victim, which in turn implicated the victim\'s own state of mind.
\"Thus, the perpetrator\'s use of force became criminal only if the
victim\'s state of mind met the statutory requirement. The perpetrator
could use all the force imaginable and no crime would be committed if
the state could not prove additionally that the victim did not
consent.\" National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice,
*Forcible Rape --- An Analysis of Legal Issues* 5 (March 1978)
(*Forcible Rape*). Although the terms \"non-consent\" and \"against her
will\" were often treated as equivalent, see, *e.g.,* *Wilson v. State,*
109 *A.*2d 381 (Del. 1954), *cert. den.,* 348 *U.S.* 983, 75 *S.Ct.*
574, 99 *L.Ed.* 765 (1955), under the traditional definition of rape,
both formulations squarely placed on the victim the burden of proof and
of action. Effectively, a woman who was above the age of consent had
actively and affirmatively to withdraw that consent for the intercourse
to be against her will. As a Delaware court stated, \"If sexual
intercourse is obtained by milder means, or with the consent or silent
submission of the female, it cannot constitute the crime of rape.\"
*State v. Brown,* 83 *A.* 1083, 1084 (O.T. 1912); 75 *C.J.S. Rape* §
11-12 (1952).

The presence or absence of consent often turned on credibility. To
demonstrate that the victim had not consented to the \[433\]
intercourse, and also that sufficient force had been used to accomplish
the rape, the state had to prove that the victim had resisted. According
to the oft-quoted Lord Hale, to be deemed a credible witness, a woman
had to be of good fame, disclose the injury immediately, suffer signs of
injury, and cry out for help. 1 Matthew Hale, *History of the Pleas of
the Crown* 633 (1st ed. 1847). Courts and commentators historically
distrusted the testimony of victims, \"assuming that women lie about
their lack of consent for various reasons: to blackmail men, to explain
the discovery of a consensual affair, or because of psychological
illness.\" *Offender\'s Forceful Conduct, supra,* 56 *Geo. Wash.L.Rev.*
at 403. Evidence of resistance was viewed as a solution to the
credibility problem; it was the \"outward manifestation of nonconsent,
\[a\] device for determining whether a woman actually gave consent.\"
Note, *The Resistance Standard in Rape Legislation,* 18 *Stan.L.Rev.*
680, 689 (1966).

The resistance requirement had a profound effect on the kind of conduct
that could be deemed criminal and on the type of evidence needed to
establish the crime. *See, e.g.,* *State v. Brown,* 127 Wis. 193, 106
*N.W.* 536 (1906) (overturning forcible rape conviction based on
inadequate resistance by the victim); *People v. Dohring,* 59 *N.Y.* 374
(1874). Courts assumed that any woman who was forced to have intercourse
against her will necessarily would resist to the extent of her ability.
*People v. Barnes,* 42 *Cal.*3d 284, 228 *Cal. Rptr.* 228, 721 *P.*2d
110, 117 (1986) (observing that \"\[h\]istorically, it was considered
inconceivable that a woman who truly did not consent to sexual
intercourse would not meet force with force\"). In many jurisdictions
the requirement was that the woman have resisted to the utmost. \"Rape
is not committed unless the woman oppose the man to the utmost limit of
her power.\" *People v. Carey,* 223 *N.Y.* 519, 119 *N.E.* 83 (N.Y.
1918). \"\[A\] mere tactical surrender in the face of an assumed
superior physical force is not enough. Where the penalty for the
defendant may be supreme, so must resistance be unto the uttermost.\"
*Moss v. State,* 208 Miss. 531, 45 *So.*2d 125, 126 (1950). Other states
\[434\] followed a \"reasonableness\" standard, while some required only
sufficient resistance to make non-consent reasonably manifest. *Forcible
Rape, supra,* at 5.

At least by the 1960s courts in New Jersey followed a standard for
establishing resistance that was somewhat less drastic than the
traditional rule. In *State v. Harris,* 70 *N.J. Super.* 9, 174 *A.*2d
645 (1961), the Appellate Division recognized that the \"to the
uttermost\" test was obsolete. *Id.* at 16, 174 *A.*2d 645. \"The fact
that a victim finally submits does not necessarily imply that she
consented. Submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put
in fear, is not consent.\" *Id.* at 16-17, 174 *A.*2d 645. Nonetheless,
the \"resistance\" requirement remained an essential feature of New
Jersey rape law. Thus, in 1965 the Appellate Division stated: \"\[W\]e
have rejected the former test that a woman must resist \`to the
uttermost.\' We only require that she resist as much as she possibly can
under the circumstances.\" *State v. Terry,* 89 *N.J. Super.* 445, 449,
215 *A.*2d 374.

The judicial interpretation of the pre-reform rape law in New Jersey,
with its insistence on resistance by the victim, greatly minimized the
importance of the forcible and assaultive aspect of the defendant\'s
conduct. Rape prosecutions turned then not so much on the forcible or
assaultive character of the defendant\'s actions as on the nature of the
victim\'s response. Note, *Recent Statutory Developments in the
Definition of Forcible Rape,* 61 *Va.L.Rev.* 1500, 1505-07 (1975)
(*Definition of Forcible Rape*). \"\[I\]f a woman assaulted is
physically and mentally able to resist, is not terrified by threats, and
is not in a place and position that resistance would have been useless,
it must be shown that she did, in fact, resist the assault.\" *State v.
Terry, supra,* 89 *N.J. Super.* at 449, 215 *A.*2d 374. Under the
pre-reform law, the resistance offered had to be \"in good faith and
without pretense, with an active determination to prevent the violation
of her person, and must not be merely passive and perfunctory.\" *State
v. Terry, supra,* 89 *N.J. Super.* at 450, 215 *A.*2d 374. That the law
put the rape victim on trial was clear.

\[435\] The resistance requirement had another untoward influence on
traditional rape law. Resistance was necessary not only to prove
non-consent but also to demonstrate that the force used by the defendant
had been sufficient to overcome the victim\'s will. The amount of force
used by the defendant was assessed in relation to the resistance of the
victim. *See, e.g., Tex.Penal Code Ann.* § 21.02 (1974) (repealed 1983)
(stating that \"the amount of force necessary to negate consent is a
relative matter to be judged under all the circumstances, the most
important of which is the resistance of the female\"). In New Jersey the
amount of force necessary to establish rape was characterized as \"\`the
degree of force sufficient to overcome any resistance that had been put
up by the female.\'\" *State v. Terry, supra,* 89 *N.J. Super.* at 451,
215 *A.*2d 374 (quoting jury charge by trial court). Resistance, often
demonstrated by torn clothing and blood, was a sign that the defendant
had used significant force to accomplish the sexual intercourse. Thus,
if the defendant forced himself on a woman, it was her responsibility to
fight back, because force was measured in relation to the resistance she
put forward. Only if she resisted, causing him to use more force than
was necessary to achieve penetration, would his conduct be criminalized.
*See, e.g.,* *Moss v. State, supra,* 45 *So.*2d at 125. Indeed, the
significance of resistance as the proxy for force is illustrated by
cases in which victims were unable to resist; in such cases the force
incident to penetration was deemed sufficient to establish the \"force\"
element of the offense. *E.g.,* *Pomeroy v. State,* 94 *Ind.* 96 (1884);
*State v. Atkins,* 292 *S.W.* 422 (Mo. 1926); *Lee v. State,* 322
*So.*2d 751, 752 (Miss. 1975).

The importance of resistance as an evidentiary requirement set the law
of rape apart from other common-law crimes, particularly in the eyes of
those who advocated reform of rape law in the 1970s. *See, e.g.,* Note,
*The Victim in a Forcible Rape Case: A Feminist View,* 11
*Am.Crim.L.Rev.* 335, 346 (1973). However, the resistance requirement
was not the only special rule applied in the rape context. A host of
evidentiary \[436\] rules and standards of proof distinguished the legal
treatment of rape from the treatment of other crimes. Many jurisdictions
held that a rape conviction could not be sustained if based solely on
the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. *See, e.g.,* *Allison v.
United States,* 409 *F.*2d 445, 448 (D.C. Cir.1969). Often judges added
cautionary instructions to jury charges warning jurors that rape was a
particularly difficult charge to prove. Courts in New Jersey allowed
greater latitude in cross-examining rape victims and in delving into
their backgrounds than in ordinary cases. *State v. Conner,* 97 *N.J.L.*
423, 424, 118 *A.* 211 (Sup.Ct. 1922). Rape victims were required to
make a prompt complaint or have their allegations rejected or viewed
with great skepticism. Some commentators suggested that there be
mandatory psychological testing of rape victims. *E.g.,* 3A *Wigmore on
Evidence* § 924a (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1970).

During the 1970s feminists and others criticized the stereotype that
rape victims were inherently more untrustworthy than other victims of
criminal attack. *See, e.g., House \[of Delegates\] Urges New Definition
of Rape,* 61 *A.B.A.J.* 464 (1975); Note, *Toward a Consent Standard in
the Law of Rape,* 43 *U.Chi.L.Rev.* 613, 638 (1976) (*Toward a Consent
Standard*); *see also* *People v. Barnes, supra,* 721 *P.*2d at 117
(discussing influence of distrust of female rape victims on legal
standards). Reformers condemned such suspicion as discrimination against
victims of rape. *See, e.g., The Legal Bias against Rape Victims,* 61
*A.B.A.J.* 464 (1975). They argued that \"\[d\]istrust of the
complainant\'s credibility \[had\] led to an exaggerated insistence on
evidence of resistance,\" resulting in the victim rather than the
defendant being put on trial. *Toward a Consent Standard, supra* 43
*U.Chi.L.Rev.* at 626. Reformers also challenged the assumption that a
woman would seduce a man and then, in order to protect her virtue, claim
to have been raped. If women are no less trustworthy than other
purported victims of criminal attack, the reformers argued, then women
should face no additional burdens of proving that they had not consented
to or had actively resisted the assault. \[437\] *See* Linda Brookover
Bourque, *Defining Rape* 110 (1989) (declaring objective of reform to
\"bring\[\] legal standards for rape cases in line with those used in
other violent crimes by normalizing requirements for evidence\").

To refute the misguided belief that rape was not real unless the victim
fought back, reformers emphasized empirical research indicating that
women who resisted forcible intercourse often suffered far more serious
injury as a result. Menachem Amir, *Patterns in Forcible Rape,* 164-65,
169-171 (1971); *Definition of Forcible Rape, supra,* 61 *Va.L.Rev.* at
1506; Note, *Elimination of the Resistance Requirement and Other Rape
Law Reforms: The New York Experience,* 47 *Alb.L.Rev.* 871, 872 (1983).
That research discredited the assumption that resistance to the utmost
or to the best of a woman\'s ability was the most reasonable or rational
response to a rape.

The research also helped demonstrate the underlying point of the
reformers that the crime of rape rested not in the overcoming of a
woman\'s will or the insult to her chastity but in the forcible attack
itself --- the assault on her person. Reformers criticized the
conception of rape as a distinctly sexual crime rather than a crime of
violence. They emphasized that rape had its legal origins in laws
designed to protect the property rights of men to their wives and
daughters. Susan Brownmiller, *Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape*
377 (1975); *Acquaintance Rape: The Hidden Crime* 318 (Andrea Parrot &
Laurie Bechhofer, eds. 1991). Although the crime had evolved into an
offense against women, reformers argued that vestiges of the old law
remained, particularly in the understanding of rape as a crime against
the purity or chastity of a woman. *Definition of Forcible Rape, supra,*
61 *Va.L.Rev.* at 1506. The burden of protecting that chastity fell on
the woman, with the state offering its protection only after the woman
demonstrated that she had resisted sufficiently.

That rape under the traditional approach constituted a sexual rather
than an assaultive crime is underscored by the spousal \[438\]
exemption. According to the traditional reasoning, a man could not rape
his wife because consent to sexual intercourse was implied by the
marriage contract. *See, e.g.,* *State v. Smith,* 85 *N.J.* 193, 426
*A.*2d 38 (1981); *see also* Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s
Rts.L.Rep.* at 184, 207 (noting that common-law principles excluded
spouses from prosecution in New Jersey as in most other jurisdictions).
Therefore, sexual intercourse between spouses was lawful regardless of
the force or violence used to accomplish it. *Offender\'s Forceful
Conduct, supra,* 58 *Geo.Wash.L.Rev.* at 402; Note, *To Have and to
Hold: The Marital Rape Exemption and the Fourteenth Amendment,* 99
*Harv.L.Rev.* 1255, 1258-60 (1986); *see also* Hale, *supra,* at 629
(noting that \"a \`ravished\' woman could \`redeem\' the convicted
offender and save him from execution by marrying him\").

Critics of rape law agreed that the focus of the crime should be shifted
from the victim\'s behavior to the defendant\'s conduct, and
particularly to its forceful and assaultive, rather than sexual,
character. Reformers also shared the goals of facilitating rape
prosecutions and of sparing victims much of the degradation involved in
bringing and trying a charge of rape. There were, however, differences
over the best way to redefine the crime. Some reformers advocated a
standard that defined rape as unconsented-to sexual intercourse,
*Towards a Consent Standard, supra,* 43 *U.Chi.L.Rev.* 613; others urged
the elimination of any reference to consent from the definition of rape,
*Offender\'s Forceful Conduct, supra,* 56 *Geo.Wash.L.Rev.* at 401.
Nonetheless, all proponents of reform shared a central premise: that the
burden of showing non-consent should not fall on the victim of the
crime. In dealing with the problem of consent the reform goal was not so
much to purge the entire concept of consent from the law as to eliminate
the burden that had been placed on victims to prove they had not
consented. *Ibid.*

Similarly, with regard to force, rape law reform sought to give
independent significance to the forceful or assaultive conduct of the
defendant and to avoid a definition of force that \[439\] depended on
the reaction of the victim. Traditional interpretations of force were
strongly criticized for failing to acknowledge that force may be
understood simply as the invasion of \"bodily integrity.\" Susan
Estrich, *Rape,* 95 *Yale L.J.* 1087, 1105, (1986). In urging that the
\"resistance\" requirement be abandoned, reformers sought to break the
connection between force and resistance.

## III

The history of traditional rape law sheds clearer light on the factors
that became most influential in the enactment of current law dealing
with sexual offenses. The circumstances surrounding the actual passage
of the current law reveal that it was conceived as a reform measure
reconstituting the law to address a widely-sensed evil and to effectuate
an important public policy. Those circumstances are highly relevant in
understanding legislative intent and in determining the objectives of
the current law.

In October 1971, the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission
promulgated a Final Report and Commentary on its proposed New Jersey
Penal Code. New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, *The New Jersey
Penal Code, Vol. I: Report and Penal Code* (1971). The proposed Code
substantially followed the American Law Institute\'s Model Penal Code
(MPC) with respect to sexual offenses. *See M.P.C.* §§ 213.1 to 213.4.
The proposed provisions did not present a break from traditional rape
law. They would have established two principal sexual offenses:
aggravated rape, a first-degree or second-degree crime involving
egregious circumstances; and rape, a crime of the third-degree. 1971
*Penal Code,* § 2C:14-1(a)(1). Rape was defined as sexual intercourse
with a female to which she was compelled to submit by any threat that
would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution. *Id.* at §
14-1(b)(1). The comments to the MPC, on which the proposed Code was
based, state that \"\[c\]ompulsion plainly implies non-consent,\"
\[440\] and that the words \"compels to submit\" require more than \"a
token initial resistance.\" A.L.I., *MPC,* § 213.1, comments at 306
(revised commentary 1980).

The Legislature did not endorse the Model Penal Code approach to rape.
Rather, it passed a fundamentally different proposal in 1978 when it
adopted the Code of Criminal Justice. *L.* 1978, *c.* 95 § 2C:14-1 to
-7; *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1 to -7. The new statutory provisions covering rape
were formulated by a coalition of feminist groups assisted by the
National Organization of Women (NOW) National Task Force on Rape.
Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* at 207. Both houses
of the Legislature adopted the NOW bill, as it was called, without major
changes and Governor Byrne signed it into law on August 10, 1978. *Id.*
at 207-08. The NOW bill had been modeled after the 1976 Philadelphia
Center for Rape Concern Model Sex Offense Statute. Leigh Bienen, *Rape
II,* 3 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* 90 (1977). The Model Sex Offense Statute in
turn had been based on selected provisions of the Michigan Criminal
Sexual Conduct Statute, *Mich. Stat. Ann.* § 28.788(4)(b) (Callaghan
1990), \[M.C.L.A. § 750.520d\] and on the reform statutes in New Mexico,
Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s
Rts.L.Rep.* at 207. The stated intent of the drafters of the
Philadelphia Center\'s Model Statute had been to remove all features
found to be contrary to the interests of rape victims. John M. Cannel,
*New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated* 279 (1991). According to its
proponents the statute would \"\`normalize the law. We are no longer
saying rape victims are likely to lie. What we are saying is that rape
is just like other violent crimes.\'\" Stuart Marques, *Women\'s
Coalition Lauds Trenton Panel: Tough Rape Law Revisions Advance, Newark
Star Ledger,* (May 10, 1978) at 1 (quoting Roberta Kaufman, New Jersey
Coalition Against Rape).

Since the 1978 reform, the Code has referred to the crime that was once
known as \"rape\" as \"sexual assault.\" The crime now requires
\"penetration,\" not \"sexual intercourse.\" It requires \"force\" or
\"coercion,\" not \"submission\" or \"resistance.\" \[441\] It makes no
reference to the victim\'s state of mind or attitude, or conduct in
response to the assault. It eliminates the spousal exception based on
implied consent. It emphasizes the assaultive character of the offense
by defining sexual penetration to encompass a wide range of sexual
contacts, going well beyond traditional \"carnal
knowledge.\"[^\[2\]^](#Xe706b78f8006950f839361bd2b6b9f3812b61bc)
Consistent with the assaultive character, as opposed to the traditional
sexual character, of the offense, the statute also renders the crime
gender-neutral: both males and females can be actors or victims.

The reform statute defines sexual assault as penetration accomplished by
the use of \"physical force\" or \"coercion,\" but it does not define
either \"physical force\" or \"coercion\" or enumerate examples of
evidence that would establish those elements. Some reformers had argued
that defining \"physical force\" too specifically in the sexual offense
statute might have the effect of limiting force to the enumerated
examples. Bienen, *Rape III, supra,* 6 *Women\'s Rts.L.Rep.* at 181. The
task of defining \"physical force\" therefore was left to the courts.

That definitional task runs the risk of undermining the basic
legislative intent to reformulate rape law. *See* Susan Estrich, *Real
Rape* 60 (1987) (noting that under many modern formulations of rape
\"\[t\]he prohibition of force or \`forcible compulsion\' ends up being
defined in terms of a woman\'s resistance\"). That risk was encountered
by the Michigan Supreme Court in *People v. Patterson,* 428 *Mich.* 502,
410 *N.W.*2d 733 (1987). That court considered the sufficiency of the
evidence of force or coercion in the prosecution of a sexual contact
charge against a defendant who had placed his hands on the genital area
of a seventeen-year-old girl while she was sleeping. A majority of
\[442\] the court concluded that the defendant had not used force as
required by the statute because there was \"no evidence of physical
overpowering \... \[and\] there was no submission.\" *Id.* 410 *N.W.*2d
at 740. Justice Boyle, in dissent, soundly criticized the majority\'s
position as a distortion of the legislature\'s intent to protect the
sexual privacy of persons from the use of force, coercion, or other
undue advantage. Concluding that the statute did not require a showing
of any extra force, Justice Boyle pointed out that in \"defin\[ing\]
force by measuring the degree of resistance by the victim,\" the
majority had effectively \"reintroduc\[ed\] the resistance requirement,
when the proper focus ought to be on whether the contact was
unpermitted.\" *Id.* at 747-49.

Unlike the Michigan statute interpreted in *Patterson,* the New Jersey
Code of Criminal Justice does not refer to force in relation to
\"overcoming the will\" of the victim, or to the \"physical
overpowering\" of the victim, or the \"submission\" of the victim. It
does not require the demonstrated non-consent of the victim. As we have
noted, in reforming the rape laws, the Legislature placed primary
emphasis on the assaultive nature of the crime, altering its constituent
elements so that they focus exclusively on the forceful or assaultive
conduct of the defendant.

The Legislature\'s concept of sexual assault and the role of force was
significantly colored by its understanding of the law of assault and
battery. As a general matter, criminal battery is defined as \"the
unlawful application of force to the person of another.\" 2 Wayne LaFave
& Austin Scott, *Criminal Law,* § 7.15 at 301 (1986). The application of
force is criminal when it results in either (a) a physical injury or (b)
an offensive touching. *Id.* at 301-02. Any \"unauthorized touching of
another \[is\] a battery.\" *Perna v. Pirozzi,* 92 *N.J.* 446, 462, 457
*A.*2d 431 (1983). Thus, by eliminating all references to the victim\'s
state of mind and conduct, and by broadening the definition of
penetration to cover not only sexual intercourse \[443\] between a man
and a woman but a range of acts that invade another\'s body or compel
intimate contact, the Legislature emphasized the affinity between sexual
assault and other forms of assault and battery.

The intent of the Legislature to redefine rape consistent with the law
of assault and battery is further evidenced by the legislative treatment
of other sexual crimes less serious than and derivative of traditional
rape. The Code redefined the offense of criminal sexual contact to
emphasize the involuntary and personally-offensive nature of the
touching. *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1(d). Sexual contact is criminal under the
same circumstances that render an act of sexual penetration a sexual
assault, namely, when \"physical force\" or \"coercion\" demonstrates
that it is unauthorized and offensive. *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-3(b). Thus, just
as any unauthorized touching is a crime under traditional laws of
assault and battery, so is any unauthorized sexual contact a crime under
the reformed law of criminal sexual contact, and so is any unauthorized
sexual penetration a crime under the reformed law of sexual assault.

The understanding of sexual assault as a criminal battery, albeit one
with especially serious consequences, follows necessarily from the
Legislature\'s decision to eliminate non-consent and resistance from the
substantive definition of the offense. Under the new law, the victim no
longer is required to resist and therefore need not have said or done
anything in order for the sexual penetration to be unlawful. The alleged
victim is not put on trial, and his or her responsive or defensive
behavior is rendered immaterial. We are thus satisfied that an
interpretation of the statutory crime of sexual assault to require
physical force in addition to that entailed in an act of involuntary or
unwanted sexual penetration would be fundamentally inconsistent with the
legislative purpose to eliminate any consideration of whether the victim
resisted or expressed non-consent.

\[444\] We note that the contrary interpretation of force --- that the
element of force need be extrinsic to the sexual act --- would not only
reintroduce a resistance requirement into the sexual assault law, but
also would immunize many acts of criminal sexual *contact* short of
penetration. The characteristics that make a sexual contact unlawful are
the same as those that make a sexual penetration unlawful. An actor is
guilty of criminal sexual contact if he or she commits an act of sexual
contact with another using \"physical force\" or \"coercion.\"
*N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-3(b). That the Legislature would have wanted to
decriminalize unauthorized sexual intrusions on the bodily integrity of
a victim by requiring a showing of force in addition to that entailed in
the sexual contact itself is hardly possible.

Because the statute eschews any reference to the victim\'s will or
resistance, the standard defining the role of force in sexual
penetration must prevent the possibility that the establishment of the
crime will turn on the alleged victim\'s state of mind or responsive
behavior. We conclude, therefore, that any act of sexual penetration
engaged in by the defendant without the affirmative and freely-given
permission of the victim to the specific act of penetration constitutes
the offense of sexual assault. Therefore, physical force in excess of
that inherent in the act of sexual penetration is not required for such
penetration to be unlawful. The definition of \"physical force\" is
satisfied under *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1) if the defendant applies any
amount of force against another person in the absence of what a
reasonable person would believe to be affirmative and freely-given
permission to the act of sexual penetration.

Under the reformed statute, permission to engage in sexual penetration
must be affirmative and it must be given freely, but that permission may
be inferred either from acts or statements reasonably viewed in light of
the surrounding circumstances. *See Ill. Rev. Stat. ch.* 38, para. 12-17
(1984) (defining consent as \"freely given agreement\"); *see also,*
*People v.* \[445\] *Patterson, supra,* 410 *N.W.*2d at 749 (Boyle, J.,
dissenting) (reasoning that \"force\" may include \"a sexual touching
brought about involuntarily,\" and may consist of \"a contact which
occurs before consent can be given or refused\"); *cf. N.J.S.A.*
2C:2-10(c)(3) (indicating that \"consent\" does not constitute a defense
sufficient to negate an element of a crime if consent was induced or
accomplished by force or coercion). Persons need not, of course,
expressly announce their consent to engage in intercourse for there to
be affirmative permission. Permission to engage in an act of sexual
penetration can be and indeed often is indicated through physical
actions rather than words. Permission is demonstrated when the evidence,
in whatever form, is sufficient to demonstrate that a reasonable person
would have believed that the alleged victim had affirmatively and freely
given authorization to the act.

Our understanding of the meaning and application of \"physical force\"
under the sexual assault statute indicates that the term\'s inclusion
was neither inadvertent nor redundant. The term \"physical force,\" like
its companion term \"coercion,\" acts to qualify the nature and
character of the \"sexual penetration.\" Sexual penetration accomplished
through the use of force is unauthorized sexual penetration. That
functional understanding of \"physical force\" encompasses the notion of
\"unpermitted touching\" derived from the Legislature\'s decision to
redefine rape as a sexual assault. As already noted, under assault and
battery doctrine, any amount of force that results in either physical
injury or offensive touching is sufficient to establish a battery.
Hence, as a description of the method of achieving \"sexual
penetration,\" the term \"physical force\" serves to define and explain
the acts that are offensive, unauthorized, and unlawful.

That understanding of the crime of sexual assault fully comports with
the public policy sought to be effectuated by the Legislature. In
redefining rape law as sexual assault, the Legislature adopted the
concept of sexual assault as a crime against the bodily integrity of the
victim. Although it is \[446\] possible to imagine a set of rules in
which persons must demonstrate affirmatively that sexual contact is
unwanted or not permitted, such a regime would be inconsistent with
modern principles of personal autonomy. The Legislature recast the law
of rape as sexual assault to bring that area of law in line with the
expectation of privacy and bodily control that long has characterized
most of our private and public law. *See* *Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle
Paint Oil Co.,* 129 *N.J.* 81, 94-96, 609 *A.*2d 11 (1992) (recognizing
importance of constitutional and common-law protection of personal
privacy); *id.* at 106, 609 *A.*2d 11 (Pollock, J., concurring)
(emphasizing that common-law right of privacy protects individual
self-determination and autonomy). In interpreting \"physical force\" to
include any touching that occurs without permission we seek to respect
that goal.

Today the law of sexual assault is indispensable to the system of legal
rules that assures each of us the right to decide who may touch our
bodies, when, and under what circumstances. The decision to engage in
sexual relations with another person is one of the most private and
intimate decisions a person can make. Each person has the right not only
to decide whether to engage in sexual contact with another, but also to
control the circumstances and character of that contact. No one, neither
a spouse, nor a friend, nor an acquaintance, nor a stranger, has the
right or the privilege to force sexual contact. *See Definition of
Forcible Rape, supra,* 61 *Va.L.Rev.* at 1529 (arguing that \"forcible
rape is viewed as a heinous crime primarily because it is a violent
assault on a person\'s bodily security, particularly degrading because
that person is forced to submit to an act of the most intimate
nature\").

We emphasize as well that what is now referred to as \"acquaintance
rape\" is not a new phenomenon. Nor was it a \"futuristic\" concept in
1978 when the sexual assault law was enacted. Current concern over the
prevalence of forced sexual intercourse between persons who know one
another reflects both greater awareness of the extent of such behavior
and a growing appreciation of its gravity. Notwithstanding the \[447\]
stereotype of rape as a violent attack by a stranger, the vast majority
of sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone known to the victim.
*Acquaintance Rape, supra,* at 10. One respected study indicates that
more than half of all rapes are committed by male relatives, current or
former husbands, boyfriends or lovers. Diana Russell, *The Prevalence
and Incidence of Forcible Rape and Attempted Rape of Females,* 7
*Victimology* 81 (1982). Similarly, contrary to common myths,
perpetrators generally do not use guns or knives and victims generally
do not suffer external bruises or cuts. *Acquaintance Rape, supra,* at
10. Although this more realistic and accurate view of rape only recently
has achieved widespread public circulation, it was a central concern of
the proponents of reform in the 1970s. *Id.* at 18.

The insight into rape as an assaultive crime is consistent with our
evolving understanding of the wrong inherent in forced sexual intimacy.
It is one that was appreciated by the Legislature when it reformed the
rape laws, reflecting an emerging awareness that the definition of rape
should correspond fully with the experiences and perspectives of rape
victims. Although reformers focused primarily on the problems associated
with convicting defendants accused of violent rape, the recognition that
forced sexual intercourse often takes place between persons who know
each other and often involves little or no violence comports with the
understanding of the sexual assault law that was embraced by the
Legislature. Any other interpretation of the law, particularly one that
defined force in relation to the resistance or protest of the victim,
would directly undermine the goals sought to be achieved by its reform.

## IV

In a case such as this one, in which the State does not allege violence
or force extrinsic to the act of penetration, the factfinder must decide
whether the defendant\'s act of penetration was undertaken in
circumstances that led the defendant reasonably \[448\] to believe that
the alleged victim had freely given affirmative permission to the
specific act of sexual penetration. Such permission can be indicated
either through words or through actions that, when viewed in the light
of all the surrounding circumstances, would demonstrate to a reasonable
person affirmative and freely-given authorization for the specific act
of sexual penetration.

In applying that standard to the facts in these cases, the focus of
attention must be on the nature of the defendant\'s actions. The role of
the factfinder is not to decide whether reasonable people may engage in
acts of penetration without the permission of others. The Legislature
answered that question when it enacted the reformed sexual assault
statute: reasonable people do not engage in acts of penetration without
permission, and it is unlawful to do so. The role of the factfinder is
to decide not whether engaging in an act of penetration without
permission of another person is reasonable, but only whether the
defendant\'s belief that the alleged victim had freely given affirmative
permission was reasonable.

In these cases neither the alleged victim\'s subjective state of mind
nor the reasonableness of the alleged victim\'s actions can be deemed
relevant to the offense. The alleged victim may be questioned about what
he or she did or said only to determine whether the defendant was
reasonable in believing that affirmative permission had been freely
given. To repeat, the law places no burden on the alleged victim to have
expressed non-consent or to have denied permission, and no inquiry is
made into what he or she thought or desired or why he or she did not
resist or protest.

In short, in order to convict under the sexual assault statute in cases
such as these, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there
was sexual penetration and that it was accomplished without the
affirmative and freely-given permission of the alleged victim. As we
have indicated, such proof can be based on evidence of conduct or words
in light of \[449\] surrounding circumstances and must demonstrate
beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would not have
believed that there was affirmative and freely-given permission. If
there is evidence to suggest that the defendant reasonably believed that
such permission had been given, the State must demonstrate either that
defendant did not actually believe that affirmative permission had been
freely-given or that such a belief was unreasonable under all of the
circumstances. Thus, the State bears the burden of proof throughout the
case.

In the context of a sexual penetration not involving unusual or added
\"physical force,\" the inclusion of \"permission\" as an aspect of
\"physical force\" effectively subsumes and obviates any defense based
on consent. *See N.J.S.A.* 2C:2-10c(3). The definition of \"permission\"
serves to define the \"consent\" that otherwise might allow a defendant
to avoid criminal liability. Because \"physical force\" as an element of
sexual assault in this context requires the *absence* of affirmative and
freely-given permission, the \"consent\" necessary to negate such
\"physical force\" under a defense based on consent would require the
*presence* of such affirmative and freely-given permission. Any lesser
form of consent would render the sexual penetration unlawful and cannot
constitute a defense.

In this case, the Appellate Division concluded that non-consensual
penetration accomplished with no additional physical force or coercion
is not criminalized under the sexual assault statute. 247 *N.J. Super.*
at 260, 588 *A.*2d 1282. It acknowledged that its conclusion was
\"anomalous\" because it recognized that \"a woman has every right to
end \[physically intimate\] activity without sexual penetration.\"
*Ibid.* Thus, it added to its holding that \"\[e\]ven the force of
penetration might\... be sufficient if it is shown to be employed to
overcome the victim\'s unequivocal expressed desire to limit the
encounter.\" *Ibid.*

The Appellate Division was correct in recognizing that a woman\'s right
to end intimate activity without penetration is a \[450\] protectable
right the violation of which can be a criminal offense. However, it
misperceived the purpose of the statute in believing that the only way
that right can be protected is by the woman\'s unequivocally-expressed
desire to end the activity. The effect of that requirement would be to
import into the sexual assault statute the notion that an assault occurs
only if the victim\'s will is overcome, and thus to reintroduce the
requirement of non-consent and victim-resistance as a constituent
material element of the crime. Under the reformed statute, a person\'s
failure to protest or resist cannot be considered or used as
justification for bodily invasion.

We acknowledge that cases such as this are inherently fact sensitive and
depend on the reasoned judgment and common sense of judges and juries.
The trial court concluded that the victim had not expressed consent to
the act of intercourse, either through her words or actions. We conclude
that the record provides reasonable support for the trial court\'s
disposition.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and
reinstate the disposition of juvenile delinquency for the commission of
second-degree sexual assault.

People v. Voymas

 

New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division

39 A.D.3d 1182, 833 N.Y.S.2d 823

2007-04-20

\[833 NYS2d 823\]---

Appeal from a judgment of the Ontario County Court (Craig J. Doran, J.),
rendered March 7, 2006. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury
verdict, of rape in the first degree, incest, sexual abuse in the first
degree and sexual abuse in the second degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from be and the same
hereby is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him following a jury
trial of, inter alia, rape in the first degree (Penal Law § 130.35
\[1\]), defendant contends that the evidence of forcible compulsion is
legally insufficient to support the conviction of rape. We reject that
contention. In reviewing the evidence of forcible compulsion, we must
"focus \... on the state of mind produced in the victim by the
defendant's conduct" *(People v Thompson,* 72 NY2d 410, 416 \[1988\],
*rearg denied* 73 NY2d 870 \[1989\]), "and relevant factors include the
age of the victim, the relative size and strength of the defendant and
victim, and the nature of the defendant's relationship to the victim"
*(People v Sehn,* 295 AD2d 749, 750 \[2002\], *lv denied* 98 NY2d 732
\[2002\]). Thus, the proper inquiry "is not what the defendant would or
could have done, 'but rather what the victim, observing \[the
defendant's\] conduct, feared \[he\] would or might do if \[the victim\]
did not comply with \[his\] demands' " *(Thompson,* 72 NY2d at 415-416,
quoting *People v Coleman,* 42 NY2d 500, 505 \[1977\]; see *People v
Davis, 21* AD3d 590, 591-592 \[2005\]).

In this case the victim, defendant's younger sister, testified that
defendant and their other brother began to abuse her sexually when she
was five years old. Initially, the victim would try to fight them off
but she was not successful because they were older and physically larger
than the victim. With respect to the rape, the victim testified that she
pretended to be asleep and tried to keep her legs closed, but defendant
pulled them apart. The victim did not fight harder because she had
learned from past experience that, the more she fought, the more she
would be hurt.

We thus conclude that "the victim's testimony, coupled with evidence of
defendant's forcible compulsion upon \[the victim\] prior to the date in
question, enabled a rational fact finder to conclude that she was
subjected to such compulsion on this date as well" *(People v Peraza,*
288 AD2d 689, 691, *lv denied* 97 NY2d 707 \[2002\]; *see generally
People v Cook,* 93 NY2d 840, 841 \[1999\]).

Defendant further contends that the verdict is against the weight of the
evidence because the victim's testimony is not credible. "Testimony will
be deemed incredible only where it is impossible of belief because it is
manifestly untrue, physically impossible, contrary to experience, or
self-contradictory . . . , and that is not the case with respect to the
victim's testimony" *(People v Ptak,* 37 AD3d 1081, 1081 \[2007\]
\[internal quotation marks omitted\]).

We conclude that County Court properly admitted defendant's unsigned
statement in evidence. The record establishes that defendant was given a
copy of the statement, that he made numerous corrections to it and that
he added a handwritten comment. We thus conclude that defendant in
effect "acknowledged \[the\] accuracy" of the statement *(People v
DaCosta,* 201 AD2d 402, 402 \[1994\], *lv denied* 83 NY2d 871 \[1994\];
*see People v Ramirez,* 284 AD2d 161, 162 \[2001\], *lv denied* 97 NY2d
687 \[2001\]; *cf. People v Lee,* 159 AD 2d 238 \[1990\], *lv denied* 76
NY2d 791 \[1990\]). We likewise conclude that the court properly refused
to redact certain excerpts from the statement. Each excerpt constituted
relevant evidence *(see generally People v Alvino,* 71 NY2d 233, 241
\[1987\]), and the questions of the police detective in the excerpts
were "not hearsay because \[they were\] not offered for \[their\] truth,
but to show defendant's response\[s\] to the \[detective's\] words, . .
. response\[s\] that pointed to defendant's consciousness of guilt"
*(People v Scott,* 203 AD2d 911, 911-912 \[1994\], *lv denied* 83 NY2d
971 \[1994\]).

Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that he was
penalized for asserting his right to a trial based on the fact that he
received a greater sentence after trial than that offered before trial
*(see People v Hurley,* 75 NY2d 887, 888 \[1990\]; *People v Irrizarry,*
37 AD3d 1082 \[2007\]). In any event, that contention lacks merit *(see
Irrizarry,* 37 AD3d 1082 \[2007\]; *see also People v Smith,* 21 AD3d
1277, 1278 \[2005\], *lv denied* 7 NY3d 763 \[2006\]; *People v
Urrutia,* 2 AD3d 1475 \[2003\], *lv denied* 2 NY3d 765 \[2004\]).
Finally, the sentence is not unduly harsh or severe. Present---Scudder,
P.J., Smith, Fahey, Peradotto and Pine, JJ.

### THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, Respondent,

### v.

### CHARLES Rlzzo, Appellant, Impleaded with Others.

Court of Appeals of New York.

Argued October 17, 1927.

Decided November 22, 1927.

**\[ ... \]**

APPEAL, by permission, from a**\[ ... \]** judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court in the first judicial department, entered
June 24, 1927, which affirmed a judgment of the Bronx County Court
entered upon a verdict convicting the defendant of the crime of
attempted robbery in the first degree.

**\[ ... \]**

 

CRANE, J.

The police of the city of New York did excellent work in this case by
preventing the commission of a serious crime. It is a great satisfaction
to realize that we have such wide­-awake guardians of our peace. Whether
or not the steps which the defendant had taken up to the time of his
arrest amounted to the commission of at crime, as defined by our law,
is, however, another matter. He has been convicted of an attempt to
commit the crime of robbery in the first degree and sentenced to State's
prison. There is no. doubt that he had the intention to commit robbery
if he got the chance. An examination, however, of the facts is necessary
to determine whether his acts were in preparation to commit the crime if
the opportunity offered, or constituted a crime in itself, known to our
law as an attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. Charles Rizzo,
the defendant, appellant, with three others, Anthony Dorio, Thomas Milo
and John Thomasello, on January 14th planned to rob one Charles Rao of
a**\[ ... \]** payroll valued at about \$31,200 which he was to carry
from the bank for the United Lathing Company. These defendants, two of
whom had firearms, started out in an automobile, looking for Rao or *the
man who* had the payroll on that day. Rizzo claimed to be able to
identify the man and was to point him out to the others who were to do
the actual holding up. . The four rode about in their car looking for
Rao. They went to the bank from which he was supposed to get the money
and to various buildings being constructed by the United Lathing
Company. At last they came to One Hundred and Eightieth street and
Morris Park avenue. By this time they were watched and followed by two
police officers. As Rizzo jumped out of the car and ran into the
building all- four were arrested. The defendant was taken out from the
building in which he was hiding. Neither Rao nor a man named Previti,
who was also supposed to carry a payroll, were at the place at the time
of the arrest. The defendants had not found or seen the man they
intended to rob; no person with a payroll was at any of the places where
they had stopped no one had been pointed out or identified by Rizzo. The
four \`men intended to rob the payroll man, whoever he was; they were
looking for him, but they had not seen or discovered him up to the time
they were arrested.

Does this constitute the crime of an attempt to commit robbery in the
first degree? The Penal Law, section 2, prescribes, An act, done with
intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its
commission, is \"an attempt to commit that crime\". The word tending is
very indefinite. It is perfectly evident that there will arise
differences of opinion as to whether an act in a**\[ ... \]** given case
is one tending**\[ ... \]** to commit a crime. Tending means to exert
activity in a particular direction. Any act in preparation to commit a
crime may be said to have a tendency towards its accomplishment. The
procuring of the automobile, searching the streets looking for the
desired victim, were in reality acts tending toward the commission of
the proposed crime. The law, however, has recognized that many acts in
the way of preparation are too remote to constitute the crime of
attempt. The line has been drawn between those acts which are remote and
those which are proximate and near to the consummation. The law must be
practical, and, therefore, considers those acts only as tending to the
commission of the crime which are so near to its accomplishment that in
all reasonable probability the crime itself would**\[ ... \]** have been
committed but for timely interference.**\[ ... \]** The cases which have
been before the courts express this idea in different language, but the
idea remains the same. The act or acts must come or advance very near to
the accomplishment of the intended crime. In People Mills (178 N. Y.
274,284) it was said: "Felonious intent alone is not enough, but there
must be an overt: act shown in order to establish even an attempt. An
overt act is one done to carry out the intention, and it must be such as
would naturally effect that result, unless prevented by some extraneous
cause." In Hyde V. U. S. (225 U. S. 347) it was stated that the act
amounts to an attempt when it is so near to the result that the danger,
of success is very great. There must be dangerous proximity to success."
Halsbury in his Laws of England" (Vol. IX, p. 259) says: "An act, in
order to be a criminal attempt, must be immediately, and not remotely,
connected with and directly tending to the commission of an offence."
Commonwealth V. Peaslee (177 Mass. 267) refers to the acts constituting
an attempt as coming very near to the accomplishment of the crime.

The method of committing or attempting crime varies in each case so that
the difficulty, if any, is not with this rule of law regarding an
attempt, which is well understood, but with its application to the
facts. As I have said before, minds differ over proximity and the
nearness of the approach. (People V. Collins, 234 N. Y. 355; People V.
Sobieskoda, 235 N. Y. 411; People V. Werblow, 241 N.Y. 55.)

How shall we apply this rule of immediate nearness to this case? The
defendants were looking for**\[ ... \]** the payroll man to rob him of
his money. This is the charge **\[ ... \]**in the indictment. Robbery is
defined in section 2120 of the Penal Law as the unlawful taking of
personal property, from the person or in the presence of another,
against his will, by means of force, or violence, or fear of injury,
immediate or future, to his person; and it is made robbery in the first
degree by section 2124 when committed by a person aided by accomplices
actually present. To constitute the crime of**\[ ... \]** robbery the
money must have been taken from Rao by means of force or violence, or
through fear. The crime of attempt to commit robbery was committed if
these defendants did any act tending to the commission of this robbery.
Did the acts above describe come dangerously near to the taking of Rao's
property? Did the acts come so near the commission of robbery that there
was reasonable likelihood of its accomplishment but for the
interference? Rao was not found the defendants were still looking for
him; no attempt to rob him could be made, at least until he came in
sight; he was not in the building at One Hundred and Eightieth street
and Morris Park avenue. There was no man there with the payroll for the
United Lathing Company whom these defendants could rob. Apparently no
money had been drawn from the bank for the payroll by anybody at the
time of the arrest. In a word, these defendants had planned to commit a
crime and were looking around the city for an opportunity to commit it,
but the opportunity fortunately never came. Men would not be guilty of
an attempt at burglary if they had planned to break into a building and
were arrested while they were hunting about the streets for the building
not knowing where it was. Neither would a man be guilty of an attempt to
commit murder if he armed himself and started out to find the person
whom he had planned to kill but could not find him. So here these
defendants were not guilty of an attempt to commit robbery in the first
degree when they had not found or reached the presence of the person
they intended to rob. (People v. Sullivan, 173 N. Y. 122, 135.)

For these reasons, the judgment of conviction of this defendant,
appellant, must be reversed and a new trial granted.\
A very strange situation has arisen in this case.. I called attention to
the four defendants who were convicted of this crime of an attempt to
commit robbery in the first degree. They were all tried together upon
the same**\[ ... \]** evidence, and jointly convicted, and all sentenced
to State's prison for varying terms. Rizzo was the only\` one of the
four to appeal to the Appellate Division and to this court. His
conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division by a divided court,
two of the justices dissenting, and we have now he1d that he was not
guilty of the crime charged. If he were not guilty, neither were the
other three. As the others, however, did not appeal, there is no remedy
for them through the court; their judgments stand, and they must serve
their sentences. This of course is a situation which must in all
fairness be met in some way. Two of these men were guilty of the crime
of carrying weapons, pistols, contrary to law, for which they could be
convicted. Two of them, John Thomasello and Thomas Milo, had also been
previously convicted, which may have had something to do with their
neglect to appeal. However, the law would fail in its function and its
purpose if it permitted these three men whoever or whatever they are to
serve a sentence for a crime which the courts subsequently found and
declared had not been committed. We, therefore, suggest to the district
attorney of Bronx county that he bring the cases of these three men to
the attention of the Governor to be dealt with as to him seems proper in
the light of this opinion.

The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the County Court
should be reversed and a new trial ordered.

KELLOGG and O'BR1EN, JJ., concur.

Judgment accordingly.

## \[180\] KAYE, J.

In a case involving a staged theft of Persian antiquities, with the
objective of recovering \$18.5 million in insurance proceeds, the
central issues on appeal are whether joint trial of the two defendants
was proper, and whether the acts charged amounted to attempted grand
larceny and burglary.

## I.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People, the
proof was sufficient to show that the defendants entered into a
conspiracy to stage a burglary of defendant Houshang Mahboubian\'s
collection of gold and silver Persian antiquities. Three art experts
testified for the People that several pieces in the collection were of
dubious authenticity, and indeed almost certainly modern forgeries. From
the testimony of other witnesses, the jury could have concluded that
Mahboubian became aware of this before the burglaries, and had been
unsuccessful in his efforts to sell the collection.

In the summer of 1985, Mahboubian insured the collection with Lloyd\'s
of London for \$18.5 million, covering it while in transit for a
12-month period. The stated purpose for the insurance was to allow
Mahboubian to ship the collection to the United States, where it would
be offered for sale. In October, Mahboubian traveled to New York where
he rented a vault at Morgan Brothers Manhattan Storage, a long-term
storage facility. According to the assistant warehouse manager,
codefendant Nedjatollah Sakhai accompanied him to Morgan Brothers. A
month later, the day after he returned from a trip to London, Sakhai too
rented a vault at Morgan Brothers, attempting unsuccessfully to get
space on the same floor as Mahboubian\'s vault.

In early December 1985, Sakhai contacted Abe Garabedian, who in turn
spoke to several men experienced in robberies and burglaries of art
storage facilities. Garabedian told them that Sakhai had \"an insurance
job\" for them. Unbeknownst to the others, one of the men --- Daniel
Cardebat --- had agreed to act as a police informant, and secretly
recorded all of their conversations with Sakhai.

When Cardebat and the others first arrived at Sakhai\'s New York City
antiques store to discuss the job, Sakhai was speaking in Farsi on the
telephone to someone in London named \[181\] Houshang about a \"job\"
that \"they will do.\" Telephone company records established that Sakhai
placed a call to Mahboubian\'s London gallery at that time. After
hanging up, Sakhai explained to them that the job involved stealing a
number of crates that would be flown from Switzerland to New York City
and that he was leaving that night to \"finalize everything with the
guy.\" They accepted his offer of \$100,000 for the theft. Three days
later, Sakhai flew to England.

A few weeks later, Mahboubian came to New York City and made
arrangements for his collection to be handled upon arrival by W.R.
Keating Company --- a customs brokerage firm --- and then stored at
Regency Worldwide Packing, a secure art packing and customs warehouse,
where customs inspection and clearance would be conducted. Mahboubian
was given a full tour of the Regency, during which he was told that his
shipment would not be stored in the open warehouse, but would be placed
inside a special steel-vaulted room. While Mahboubian was in New York,
telephone calls were made between his number and Sakhai\'s. In addition,
right before Mahboubian\'s tour of the Regency warehouse, Sakhai met
with Cardebat and Daniel Kohl, another of the hired thieves, and
informed them that the shipment would be taken from Swissair to Regency
for customs clearance, and then to Morgan Manhattan. During the meeting,
Cardebat recorded another telephone conversation in Farsi in which
Sakhai requested \"the specifications from there.\" After hanging up,
Sakhai told the others that the caller was \"him\" and that \"he\" was
\"going right now\" to \"find out where they\'re gonna be at the
Regency.\"

Mahboubian then flew to Switzerland and visited the warehouse where his
collection was stored. While there, in an unusual procedure, he marked
his initials in red on the shipping crates in which it was packed;
Sakhai had earlier told Cardebat and the others that that would be done.
The crates were shipped to New York on December 24, 1985 and transferred
to Regency the next day. Within 24 hours, two more telephone calls were
made from Sakhai\'s house to Mahboubian\'s number, and Sakhai had met
with Cardebat and the others to inform them that the marked boxes were
at the Regency. There was an unresolved discussion concerning whether
the theft would take place at the Regency or later at Morgan Manhattan.
Sakhai drew the others a diagram showing where the collection would be
stored at Morgan Manhattan in Mahboubian\'s seventh floor vault, and
told them he had \[182\] a key but preferred not to use it. The goods
were cleared by customs the next day.

Sakhai met with the thieves again at the beginning of January. This
time, he insisted that the burglary take place at the Regency,
immediately. He also told them that it would ruin the entire plan even
if one item went on the market, and that he had given his \"word of
honor that the whole thing is going to be returned to him.\" Sakhai
showed the men a diagram of the Regency\'s warehouse floor, indicating
that Mahboubian\'s crates were stored in the inner steel-vaulted room
where Mahboubian had been told they would be placed when he toured the
facility.

Two nights later, the burglary took place. Cardebat and his accomplice
knocked down a retaining wall to gain entry. Inside, Cardebat found the
room Sakhai had pointed out on his diagram and broke down its steel
doors, but could not locate the boxes. He found them a few seconds later
right outside the vault; Regency personnel had never in fact put the
boxes inside the vault. Cardebat passed the boxes out of the warehouse
to his colleagues, and the men began to remove the pieces from them. At
that point, they were arrested by members of the Manhattan Robbery Task
Force, who had been alerted by Cardebat and had observed the theft from
the beginning. Cardebat telephoned Sakhai from the precinct on the
pretext of arranging for delivery of the stolen goods, and agreed to
meet him at La Guardia Airport. Sakhai was arrested on his way there.
Mahboubian was not charged with participation in the crime until several
months later, after he had been interviewed by an Assistant District
Attorney and allegedly made a number of significant misrepresentations
about his arrangements to ship and store his collection.

This evidence in our view was sufficient for the jury to find that both
defendants had conspired, as charged, to stage a burglary and fraudulent
theft in order to collect the insurance proceeds covering Mahboubian\'s
collection. We therefore reject defendants\' claims that their
convictions for burglary, attempted grand larceny and conspiracy must be
reversed for insufficiency and the indictment dismissed.

## **\[ ... \]**

## IV.

Wholly apart from the question of severance, both defendants contend
that even if the People proved all of the allegations of the indictment,
the acts they were charged with committing did not amount to an attempt
to commit grand larceny or to a burglary. Contrary to the People\'s
argument, those contentions were preserved by defendants\' pretrial
motions to dismiss on that precise ground, even though defendants did
not specifically seek dismissal on that basis at the close of the
People\'s evidence.

With respect to the attempted grand larceny charge, defendants claim
that the scheme to steal the proceeds of Mahboubian\'s insurance policy
from Lloyd\'s not only was aborted short of fruition but also had not
yet advanced to the point where, legally, their actions constituted an
attempt. We disagree.

The substantive crime of attempt is a relatively recent development of
the common law. The modern doctrine is said to date from Lord
Mansfield\'s decision in the case of *Rex v Scofield (Cald 397) in
1784*, *and to have fully emerged in* *Rex v Higgins* (2 East 5), where,
citing *Scofield*, the court said \"\[A\]ll \[189\] such acts or
attempts as tend to the prejudice of the community, are indictable.\"
(*Id.*, at 21.) (*See generally*, Sayre, *Criminal Attempts*, 41 Harv L
Rev 821, 822-837 \[1928\].) As many commentators have noted, imposition
of punishment for an attempt poses difficult questions for a criminal
jurisprudence in which a basic premise is that bad thoughts alone do not
constitute a crime. What justification, then, is there for punishing an
attempt, when by definition the contemplated crime is not consummated?
(*See generally*, Ryu, *Contemporary Problems of Criminal Attempts*, 32
NYU L Rev 1170 \[1957\].)

Commonly given answers are that persons who engage in attempts to commit
a crime are as dangerous as those who succeed, and it would be unjust to
punish only the latter; that law enforcement agencies should be
encouraged to act before a crime is actually committed; and that
criminal attempts are in and of themselves substantively harmful to
society. Nonetheless, the right to think bad thoughts undeterred or
unpunished by the criminal law has been protected by the requirement
that in order to be punishable as an attempt, conduct must have passed
the stage of mere intent or mere preparation to commit a crime.

Defendants contend that under the law of New York demarcating the
boundary where preparation ripens into punishable attempt, their conduct
had not gone far enough to subject them to liability for an attempt to
commit grand larceny, for they had not yet reported any loss to Lloyd\'s
or filed an insurance claim when police intervention put an abrupt end
to their scheme. According to defendants, their acts, including the
forced entry into Regency and the removal of Mahboubian\'s collection,
must be characterized as mere preparation for the larceny, and while
perhaps punishable in themselves, may not be punished as an attempt to
commit a crime that would not be complete until they had taken
additional steps. In essence, the argument made by defendants is that
their actions failed to reach the level of an attempt in two related
respects, either compelling reversal: (1) several steps, requiring time,
remained to be taken; and (2) defendants could still have changed their
minds and abandoned the scheme after the warehouse break-in. The cases
do not support defendants\' contention.

The definition of a criminal attempt is found in Penal Law § 110.00: \"A
person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to
commit a crime, he engages in conduct \[190\] which tends to effect the
commission of such crime.\" On its face, the statute would appear
applicable to defendants\' conduct, but in *People v Di Stefano* (38
N.Y.2d 640, 652), we made clear that the revised Penal Law definition
was not intended to eliminate the preexisting requirement that an
attempt come \"\`very near to the accomplishment of the intended
crime\'\" before liability could be imposed. Thus, the precise issue
presented is whether defendants\' conduct came \"very near\" or
\"dangerously near\" completion of the larceny, as that requirement has
been interpreted (*People v Rizzo*, 246 N.Y. 334, 338). As is apparent,
the boundary where preparation ripens into punishable conduct depends
greatly on the facts of the particular case.

To be sure, the strictest possible approach to defining an attempt would
be to require that the defendants have engaged in the last proximate act
necessary to accomplish the intended crime. It is settled, however, that
the defendants\' act \"need not be \`the final one towards the
completion of the offense\'\". (*People v Bracey*, 41 N.Y.2d 296, 300,
citing *People v Sullivan*, 173 N.Y. 122,
133.)[^\[2\]^](#X99edbbf4568250c5ac28cb857be88387c39b60a) Thus, the fact
that defendants had not yet taken the final step necessary to obtain the
insurance money does not mean that the steps they had taken could not
constitute an attempt to do so. Similarly, the theoretical possibility
that defendants might yet have renounced the criminal venture does not
obviate their liability for an attempt, for that is true of any attempt
interrupted by the police. *People v Sullivan* (*supra*) and *People v
Collins* (234 N.Y. 355) stand for the very different proposition that a
defendant who has in fact abandoned the criminal plan may not be liable
for an attempt (*see also*, Penal Law § 40.10). Here, however, there was
no evidence that defendants had or would have voluntarily abandoned
their scheme.

The necessity of further steps for completion of the crime and the
possibility of abandonment or renunciation are factors to be considered
in evaluating whether conduct has come \[191\] \"dangerously close\" to
success, but are not dispositive. Those factors do not call for reversal
in this case.

Where the boundary line between preparation and attempt should be placed
differs with different crimes (*People v Werblow*, 241 N.Y. 55, 61).
Here, it is significant that defendants\' conduct went far beyond mere
discussion of a crime (*People v Di Stefano*, 38 N.Y.2d 640, *supra*),
and beyond agreement to commit a crime (*People v Warren*, 66 N.Y.2d
831), and even beyond arming themselves in preparation for a crime
(*People v Rizzo*, 246 N.Y. 334, *supra*). Defendants hired professional
burglars, provided them with tools, and caused them to break into a
warehouse and steal property in the dead of night. These acts
encompassed the most hazardous and difficult portion of their criminal
scheme. What remained to be done was reporting of the supposed theft to
the insurer.

Defendants\' conduct had plainly \"pass\[ed\] that point where most men,
holding such an intention as defendant holds, would think better of
their conduct and desist.\" (Skilton, *The Requisite Act in a Criminal
Attempt*, 3 U Pitt L Rev 308, 309-310 \[1937\].) Defendants\' actions in
causing the nighttime break-in were potentially and immediately
dangerous --- a factor we weigh in considering whether they were
\"dangerously close\" to the completed crime. Their activities had
reached the point where police intervention was called for, lest the
burglars escape or the collection disappear. Most important,
defendants\' acts \"had gone to the extent of placing it in their power
to commit the offense unless interrupted\". (*People v Sobieskoda*, 235
N.Y. 411, 419.)

We need not (and do not) adopt the Model Penal Code\'s definition of an
attempt as a \"substantial step\" toward completion of the crime (*see*,
ALI Model Penal Code § 5.01) in order to conclude that some acts ---
even if preparatory in a dictionary sense --- go sufficiently beyond
\"mere preparation\" as to be properly characterized as an attempt for
which criminal liability may be imposed. Thus, for instance, in *People
v Sobieskoda* (*supra*) the defendants shot their intended victim\'s
brother, but fled before even firing at the target himself who remained
some distance away. We held that the jury could find that their actions
constituted an attempted murder of the target, because they had put it
in the defendants\' power to commit the intended murder, if not
interrupted. Under the analysis proposed by the dissent, on those facts
there would be no attempt because (1) several contingencies remained
before \[192\] effectuation of the crime; (2) the defendants could have
changed their minds before doing any of those things; and (3) firing at
the target\'s brother was not an act that would have \"naturally
effect\[ed\] th\[e intended\] result\" (*see*, dissenting opn, at 198).
Indeed, we have explicitly recognized that there comes a point where it
is \"too late in the *stage of preparation* for the law to conclude that
no attempt occurred.\" (*People v Mirenda*, 23 N.Y.2d 439, 446
\[emphasis added\].)

Perhaps the real source of our disagreement with the dissent lies in the
fact that defendants had planned a complex crime that necessarily had to
proceed in several stages removed in time and space from one another.
Thus, the fact pattern here is rather different from more typical
attempts, where the would-be robber or burglar is apprehended on the
premises, tools of the trade in hand. Simpler crimes proceed directly
from preparation to completion, but defendants\' scheme by its very
nature involved a longer route.

Nevertheless, the principle remains the same: had defendants\' acts
reached the stage where they were very near or dangerously near
completion of the larceny? Unlike a burglar or robber on the premises,
defendants may not have been physically within striking distance of
success, yet in all but the most literal sense, they were. The steps
they had already taken were more than substantial: they had secured
insurance, arranged for shipment of the goods from Europe and storage in
a particular New York City warehouse, and hired thieves who actually
broke in and removed the goods. These steps took defendants to the point
where only a few comparatively minor acts --- all wholly within
defendants\' own power --- remained to be accomplished.

In the circumstances of this crime and this case, we therefore conclude
that defendants\' conduct went sufficiently beyond mere preparation and,
as the jury found, constituted attempted grand larceny.

## **\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, as to each defendant the Appellate Division order should be
reversed and a new trial ordered in accordance with this opinion. In
view of this disposition, it is unnecessary for us to consider
defendants\' remaining contentions.

TITONE, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

I agree with my colleagues that the trial court\'s refusal to grant a
severance constituted an abuse of discretion requiring reversal and a
new trial. However, I would go further and hold that the facts presented
were not legally sufficient to establish the crime of attempted grand
larceny. In my view, upholding an attempt prosecution on these facts
requires a drastic departure from our prior case law and, in effect,
makes our State\'s law virtually indistinguishable from the law of those
jurisdictions that have adopted the Model Penal Code. Such a dilution in
our State\'s requirements for establishing an attempt cannot be
justified in light of our strong recent statements in *People v Di
Stefano* (38 N.Y.2d 640) and *People v Warren* (66 N.Y.2d 831) that the
drafters of our Penal Law intended to adhere to the more demanding test
established in *People v Rizzo* (246 N.Y. 334). Accordingly, I dissent
from the majority\'s ruling to the extent that it permits a retrial on
the attempted grand larceny
counts.[^\[5\]^](#Xc2fc16858fbcf42b0d4624066db4a1347e8038f)

## \[195\] I. The Legal Standard

To establish an attempt, the prosecution must prove both the requisite
intent to commit a specific object crime and an act \"which tends to
effect the commission of such crime\" (Penal Law § 110.00). The standard
for determining whether a particular act rose to the level of an attempt
is well settled. \"The act need not be \`the final one towards the
completion of the offense\' \* \* \* but it must \`carry the project
forward within dangerous proximity to the criminal end to be
attained\'\" (*People v Bracey*, 41 N.Y.2d 296, 300; *see, e.g.*,
*People v Sobieskoda*, 235 N.Y. 411; *People v Werblow*, 241 N.Y. 55;
*People v Collins*, 234 N.Y. 355). The requirement of \"dangerous
proximity\" means that \"\[t\]he act or acts must come or advance *very
near* to the accomplishment of the intended crime\" (*People v Rizzo*,
246 N.Y. 334, 337, *supra* \[emphasis supplied\]).

In contrast, the drafters of the Model Penal Code have formulated the
standard for attempts in terms of taking a \"substantial step\" toward
the completion of the crime. Their purpose in doing so was to \"shift
the emphasis from what remains to be done --- the chief concern of the
proximity tests --- to what the actor *has already done\"* (ALI Model
Penal Code § 5.01, Tent Draft No. 10, comments, at 47 \[emphasis in
original\]). The underlying goal was to \"broaden the scope of attempt
liability\" by permitting prosecution where \"the steps already
undertaken are substantial\", notwithstanding that \"major steps must be
taken before the crime can be completed\" *(id.)*. However, as we have
very recently reaffirmed, New York has not adopted the Model Penal Code
drafters\' approach, but has instead elected to adhere to the proximity
analysis articulated in *People v Rizzo* (246 N.Y. 334, 337, *supra*)
and its predecessors (*People v Warren*, 66 N.Y.2d 831, 833, *supra*;
*accord*, *People v Di Stefano*, 38 N.Y.2d 640, 652, *supra*). Thus, the
focus on the actor\'s proximity to the completion of the object crime is
not merely archaic verbiage. To the contrary, it represents the current
state of the law in New York.

Although, as the majority notes, the proper application of the proximity
analysis is very much dependent on the facts of the particular case and
the manner in which the intended crime is to be carried out, some
general principles may be \[196\] discerned. The cases have repeatedly
stated, for example, that \"dangerous proximity to the criminal end\"
exists when the defendant\'s acts have set in motion a chain of events
that are likely to lead to the completion of the crime unless some
external force intervenes. Thus, the court stated in *Rizzo* that
\"\[t\]he law \* \* \* considers those acts only as tending to the
commission of the crime which are so near to its accomplishment that in
all reasonable probability the crime itself would have been committed
but for timely interference\" (246 NY, at 337). In another formulation,
the court indicated that an attempt could not be found where \"\[t\]he
force set in motion is neither continuous nor mechanical, and its
operation may be broken before the stage of attempt has been attained by
the withdrawal or repentance of the guilty intermediary\" (*People v
Werblow*, 241 N.Y. 55, 65, *supra*). To the same effect are *People v
Mills* (178 N.Y. 274, 285 \[act \"must be such as would naturally effect
that (criminal) result, unless prevented by some extraneous cause\"\]),
*People v Collins* (234 N.Y. 355, 359-360, *supra* \[same\]), *People v
Sullivan* (173 N.Y. 122, 135 \[attempt may be found where defendants\'
acts would have effected object crime \"had their design not been
frustrated by the presence or interference of (a third party)\"\]), and
*People v Sobieskoda* (235 N.Y. 411, 419, *supra* \[act constituted
attempt if it had \"gone to the extent of placing it in (defendants\')
power to commit offense unless interrupted, and nothing but such
interruption prevented the present commission of the offense\"\]; *see
generally*, Annotation, *Attempts to Commit Offenses of Larceny by
Trick, Confidence Game, False Pretenses, and the Like*, 6 ALR3d 241,
246, § 2 \[a\]). Other factors that have been considered are the
temporal and geographic proximity between the act and the object crime,
the existence of \"several contingencies\" standing between the act and
the object crime (*see, e.g.*, *People v Warren*, *supra*, at 833) and
the remoteness or immediacy of the act in relation to that crime
(*People v Rizzo*, *supra*, at 337). Finally, the courts have often
relied on the distinction between acts of \"mere preparation\" and those
tending to effect commission of the crime (*see, e.g.*, *People v
Bracey*, *supra*, at 300; *People v Collins*, *supra*, at 359-361). The
concept of \"mere preparation\" has been persuasively defined by other
courts as \"the devising or arranging the means or measures necessary
for the commission of the offense\" (*e.g.*, *People v Von Hecht*, 133
Cal App 2d 25, 38, 283 P2d 764, 773; *People v Murray*, 14 Cal 159;
*State v Pollard*, 215 La 655, 41 So 2d 465; *State v Block*, 333 Mo
127, 62 SW2d 428; *see*, \[197\] Annotation, *op. cit.*, 6 ALR3d, at
246). Moreover, our own court has indicated that to be guilty of an
attempt, the accused must have both acquired the wherewithal to commit
the object crime and made some direct movement toward the ultimate
object (*People v Collins*, *supra*, at 360; *People v Sullivan*,
*supra*, at 135-136). Absent the latter step, the accused is guilty of
no more than \"mere preparation.\"

The application of these standards to the fact patterns in prior cases
is instructive. In *People v Sullivan* (173 N.Y. 122, *supra*), for
example, the court upheld a conviction for murder committed in the
course of an attempted burglary, but noted that an attempt might not be
found where defendants had merely procured tools for the break-in.
Further, the court declined to find an attempted larceny in *People v
Werblow* (241 N.Y. 55, *supra*), where the defendants had only planned
the crime and sent and received cablegrams in furtherance of the scheme.
In *People v Rizzo* (246 N.Y. 334, *supra*), the defendants had armed
themselves, set out in car looking for individual who they knew was
carrying payroll money, and stopped at sites where the messenger was
expected, but were intercepted by police before they actually
encountered the messenger. Despite all of these concrete steps toward
the commission of the crime, this court held them insufficient to
constitute the crime of attempted robbery because the defendants never
came dangerously close to the completion of the object crime (*see
also*, *People v Di Stefano*, 38 N.Y.2d 640, *modfg* 45 AD2d 56, *supra*
\[same result on similar facts\]). Finally, in a very recent decision,
*People v Warren* (66 N.Y.2d 831, *supra*), we held that an attempted
drug-possession prosecution did not lie where the defendants had held
two meetings with the police informant, had reached agreement regarding
the terms of the sale, and had set up a third meeting for a later time
\"in a distant parking lot\" before they were intercepted by officers
who had been secretly watching. In reversing the conviction, we held
that the defendants had not come \"very near to the accomplishment of
the intended crime\" (66 NY2d, at 833), since the planned purchase was
to take place several hours later at a distant location and several
additional steps needed to be taken before the transaction could be
consummated.

## II. Analysis

As is evident from the foregoing, the set of facts presented here is
unlike any other in which a conviction for attempt has \[198\] been
upheld.[^\[6\]^](#X0256a7a58566909e8503e50b3296758112d032a) Defendants
Mahboubian and Sakhai were charged with attempting to commit larceny by
obtaining insurance proceeds under false pretenses. The act which formed
the basis for this charge was the abortive staged theft of Mahboubian\'s
collection from the Regency warehouse. However, this act constituted no
more than \"mere preparation\" analogous to the gathering of equipment
for a burglary or the obtaining of weapons for the effectuation of a
planned robbery. In other words, by staging the warehouse break-in and
theft, defendants were, in effect, merely laying the foundation for the
crime they planned ultimately to commit: defrauding Lloyd\'s of London.
They had not yet taken \"a step in the *direct* movement towards
th\[at\] crime\", as the case law requires (*People v Collins*, *supra*,
at 360 \[emphasis supplied\]; *see*, *People v Sullivan*, *supra*).
Further, the \"dangerous proximity\" test outlined in *People v Rizzo*
(*supra*) is unsatisfied because (1) the act on which the People relied,
the warehouse break-in, was remote, both in time and place, from the
ultimate goal (*see*, *People v Warren*, *supra*; *People v Rizzo*,
*supra*, at 337); (2) there remained \"several contingencies\" standing
between the act and the effectuation of the crime (*see*, *People v
Warren*, *supra*); (3) even after the break-in, defendants still had
complete freedom of action and could therefore have easily changed their
minds before taking the next step toward their goal; and (4) the act was
simply not \"such as would naturally effect th\[e intended\] result
\[i.e., the wrongful obtaining of insurance money\], unless prevented by
some extraneous \[199\] cause\" (*People v Mills*, *supra*, at 285;
*see, e.g.*, *People v Rizzo*, *supra*, at 337).

The majority\'s contrary conclusion seems to ignore these factors,
particularly the last. Although the majority stresses, quite correctly,
that the last act before interruption need not be the final step toward
completion of the crime, the majority fails to address that the last act
before interruption here, the break-in, did not even begin to set in
motion the chain of events that would inevitably have led to
defendants\' fraudulent acquisition of the insurance proceeds if law
enforcement authorities had not intervened. To the contrary, far more
was required, including the safe disposition of the purportedly stolen
goods, the collection of documents to establish the ownership and value
of those goods, the filing of a loss claim with the insurance company
and, finally, the successful avoidance of detection through the
investigation that the insurer would unquestionably have undertaken.
Hence, notwithstanding the majority\'s assertion to the contrary
(majority opn, at 191, quoting *People v Sobieskoda*, 235 N.Y. 411, 419,
*supra*), defendants\' acts had not \"\`gone to the extent of placing it
in their power to commit the offense unless interrupted,\'\" except in
the sense that *any* step taken in the direction of their goal would
have increased the likelihood of its
accomplishment.[^\[7\]^](#X47ac67f8ba16f1eef7e451779892e296e649c30)

Further, the facts on which the majority relies --- that defendants\'
completed acts \"encompassed the most hazardous and difficult portion of
their criminal scheme\" and that the night-time break-in was itself
\"potentially and immediately dangerous\" (majority opn, at 191) ---
are, in fact, irrelevant in establishing \[200\] \"dangerous proximity\"
to the object crime. At best, these circumstances support the premise
that the steps taken toward the completion of the crime were indeed
\"substantial.\" However, as noted above, the New York view of attempt,
in contrast to the Model Penal Code view, does not accept the
substantiality of the steps actually taken as the dispositive criterion.
Instead, the analysis must focus on the relationship between the already
completed acts and the object crime.

Finally, the weight that the majority places on the fact that
defendants\' \"activities had reached the point where police
intervention was called for, lest the burglars escape or the collection
disappear\" (*id.*, at 191) is puzzling. While that observation would
undoubtedly be helpful if the defendants had been charged with attempted
theft of the art collection, its relevance in this context, where the
ultimate object of the charged attempt crime was the theft of insurance
proceeds through fraud, is difficult to discern.

In sum, by upholding an attempt prosecution in these circumstances, the
court has significantly diluted the well-established requirements for
proving an act rising to the level of an attempt. Moreover, by blurring
the important distinction between a \"substantial step\" toward the
completion of the object crime and an act \"tend\[ing\] to effect
commission of such crime\" (Penal Law § 110.00), the court has brought
the law of New York a giant step closer to the less stringent analysis
adopted in the Model Penal Code, an analysis which our Legislature has
deliberately rejected.

For all of these reasons, I cannot join in the majority\'s decision to
permit a retrial on the attempted grand larceny counts. Accordingly, I
dissent on this aspect of the majority\'s holding.

In each case: Order reversed, etc.

State v. Gladstone

 

### *State v. Gladstone*

Supreme Court of Washington

474 P.2d 274 (Wash. 1970)

 

ALE, J.

A jury found defendant Bruce Gladstone guilty of aiding and abetting one
Robert Kent in the unlawful sale of marijuana. Deferring imposition of
sentence, the court placed defendant on probation. He appeals the order
deferring sentencing contending that the evidence as a matter of law was
insufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. His point, we think, is
well taken.

One who aids or abets another in the commission of a crime is guilty as
a principal under RCW 9.01.030, which says:

Every person concerned in the commission of a felony, gross misdemeanor
or misdemeanor, whether he directly commits the act constituting the
offense, or aids or abets in its commission, and whether present or
absent; and every person who directly or indirectly counsels,
encourages, hires, commands, induces or otherwise procures another to
commit a felony, gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor, is a principal, and
shall be proceeded against and punished as such. The fact that the
person aided, abetted, counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced
or procured, could not or did not entertain a criminal intent, shall not
be a defense to any person aiding, abetting, counseling, encouraging,
hiring, commanding, inducing or procuring him.

Gladstone\'s guilt as an aider and abettor in this case rests solely on
evidence of a conversation between him and one Douglas MacArthur
Thompson concerning the possible purchase of marijuana from one Robert
Kent. There is no other evidence to connect the accused with Kent who
ultimately sold some marijuana to Thompson.

When asked by Thompson an agent of the police where marijuana could be
bought, the defendant did no more than name Kent as an individual who
might be willing to sell some and draw a sketch of his location. There
was no evidence whatever that the defendant had any association,
understanding, agreement or arrangement, direct or indirect, tacit or
express with Kent to aid or persuade him in any way in the sale of
marijuana.

The conversation between defendant and Thompson occurred at defendant\'s
residence. Douglas MacArthur Thompson, a 25-year-old student at the
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma and an employee of the Internal
Revenue Service of the United States, had done some investigative work
for the government. From time to time, the Tacoma Police Department
engaged him to investigate the use, possession and sale of narcotics,
principally marijuana, among college students. When working for the
Tacoma Police Department, he operated under the control and direction of
the department\'s narcotics detail.

Thompson testified that Lieutenant Seymour and Detective Gallwas of the
narcotics detail asked him to attempt purchase of marijuana from
Gladstone. During the evening of April 10, 1967 between 10 and 11
o\'clock the two officers and Thompson drove in a police car to the
vicinity of defendant\'s apartment. Thompson went to Gladstone\'s door
alone, beyond the hearing and out of the sight of the two officers. He
knocked at the door and Gladstone responded. Thompson asked Gladstone if
he would sell him some marijuana. Describing this incident, Thompson
testified as follows:

Well, I asked at the time Gladstone told me that he was he did not have
enough marijuana on hand to sell me any, but he did know an individual
who had quite a sufficient quantity and that was very willing to sell
and he named the individual as Robert Kent, or Bob Kent as he put it,
and he gave me directions to the residence and he due to the directions
I asked him if, you know, if he could draw me a map and he did.

When Thompson said he asked Gladstone to draw the map for him, he added,
\"I\'m not sure whether he did give me the exact address or not, he told
me where the residence was.\" He said that Gladstone then with pencil
and paper sketched the location of Kent\'s place of residence. Thompson
had no prior knowledge of where Kent lived, and did not know if he might
have marijuana or that he had ever possessed it.

The two officers then took Thompson to Kent\'s residence where marijuana
was purchased. The actual purchase was made by Thompson directly from
Kent while Officer Gallwas and Lieutenant Seymour stayed in the police
car. Kent was subsequently arrested and convicted of selling Thompson
approximately 8 ounces of marijuana the very sale which defendant here
was convicted of aiding and abetting.

That ended the prosecution\'s case. Even if it were accorded all
favorable inferences, there appears at this point a gap in the evidence
which we feel as a matter of law is fatal to the prosecution\'s cause.
Neither on direct examination nor under cross-examination did Thompson
testify that he knew of any prior conduct, arrangements or
communications between Gladstone and Kent from which it could be even
remotely inferred that the defendant had any understanding, agreement,
purpose, intention or design to participate or engage in or aid or abet
any sale of marijuana by Kent. Other than to obtain a simple map from
Gladstone and to say that Gladstone told him Kent might have some
marijuana available, Thompson did not even establish that Kent and the
defendant were acquainted with each other. Testimony of the brief
conversation and Gladstone\'s very crude drawing consisting of 8
penciled lines indicating where Kent lived constitute the whole proof of
the aiding and abetting presented.

If all reasonable inferences favorable to the state are accorded the
evidence, it does not, in our opinion, establish the commission of the
crime charged. That vital element a nexus between the accused and the
party whom he is charged with aiding and abetting in the commission of a
crime is missing. The record contains no evidence whatever that
Gladstone had any communication by word, gesture or sign, before or
after he drew the map, from which it could be inferred that he
counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced or procured Kent to
sell marijuana to Douglas Thompson as charged, or took any steps to
further the commission of the crime charged. He was not charged with
aiding and abetting Thompson in the purchase of marijuana, but with
Kent\'s sale of it.

Gladstone\'s culpability, if at all, must be brought within RCW
9.01.030, which makes a principal of one who aids and abets another in
the commission of the crime. Although an aider and abettor need not be
physically present at the commission of the crime to be held guilty as a
principal, his conviction depends on proof that he did something in
association or connection with the principal to accomplish the crime.
Learned Hand, J., we think, hit the nail squarely when, in *United
States v. Peoni*, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938), he wrote that, in
order to aid and abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that a
defendant

. . . in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he
participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he
seek by his action to make it succeed. All the words used even the most
colorless, \"abet\" carry an implication of purposive attitude towards
it. . .

There being no evidence whatever that the defendant ever communicated to
Kent the idea that he would in any way aid him in the sale of any
marijuana, or said anything to Kent to encourage or induce him or direct
him to do so, or counseled Kent in the sale of marijuana, or did
anything more than describe Kent to another person as an individual who
might sell some marijuana, or would derive any benefit, consideration or
reward from such a sale, there was no proof of an aiding and abetting,
and the conviction should, therefore, be reversed as a matter of law.

Remanded with directions to dismiss.

The People of the State of New York, Respondent,\
v.\
Ulysses Taylor, Appellant

Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Second
Department.

June 6, 1988

Thompson, J. P., Weinstein, Eiber and Harwood, JJ., concur.

Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, the indictment is
dismissed, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Nassau
County, for the purpose of entering an order in its discretion pursuant
to CPL 160.50.

The defendant was accused and now stands convicted of robbery in the
first degree for having aided and abetted two other individuals in a
gunpoint robbery which occurred at the Sun Wah Restaurant, located on
Hempstead Turnpike in Uniondale, New York. The defendant, who was
apprehended while driving the \"getaway\" vehicle, contends that the
judgment of conviction must be reversed since the prosecution failed to
establish that he intended to commit the crime or that he intended to
assist in its execution. We agree.

It is well settled that in order to hold an alleged accessory liable for
the crime committed by the principal actors, the People must establish,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the alleged accessory possessed the
mental culpability necessary to commit the crime charged, and that in
furtherance thereof, he solicited, requested, commanded, importuned or
intentionally aided the principals (*see*, Penal Law § 20.00; *People v
La Belle*, 18 N.Y.2d 405; *People v Hayes*, 117 AD2d 621, *lv denied* 68
N.Y.2d 668; *People v Capella*, 111 AD2d 179). While the prosecution
established that the defendant may have unwittingly aided the principal
actors to the extent that he \[582\] drove them away from the scene of
the crime, proof that the defendant harbored any intent to commit
robbery or that he intentionally aided in the perpetration thereof was
lacking in this case. Indeed, the evidence, when considered in the light
most favorable to the prosecution (*see*, *People v Contes*, 60 N.Y.2d
620), established nothing more than that the defendant drove the vehicle
in which the actual perpetrators were discovered and ultimately
apprehended. The defendant\'s conviction, however, cannot be premised on
the mere fact that he was present in the automobile, without further
proof that he assumed a purposeful role in the crime or that he intended
its result (*see*, *People v Cummings*, 131 AD2d 865, 867). \"Without
adequate proof of a shared intent with the principal actor\[s\] there is
no community of purpose and, therefore no basis for finding \[that the\]
defendant acted in concert with the actual \[perpetrators\]\" (*see*,
*People v McLean*, 107 AD2d 167, 169, *affd* 65 N.Y.2d 758).

The record in this case is devoid of evidence that the defendant \"knew
beforehand of, much less \[intentionally\] participated in\" the robbery
at the Sun Wah Restaurant (*see*, *People v Cummings*, *supra*, at 867).
This conclusion is buttressed, *inter alia*, by the exculpatory
testimony of Andre John, one of the perpetrators of the robbery, who
stated that the defendant knew nothing about the robbery.

In light of our determination that the indictment must be dismissed, the
defendant\'s remaining contentions need not be addressed.

OPINION OF THE COURT

Chief Judge Kaye.

Shortly before noon on December 17, 1992, Shamel Burroughs engaged in a
gun battle with Jermaine Russell and Khary Bekka on Centre Mall of the
Red Hook Housing Project in Brooklyn. During the course of the battle,
Patrick Daly, a public school principal looking for a child who had left
school, was fatally wounded by a single stray nine millimeter bullet
that struck him in the chest. Burroughs, Bekka and Russell--- defendants
on this appeal --- were all charged with second degree murder (Penal Law
§ 125.25 \[1\], \[2\]).

Two separate juries, one for Burroughs and another for Russell and
Bekka, were impanelled contemporaneously and heard the evidence
presented at trial. Although ballistics tests were inconclusive in
determining which defendant actually fired the bullet that killed Daly,
the theory of the prosecution was that each of them acted with the
mental culpability required for commission of the crime, and that each
\"intentionally aided" the defendant who fired the fatal shot (Penal Law
§ 20.00). Both juries convicted defendants of second degree, depraved
indifference murder (Penal Law § 125.25 \[2\]).[^23]

On appeal, each defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.
Because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the
prosecution, could have led a rational trier of fact to find, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that each defendant was guilty of depraved
indifference murder as charged, we affirm the order of the Appellate
Division sustaining all three convictions.

A depraved indifference murder conviction requires proof that defendant,
under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,
recklessly engaged in conduct creating a grave risk of death to another
person, and thereby caused the death of another person (Penal Law §
125.25 \[2\]). Reckless conduct requires awareness and conscious
disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will
occur or that such circumstance exists (Penal Law § 15.05 \[3\]). \"The
risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a
reasonable person would observe in the situation" *(id.).* To constitute
\"depraved indifference," conduct must be \" \'so wanton, so deficient
in a moral sense of concern, so devoid of regard of the life or lives of
others, and so blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as
that which the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes the
death of another' " *(People v Fenner,* 61 NY2d 971, 973; *see also,
People v Register,* 60 NY2d 270, *cert denied* 466 US 953).

Although defendants underscore that only one bullet killed Patrick Daly
and it is uncertain which of them fired that bullet, the prosecution was
not required to prove which defendant fired the fatal shot when the
evidence was sufficient to establish that each defendant acted with the
mental culpability required for the commission of depraved indifference
murder, and each defendant \"intentionally aided" the defendant who
fired the fatal shot (Penal Law § 20.00; *see also, People v
Brathwaite,* 63 NY2d 839, 841-842). Defendants urge, however, that the
evidence adduced at trial did not support a finding that they --- as
adversaries in a deadly gun battle --- shared the \"community of
purpose" necessary for accomplice liability *(see, People v Allah,* 71
NY2d 830). We disagree. The fact that defendants set out to injure or
kill one another does not rationally preclude a finding that they
intentionally aided each other to engage in the mutual combat that
caused Daly's death.

*People v Abbott* (84 AD2d 11) provides an apt illustration. That case
involved two defendants --- Abbott and Moon --- who were engaged in a
\"drag race" on a residential street when Abbott lost control and
smashed into another automobile, killing the driver and two passengers.
Both defendants were convicted of criminally negligent homicide, but
Moon asserted that he was not responsible for Abbott's actions and that
his conviction should be set aside. Rejecting this argument, the court
found that, although Moon did not strike the victim's car and was
Abbott's adversary in a competitive race, he intentionally participated
with Abbott in an inherently dangerous and unlawful activity and
therefore shared Abbott's culpability. Moon's \"conduct made the race
possible" in the first place, as there would not have been a race had
Moon not \"accepted Abbott's challenge" *(id.* at 15; *see also, People
v Fabian,* 154 Misc 2d 957, 962 \[although defendants were trying to
harm each other, at the same time they acted in concert to create an
explosive condition that resulted inevitably in the victims' death and
injuries\]; *Alston v State,* 339 Md 306, 320, 662 A2d 247, 254 \[there
was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that rival groups
tacitly agreed, pursuant to an \"unwritten code of macho honor," that
there would be mutual combat and that each group aided, abetted and
encouraged its adversary to engage in urban warfare\]).

In the present case, the jurors were instructed: \"If you find that the
People have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that \[defendants\] *took
up each other's challenge,* shared in the venture and unjustifiably,
voluntarily and jointly created a zone of danger, then each is
responsible for his own acts and the acts of the others \* \* \* \[and\]
it makes no difference whether it was a bullet from Mr. Bekka's gun, Mr.
Russell's gun or Mr. Burrough's gun that penetrated Mr. Daly and caused
his death" (emphasis added).

The trial evidence was sufficient to support each jury's findings in
accordance with this charge. Although Burroughs was shooting at Russell
and Bekka, and Russell and Bekka were shooting at Burroughs, there was
adequate proof to justify the finding that the three defendants tacitly
agreed to engage in the gun battle that placed the life of any innocent
bystander at grave risk and ultimately killed Daly. Indeed, unlike an
unanticipated ambush or spontaneous attack that might have taken
defendants by surprise, the gunfight in this case only began after
defendants acknowledged and accepted each others' challenge to engage in
a deadly battle on a public concourse.

As defendants approached one another on Centre Mall, a grassy open area
that serves as a thoroughfare for the 7,000 residents of the 28-building
housing complex, it was evident that an encounter between them would be
violent and would endanger others. There was trial evidence that when
Burroughs first saw Bekka and Russell walking toward him, he immediately
recognized the danger, instructing the two female friends accompanying
him, one of them pregnant, to \"run" or \"go." They too plainly sensed
the danger because, without hesitation, they turned and ran.

Despite the palpable threat, Burroughs, armed with a nine millimeter
Glock, did not flee with his friends. Rather, he continued toward
Russell and Bekka, tacitly accepting their invitation and issuing one of
his own. In turn, Russell and Bekka, also armed with automatic weapons,
continued walking toward Burroughs, challenging him and accepting his
challenge. As they drew nearer, defendants each began firing their
high-powered guns, capable of shooting bullets at an average rate of
1,100 feet per second, across the pedestrian thoroughfare. The dozen or
more people in the area, as well as those with windows overlooking the
Mall, were put at grave risk as defendants unleashed a hail of bullets.
Witnesses testified that the battle sounded \"like a war" and that
anywhere from nine to 20 shots were fired.

Although Centre Mall is surrounded by buildings affording refuge,
defendants chose instead to run through the area aggressively pursuing
one another. Indeed, even after exchanging an initial volley of shots,
they continued to wage their private war, issuing taunts and ducking
back and forth behind buildings and trees, seeking tactical advantage.
As a result of defendants' deadly gun battle, Patrick Daly was shot in
the chest and killed almost instantly.

At trial, all three defendants sought to exonerate themselves by arguing
self-defense --- each claiming that their opponent shot first and they
were justified in firing back. Under New York law, however, a person who
reasonably believes that another is about to use deadly physical force
is not free to reciprocate with \"deadly physical force if he knows that
he can with complete safety as to himself and others avoid the necessity
of so doing by retreating" (Penal Law § 35.15 \[2\] \[a\]; *People v
Goetz,* 68 NY2d 96, 106). Here, there was evidence that defendants did
not avail themselves of opportunities for safe retreat, choosing instead
to use deadly force against each other. As such, there was adequate
support for each jury's rejection of defendants' justification defense.

The evidence adduced at trial was also sufficient for the jury to
determine that all three defendants acted with the mental culpability
required for depraved indifference murder, and that they intentionally
aided and encouraged each other to create the lethal crossfire that
caused the death of Patrick Daly.

To the extent defendants' remaining arguments are preserved, we conclude
that they are without merit.

Accordingly, in each case the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed.

Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.

In each case: Order affirmed.

CIPARICK, J.

The question presented by this appeal is whether a conditional agreement
to murder a person in the future can be subject to prosecution under our
conspiracy law. In particular, we are asked to determine whether
evidence presented at defendant\'s nonjury trial was legally sufficient
to support his conviction for conspiracy in the second degree (*see*
Penal Law § 105.15). We conclude that the evidence presented was
sufficient to support the conviction and that the contingencies imposed
did not negate the existence of a conspiratorial agreement.

Defendant, while incarcerated at Rikers Island on child endangerment and
promotion of prostitution charges, confided in fellow inmate, Martin
Mitchell, who, unbeknownst to defendant, was a government informant,
that he was willing to pay \$5,000 to have the 14-year-old complaining
witness in his child endangerment case killed. Mitchell, who was nearing
release from Rikers Island, informed a New York City Police Department
(NYPD) detective of his conversation with defendant. At the detective\'s
request, Mitchell again met with defendant and told defendant that he
knew of a hit man who would kill the intended victim. During this
conversation defendant gave Mitchell a telephone number so that he could
make contact with defendant\'s associates once he was released in order
to arrange for the contract killing.

On August 23, 2002, Mitchell, who was now released from incarceration,
visited defendant at Rikers Island. Their conversation was recorded as
Mitchell was wired with a tape recorder at the request of the NYPD.
During this meeting, defendant changed the intended victim of the
contract killing from the complaining witness to a rival named
\"Seven,\" who had months earlier allegedly shot defendant in the head.
Defendant also stated that he would now pay \$4,000 to have Seven killed
and expressed optimism that he would soon be getting out of jail.

A week later, Mitchell and an undercover officer, who posed as a hit man
and was equipped with a hidden tape recorder, visited defendant at
Rikers Island. Defendant, Mitchell and the undercover discussed that the
complaining witness was to be
[568\*568](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=17118086111095717416&scilh=0#p568)
left alone and that the now intended target of the killing would be
Seven. In the presence of the undercover, Mitchell told defendant that
they would charge \$4,000 for the hit. Defendant instructed the
undercover to telephone coconspirator Crystal Rhodes to obtain
information on contacting another of defendant\'s associates named Kenny
so they could discuss the plan for killing Seven. Defendant wrote
Rhodes\'s telephone number on a piece of paper for the undercover.

As defendant instructed, the undercover called Rhodes, who provided two
telephone numbers to contact Kenny. The undercover called both numbers
and an unidentified female answered and informed him that Kenny was
unavailable. During the second call, the undercover discovered that
Kenny was currently incarcerated.

On September 9, 2002, the undercover again called Rhodes, who attempted
a three-way call with herself, defendant and the undercover, but because
of a technical difficulty the three-way call was not established. Rhodes
then relayed messages back and forth between the undercover and
defendant. The undercover advised defendant that Kenny was presently
incarcerated, at which time defendant agreed to have the undercover
visit him the following Friday at Rikers Island.

On September 13, 2002, the undercover, who was again equipped with a
tape recorder, returned to Rikers Island for another visit with
defendant. During that conversation, defendant instructed the undercover
to \"\[j\]ust hold the girl\" and, in regard to the other intended
victim, to \"wait \[until he\] g\[o\]t out \... because \[he wanted to\]
put \[his\] hands on some major money.\" The undercover inquired as to
the identity of the intended victim, and defendant replied: \"The one
that I want done \... \[is the one\] who got me set up for the shot. I
was shot right here in the head \... \[His name is\] Seven.\" Defendant
further stated that he knew that Seven lived in Manhattan, but did not
know the exact address; defendant then gave a general description of the
location of Seven\'s apartment. Defendant also described Seven as being
\"six-one, six-two, slender build, real dark \... \[n\]o gold teeth.\"
Defendant continued: \"When you \[are\] in jail, you ain\'t got
nothin\[g\] \... \`\[H\]ere, take this thousand dollars.\' I can\'t do
that in jail, there\'s no money in my pocket in jail \... all I got is
my word.\" Defendant goes on to state that: \"If I say its gonna happen,
\[you\] know, to the best of my abilities, if it didn\'t happen, it
means I got shot again or

something \... \[s\]omething to really prevent it from happening\... I
really want him
bad.\"[^\[1\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=17118086111095717416&scilh=0#%5B1%5D)

Additionally, during this visit, defendant stated that he will \"try to
keep a tab on \[Seven\]\" and the undercover stated that he will \"open
\[his\] eyes and go out lookin\[g\].\" Defendant further stated that a
woman he knows, Rabia Walker, \"runs into him every now and then\" and
that \"she could show \[the undercover\] the building\" where Seven
lives. The undercover then told defendant that he would take pictures of
individuals fitting Seven\'s description at the building where Seven
supposedly lived and show them to Walker for a positive identification.
On September 20, 2002, the undercover spoke to Rhodes by telephone.
Rhodes indicated that she was aware of the plan to have him take
pictures of individuals matching Seven\'s description and that the
pictures would be presented to Walker for identification. Rhodes then
gave the undercover Walker\'s telephone number.

On September 22, 2002, the undercover called Walker, who acknowledged
that she too knew of the plan to kill Seven and that she was to identify
Seven from pictures that he would show her. The next day, the undercover
telephoned Walker, at which time she stated that \"there\'ll be no
payments made or anything because \[defendant\] doesn\'t want anything
done until he comes home.\" Shortly thereafter, defendant was arrested
and charged with conspiracy in the second degree.

After a nonjury trial, Supreme Court decided that defendant and Mitchell
entered into an agreement to fulfill defendant\'s intention to eliminate
Seven. Supreme Court also found that \"there were overt acts sufficient
in this case as to constitute the legal prerequisite for a conspiracy in
the second degree.\" The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed,
holding that \"the agreement to kill the intended victim remained firm,
notwithstanding that defendant wanted the killing postponed \[and that\]
evidence also established numerous overt acts in furtherance of the
agreement, including steps taken to enable the hired killer to locate
and identify the intended victim\" (29 AD3d 362, 362-363 \[2006\]). A
Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we now affirm.

Defendant argues that the evidence against him was legally insufficient
to support a finding that he entered into an agreement to kill Seven
since he conditioned any action on his release from jail, he did not
enter into an agreement to have Seven killed but only found and
identified, and that there was no agreement since he and the undercover
never discussed price. The People argue that under a sufficiency
standard,[^\[2\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=17118086111095717416&scilh=0#%5B2%5D)
there was ample evidence offered at trial that proved that defendant
entered into an agreement to kill Seven, overt acts in furtherance of
that goal were committed and defendant did not place a condition on the
agreement that prevented the formation of the agreement itself to kill
Seven.

Section 105.15 of the Penal Law provides that \"\[a\] person is guilty
of conspiracy in the second degree when, with intent that conduct
constituting a class A felony be performed, he agrees with one or more
persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct.\"
Furthermore, it is well settled that \"\[a\] conspiracy consists of an
agreement to commit an underlying substantive crime \..., coupled with
an overt act committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the
conspiracy\" ([*People v Caban,* 5 NY3d 143, 149
\[2005\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4639073196176605678&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

We are here presented with the question whether conditions placed on an
agreement can negate the existence of a conspiracy. The federal circuit
courts provide some guidance in this regard since they have considered
whether a purported agreement that is conditioned by a defendant can be
considered an agreement to commit an unlawful act under conspiracy law.
The First and Eighth Circuits have adopted the approach that an
agreement with a condition will be effective only if the defendant
subjectively believes the condition is likely to be fulfilled ([*United
States v Anello,* 765 F2d 253, 262 \[1st Cir
1985\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=603471974819778467&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*United States v Brown,* 946 F2d 58, 61 \[8th Cir
1991\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7395971911819062866&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
The Appellate Division here relied upon the First Circuit\'s holding in
[*United States v Palmer* (203 F3d 55, 64 \[1st Cir
2000\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3735994876096384539&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
which followed *Anello,* where the federal court held that
\"\[l\]iability should attach if the defendant reasonably believed that
the conditions
[571\*571](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=17118086111095717416&scilh=0#p571)
would obtain.\" In *Anello,* the defendant had conditioned his purchase
of marijuana on its quality. The defendant, however, proceeded with
obtaining the funds to purchase the drugs in anticipation that his
quality concerns would be met. The court found \"that the \`quality\'
condition was unlikely to prove a serious impediment\" ([*Anello,* 765
F2d at
263](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=603471974819778467&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0))
to the formation of the agreement to purchase the marijuana, since the
defendant subjectively believed that the condition would be fulfilled
and, as such, proceeded to fulfill his obligations under the agreement.

Three other circuits take a different approach, holding that conditions
to an agreement are legally irrelevant (*see* [*United States v Grassi,*
616 F2d 1295, 1302 \[5th Cir
1980\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5234556988700381190&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*United States v Prince,* 883 F2d 953, 958 \[11th Cir
1989\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17810777916358578961&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)),
unless the conditions are so unlikely to be met that the agreement is
illusory ([*United States v Podolsky,* 798 F2d 177, 179 \[7th Cir
1986\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5319661900740446719&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
We need not go as far as this to resolve this case; even under the
*Anello, Palmer* and *Brown* test, defendant\'s conviction would be
upheld. Defendant reasonably believed the condition to the execution of
the planned murder---his release from prison---would occur.

Defendant asks us to reject all the federal cases just cited in favor of
[*United States v Melchor-Lopez* (627 F2d 886, 891 \[9th Cir
1980\]),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15969984130573206276&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
which he reads as holding that there is no legally effective agreement
if conditions are set but not fulfilled. This is a misreading of
*Melchor-Lopez,* which involved not a conditional agreement but the
absence of any agreement. In *Melchor-Lopez,* \"government agents
produced \$80,000 in an effort to induce Melchor-Lopez to bring heroin
into the United States for sale, \[but\] he steadfastly refused to agree
to any such transaction, insisting that any transfer would have to be
made in San Luis, Mexico\" ([627 F2d at
889](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15969984130573206276&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
The Ninth Circuit held that \"the evidence fell far short of showing an
agreement because \[the defendant\] firmly insisted on certain
conditions unacceptable to his would-be co-conspirators\" ([627 F2d at
891](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15969984130573206276&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
*Melchor-Lopez* thus stands for the proposition that \"conditions\"
demanded by a party which are \"unacceptable\" to the other party may
create an inability for the parties to enter into an agreement.

Here, neither party imposed a condition on entry into the agreement that
was unacceptable to the other. Similarly, we have previously held that
an \"agreement\" to murder a victim is effectuated when the
coconspirators *accept* the defendant\'s
[572\*572](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=17118086111095717416&scilh=0#p572)
invitation to kill the victim (*see* [*Caban,* 5 NY3d at
149](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4639073196176605678&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
Thus, the determinative factor is whether there was an agreement--- not
whether agreed-upon conditions made the performance of the agreement
contingent upon the happening of an event.

Here, the conditions that defendant imposed on the performance of the
agreement---to commit a murder---were that nothing was to happen to
Seven until defendant was released from jail and was able to secure
money to pay for the hit. These requirements were not \"conditions\"
negating the existence of an agreement to kill Seven---they were terms
of the agreement. In other words, defendant\'s wish to delay the killing
and payment until he was released from prison was not a demand in
negotiations that prevented the parties from reaching the agreement to
kill Seven, but a temporal component of the agreement accepted by both
parties.

A conspiratorial agreement will be found where there is a \"concrete and
unambiguous \... expression of \[defendant\'s\] intent to violate the
law\" ([*Caban,* 5 NY3d at
149,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4639073196176605678&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
quoting [*People v Schwimmer,* 66 AD2d 91,
95](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12196876993880031663&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
\[2d Dept 1978\], *affd*[47 NY2d 1004
\[1979\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14858134405853860450&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*for reasons stated below*). Both Mitchell\'s and the undercover\'s
testimony reveal that defendant entered into an agreement to commit the
underlying substantive crime of murder in the first degree, and that
there were overt acts committed in furtherance of that goal (*see*
[*Caban,* 5 NY3d at
149](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4639073196176605678&q=8+N.Y.3d+565&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).

Defendant also proposes that since the amount to be paid to the
undercover was not agreed upon there could be no conspiratorial
agreement. Clearly, there was evidence that the parties agreed upon the
price. In the initial meeting between defendant and Mitchell, defendant
mentioned a \$4,000 price, and defendant could not have doubted that
Mitchell had passed that number on to the undercover (the supposed hit
man). Moreover, at a later meeting in the presence of the undercover,
Mitchell repeated that figure to defendant as the price for the hit, and
defendant responded, \"\[y\]eah, yeah, yeah.\" Thereafter, the parties
worked out the details of the conspiracy, defendant dispatched the
undercover to locate the intended victim, and defendant coordinated with
his associates outside of prison to assist in locating and identifying
the intended victim. The evidence was therefore sufficient to support
the conclusion by the finder of fact that an agreement had been made.

Therefore, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the People
and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor as we must, we
conclude that defendant\'s conviction was supported by the evidence
presented at trial.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

Order affirmed.

### The People of the State of New York, Appellant, v. Moises Menache, Respondent

**Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
Second Department.**

December 30, 19**\[ ... \]**

***\[ ... \]***

TITONE, J.

The question before us is whether a telephonic conversation may
constitute an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy. We conclude that
it may when the conversation is an act independent of the agreement
itself and tends to carry out the object of the conspiracy. Because
these criteria are lacking here, we affirm the order of dismissal (110
Misc 2d 987).

Defendant, Moises Menache, a physician, was indicted for conspiracy in
the sixth degree (Penal Law, § 105.00). It is alleged that he agreed
with three other individuals to influence certain unnamed employees of a
medical college to accept his son for admission as a student. In pursuit
of
[336\*336](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15751960816421414142&scilh=0#p336)
the scheme, defendant allegedly paid the sum of \$5,000 to one of the
coconspirators who, in turn, was supposed to pass this money to the
employees at the medical college.

An indictment charging conspiracy is jurisdictionally defective unless
it is alleged that an overt act was committed within the Statute of
Limitations ([*Grunewald v United States*, 353 US 391,
396-397](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16164097857918570388&q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
[*People v Hines*, 284 N.Y. 93,
112-114](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=8565500025981567864&q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)).
Since conspiracy in the sixth degree is a class B misdemeanor (Penal
Law, § 105.00) the applicable Statute of Limitations is two years (CPL
30.10, subd 2, par \[c\]).

The indictment before us sets forth five overt acts, the first four of
which are clearly outside the two-year limitations period. Our concern
is only with the fifth overt act which charges that \"\[o\]n or about
and between January 1, 1979 and August 1, 1979, the defendant
communicated by telephone with \[a named coconspirator\] concerning the
progress of \[the coconspirator\'s\] efforts to secure the admission of
the defendant\'s son into the \* \* \* \[m\]edical \[c\]ollege\".

The County Court granted defendant\'s motion to dismiss the
indictment.[^\[1\]^](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15751960816421414142&scilh=0#%5B1%5D)
We now affirm.

To place the issue before us in proper focus, it should be noted that at
common law the gist of the offense of conspiracy was the unlawful
combination or agreement. No overt act was necessary to complete the
crime (see [*People v Sheldon*, 139 N.Y. 251,
265](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=3768606797466057931&q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0);
Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes \[7th ed\], § 9.00, pp 550-551). While
this remains the rule in some States, New York, as well as the Federal
Government and several sister States, have added an overt act
requirement by statute (Penal Law, § 105.20; Clark and Marshall, *op.
cit.*, pp 552-553; LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law, § 62, pp 476-477).

As observed by the Supreme Court, \"\[t\]he function of the overt act in
a conspiracy prosecution is simply to manifest \`that the conspiracy is
at work,\' \* \* \* and is neither a project still resting solely in the
minds of the conspirators

New York law appears to be in accord (see [*People v McGee*, 49 N.Y.2d

Insofar as some cases might be read as suggesting that the overt act
must be the commencement of the criminal act, or an element of the
offense which is the object of the conspiracy (see, e.g., [*People v

we agree with LaFave and Scott that they \"are incorrect for they are
inconsistent with the function of the overt act requirement \* \* \* If

virtually any act will satisfy the overt act requirement\" (LaFave and

It is thus too much of a generalization to state, in a conclusory
fashion, that \"mere talk\", without more, can never constitute an overt
act in furtherance of a conspiracy. The more apt question is the content

We have no doubt, for example, that a telephonic conversation in which
the implements of the crime are ordered
[338\*338](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&case=15751960816421414142&scilh=0#p338)
would constitute an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy (see

cut. Conversation among conspirators may merely be cementing the
agreement itself (cf. [*People v Russo*, 57 AD2d

or may be an overt act in furtherance of the agreement (see [*People v

LaFave and Scott, *op. cit.*, p 478). And, conversation which attempts
to enlist others may or may not constitute an overt act in furtherance
of the conspiracy (cf. [*People ex rel. Conte v Flood*, 53 Misc 2d 109,
110,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6885572575529176682&q=98+A.D.2d+335&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&scilh=0)
*supra*). \"The object of the statute \[requiring proof of an overt

*supra*).

The telephonic communications in this case, however, as alleged by the
People, simply involve conversations between two coconspirators. Neither
singly nor in combination do they constitute sufficiently independent
acts \"as would tend to flow from the unlawful agreement and tend to
carry out the object of the conspiracy\" ([*People v De Cabia*, *supra*,

Pinkerton v. United States

 

**\[ ... \]**

328 U.S. 640 **\[ ... \]**

PINKERTON ET AL.

v\.

UNITED STATES.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Walter and Daniel Pinkerton are brothers who live a short distance from
each other on Daniel\'s farm. They were indicted for violations of the
Internal Revenue Code. The indictment contained ten substantive counts
and one conspiracy count. The jury found Walter guilty on nine of the
substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. It found Daniel guilty
on six of the substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. **\[ ...
\]**

A single conspiracy was charged and proved. **\[ ... \]** Each of the
substantive offenses found was committed pursuant to the conspiracy.
Petitioners therefore contend that the substantive counts became merged
in the conspiracy count**\[ ... \]**. **\[ ... \]**

It has been long and consistently recognized by the Court that the
commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are
separate and distinct offenses. **\[ ... \]** A conspiracy is a
partnership in crime. *United States* v. *Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,* 310
U.S. 150, 253. It has ingredients, as well as implications, distinct
from the completion of the unlawful project. As stated in *United
States* v. *Rabinowich,* 238 U.S. 78, 88:

\"For two or more to confederate and combine together to commit or cause
to be committed a breach of the criminal laws, is an offense of the
gravest character, sometimes quite outweighing, in injury to the public,
the mere commission of the contemplated crime. It involves deliberate
plotting to subvert the laws, educating and preparing the conspirators
for further and habitual criminal practices. And it is characterized by
secrecy, rendering it difficult of detection, requiring more time for
its discovery, and adding to the importance of punishing it when
discovered.\"

**\[ ... \]**

There is, however, no evidence to show that Daniel participated directly
in the commission of the substantive offenses on which his conviction
has been sustained, [^\[5\]^](#X0b0efb7452011df32f393987c0acc3b53cc8c7a)
although there was evidence to show that these substantive offenses were
in fact committed by Walter in furtherance of the unlawful agreement or
conspiracy existing between the brothers. The question was submitted to
the jury on the theory that each petitioner could be found guilty of the
substantive offenses, if it was found at the time those offenses were
committed petitioners were parties to an unlawful conspiracy and the
substantive offenses charged were in fact committed in furtherance of
it.[*\[6\]*](#X24142ccf4d4c864f127cc881feaf1a6649e46a4)

**\[ ... \]**

 We have here a continuous conspiracy. There is here no evidence of the
affirmative action on the part of Daniel which is necessary to establish
his withdrawal from it. *Hyde* v. *United States,* 225 U.S. 347, 369. As
stated in that case, \"Having joined in an unlawful scheme, **\[ ...
\]** until he does some act to disavow or defeat the purpose he is in no
situation to claim the delay of the law. As the offense has not been
terminated or accomplished he is still offending. **\[ ... \]**And so
long as the partnership in crime continues, the partners act for each
other in carrying it forward. **\[ ... \]**A scheme to use the mails to
defraud, which is joined in by more than one person, is a conspiracy.
*Cochran* v. *United States,* 41 F.2d 193, 199-200. Yet all members are
responsible, though only one did the mailing. *Cochran* v. *United
States, supra;* *Mackett* v. *United States,* 90 F.2d 462, 464; *Baker*
v. *United States,* 115 F.2d 533, 540; *Blue* v. *United States,* 138
F.2d 351, 359. The governing principle is the same when the substantive
offense is committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the
unlawful project. *Johnson* v. *United States,* 62 F.2d 32, 34. The
criminal intent to do the act is established by the formation of the
conspiracy. Each conspirator instigated the commission of the crime. The
unlawful agreement contemplated precisely what was done. It was formed
for the purpose. The act done was in execution of the enterprise. The
**\[ ... \]** act of one partner in crime is attributable to all. **\[
... \]** \[W\]e fail to see why **\[ ... \]** acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy are likewise not attributable to the others for the purpose
of holding them responsible for the substantive offense.

A different case would arise if the substantive offense committed by one
of the conspirators was not in fact done in furtherance of the
conspiracy, did not fall within the scope of the unlawful project, or
was merely a part of the ramifications of the plan which could not be
reasonably foreseen as a necessary or natural consequence of the
unlawful agreement. But as we read this record, that is not this case.

*Affirmed.*

**\[ ... \]**

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, dissenting in part.

The judgment concerning Daniel Pinkerton should be reversed. In my
opinion it is without precedent here and is a dangerous precedent to
establish.

Daniel and Walter, who were brothers living near each other, were
charged in several counts with substantive offenses**\[ ... \]**. The
proof showed that Walter alone committed the substantive crimes. There
was none to establish that Daniel participated in them, aided and
abetted Walter in committing them, or knew that he had done so. Daniel
in fact was in the penitentiary, under sentence for other crimes, when
some of Walter\'s crimes were done.

**\[ ... \]**

I think this ruling violates**\[ ... \]** convicts one man for
another\'s crime **\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]**

\[T\]he almost unlimited scope of vicarious responsibility for others\'
acts which follows once agreement is shown, the psychological advantages
of such trials for securing convictions by attributing to one proof
against another, these and other inducements require that the broad
limits of discretion allowed to prosecuting officers in relation to such
charges and trials be not expanded into new, wider and more dubious
areas of choice. **\[ ... \]**

Daniel has been held guilty of the substantive crimes committed only by
Walter on proof that he did no more than conspire with him to commit
offenses of the same general character. There was no evidence that he
counseled, advised or had knowledge of those particular acts or
offenses. There was, therefore, none that he aided, abetted or took part
in them. There was only evidence sufficient to show that he had agreed
with Walter at some past time to engage in such transactions generally.
As to Daniel this was only evidence of conspiracy, not of substantive
crime.

The Court\'s theory seems to be that Daniel and Walter became general
partners in crime by virtue of their agreement and because of that
agreement without more on his part Daniel became criminally responsible
as a principal for everything Walter did thereafter in the nature of a
criminal offense of the general sort the agreement contemplated, so long
as there was not clear evidence that Daniel had withdrawn from or
revoked the agreement. Whether or not his commitment to the penitentiary
had that effect, the result is a vicarious criminal responsibility as
broad as, or broader than, the vicarious civil liability of a partner
for acts done by a co-partner in the course of the firm\'s business.

Such analogies from private commercial law and the law of torts are
dangerous, in my judgment, for transfer to the criminal field. See Sen.
Rep. No. 163, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 20. Guilt there with us remains
personal, not vicarious, for the more serious offenses. It should be
kept so. **\[ ... \]**Without the agreement Daniel was guilty of no
crime on this record. With it and no more, so far as his own conduct is
concerned, he was guilty of two.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

[**\[ ... \]**](#X04e19203959578aac5c1854c77ac1d8ed4ec6b5)

[\[5\]](#Xd138d72d5a63804c74ee4b4001b4352c5dd44f9) This question does
not arise as to Walter. He was the direct actor in some of the
substantive offenses on which his conviction rests. So the general
sentence and fine are supportable under any one of those. See note 1,
*supra.*

Bernick on \"Enslavers\' conspiracy\"

 

The following is an excerpt from Evan Bernick, \"Abolish Conspiracy\"
(2024), available at
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4906026.

 

*Enslavers' Conspiracy*

In his pathbreaking history of slave revolts in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, Jason Sharples documents how elites throughout the
Atlantic world lived in perpetual fear of plans by enslaved people to
secure their freedom. Some of this fear was attributable to large-scale
violent uprisings, like the Haitian Revolution. But there emerged local
sources of fear as well, and local disputes between White elites about
how best to prevent uprisings in their own communities. Would it be more
effective to increase supervision of enslaved people and thus make it
easier to discover developing plots? Or instead to allow enslaved and
freed people to gather with little supervision, thus mitigating racial
antagonism?

Sharples finds that testimonies and confessions regarding slave
conspiracies in British America were remarkably homogenous. The alleged
plots involved general slaughter of White men and rape of White
women---precisely what enslavers most feared.Investigators used torture
to elicit testimonies and confessions that mapped on well to preexisting
White fears.Enslavers then brutally executed alleged plotters,
terrifying a subject population into further confessions that began the
cycle all over again.*\[Bernick is referring to this book: Jason
Sharples, The World That Fear Made: Slave Revolts and Conspiracy Scares
in Early America (2020).\]*

This system encouraged misunderstanding, manipulation, and false
incrimination. Suspects could be spared from death by incriminating
others, and found that they could do so most persuasively to their
interrogators by describing conspiracies of great scope and scale. To
avoid violence to their families and friends, they accused acquaintances
and enemies. To avoid suspicion, they avoided social gatherings, lest
their speech and actions be taken to evince unlawful agreements.

We find in antebellum conspiracy as well a relaxation of evidentiary
rules to make it easier to produce convictions. Through the 1720s
enslaved people were generally excluded from courts, except in
noncapital cases.It was to aid the prosecution of slave conspiracies
that enslaving states admitted testimony by enslaved people in the first
place, and they did so often in violation of normal common-law
rules.Again, the testimony was often produced by torture---and the
common law didn't permit torture.Thus, rules of evidence were bent
specifically for slave conspiracies. 

Of course, there *did* exist conspiracies against slavery. In spring
1800 Gabriel Prosser organized a general uprising involving enslaved
artisans, resident aliens, and non-Black workers.Louisiana was the site
of a major slave revolt in 1811 that involved about 500 insurgents.Nat
Turner instilled panic and terror throughout enslaving states when in
1831 he and his coconspirators killed fifty-five adults and children of
the planter class.Maroon communities offered refuge to runaway African
and Black slaves and inspiration and material support for nearby slave
revolts.Most famously, from 1830 to the Civil War the Underground
Railroad conspired to transport an estimated 66,000 enslaved people to
freedom.

You might be wondering at this point whether the evils of antebellum
conspiracy criminalization are relevant to contemporary conspiracy.
Perhaps you're appalled by the investigation, prosecution, and
punishment of conspiracy by enslaved people and their allies because
you're appalled by slavery and torture. Maybe you're not appalled by the
use of surveillance and snitching to discover and thwart agreements to
commit crimes.

But I want you to consider the possibility that certain of the ways in
which antebellum conspiracy brutalized and fragmented racialized
communities are a function of conspiracy itself. That the detection of
unlawful agreements will always require surveillance, depend upon
informants, and chill social activities in which racialized communities
engage. That the possibility of misunderstandings attributable to
cultural differences and racial stereotypes will always be present. And
that the legacy of rightful conspiracies against laws enacted by
conspiring elites continues to shape perceptions of conspiracy
criminalization. I'll explore this possibility soon.

Priscilla Grim, How to Survive Jail

 

excerpt from Priscilla Grim, How to Survive Jail (Hammer and Hope
2014) - full article (with pictures) and guide is here:
https://hammerandhope.org/article/jail-cop-city-forest-defender

 

On March 5, 2023,** **23 people, including me, were arrested and charged
with domestic terrorism.** **It happened on my second day in the
encampment in Atlanta's Weelaunee (South River) Forest** **that I had
joined to report on the protests** **against the building of a
militarized police training facility known as Cop City. I am now one of
61 people threatened with up to 20 years in state prison in** **[one of
the largest state-level racketeering indictments in the history of the
United
States](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/21/1200898062/rico-case-against-cop-city-protesters-in-atlanta-stirs-concerns-about-free-speec).

After my arrest, I was held in pretrial detention at DeKalb County Jail
for 31 days without a bond, an indictment, or a hearing.** **Though I
still have not been indicted on the domestic terrorism charge, whether I
eventually will be could remain an outstanding question for the next few
years. An additional 41 Cop City activists face domestic terrorism
charges, though only a handful have been indicted so far. My indictment
and arraignment on a racketeering charge months later put me in Fulton
County Jail for 27 hours. Both jails in Atlanta were terrifying in their
own ways.

Though I had been arrested before, I had never been given a significant
charge or spent extended time in jail until I arrived in Atlanta.** **A
former Atlanta resident, I had become curious about the Stop Cop City
movement when I read about the City Council deciding to [ignore the
wishes of the
people](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/17-hours-of-public-comment-pour-in-ahead-of-police-training-center-vote/RDE6OHCQRRCZXPQFHFS776CX2I/) and
move forward with building the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center,
a.k.a. Cop City, pushed by one of the [largest and most well-funded
police foundations in the United
States](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/among-us-police-foundations-atlanta-is-an-outlier/QKI6RLHDUBC6TKEDHDITL53CIY/).** **After
learning about the murder of Tortuguita, an activist with the Stop Cop
City movement who was shot by Georgia state troopers over 50 times, I
decided to fly down and document the movement's efforts on [my
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18058716118423058/).** **As
a street and media activist since the 1990s, I understood how [the
punishment of activists at the behest of
corporations](https://www.google.com/search?q=corporations+activists+arrests&oq=corporations+activists+arrests&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQLhhA0gEINTU2N2owajSoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#ip=1) had
intensified since I participated in the 2011 encampment of Occupy Wall
Street in New York City.

...

People use the terms "prison" and "jail" interchangeably, but prison is
where a sentence of longer than a year is served after conviction for a
"serious crime" --- [jails are very different and often much
worse](https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2022/03/28/hed-what-i-learned-from-being-sent-to-county-jail/ideas/essay/) because
people are meant to move through and out of them quickly.** **Jails
often lack outdoor recreation, and many of the programs, such as
libraries, found in the long-term carceral environment of prison.

I hope this guide never becomes relevant to you. But if it does, I want
to see you survive the pretrial incarceration experience of jail. You
could be placed there for a few hours, a few days, a few weeks, or [even
a few
years](https://www.socialpolicylab.org/mass-incarceration)** **without a
charge, without hope, and in psychological freefall. You must survive.

***Be patient.***

When you are arrested, [if you survive your initial contact with
police](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/us-police-killings-record-number-2022),
you will be handcuffed. The handcuffs will be very tight, and your body
will be twisted painfully. Telling police how they are hurting you will
probably not influence how they treat you; still,** **attorney [Mo
Meltzer-Cohen](https://moatlaw.com/about-mo/)** **advises that you must
do it anyway. Asserting your constitutional rights --- in this case, the
right to be free from excessive force or the right to have your pressing
medical needs addressed --- does not in itself function to constrain or
influence the behavior of the police. What it does is enable your
attorney to make certain kinds of arguments on your behalf. Suppose you
do not tell the police you are being hurt. In that case, it will be
impossible to argue later that they were deliberately indifferent to
your serious medical needs or used excessive force against you in a way
that violated the Constitution.

In the meantime, patiently waiting is most effective. Breathe deeply if
you can. Find a happy memory and let it fill your mind. Shift your body
as you can to find comfort. When you feel it is safe not to be fully
present, rest your mind inside memory or fantasy.

Notice the people coming out of the jail as you go in. They once stood
in your place and are now out. You must believe you, too, will survive
and leave incarceration. Believing you will is part of the battle. Every
day you are inside, you are closer to being outside. As someone wrote on
the wall beside my** **DeKalb County Jail bed, "One day closer to home."

...

You face unique dangers the moment you enter jail. From 2008 to
2019, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-deaths/)* *[reported](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-deaths/) more
than 7,500 deaths in jails across the United States. You will witness
life being threatened.** **Prepare yourself emotionally to meet the
moment when it happens. Do not talk about the reason you were arrested.
You are under surveillance at all times while you are locked up. Every
phone call is monitored and recorded. The two largest prison phone
companies use voice-print technologies funded by the Department of
Defense to [archive the voices of everyone who speaks on their
lines](https://theappeal.org/prisons-across-the-u-s-are-quietly-building-databases-of-incarcerated-peoples-voice-prints/).
In every conversation with anyone except your attorney, anything you say
can and very much will be used against you.

***Check the vibe.***

When you walk into the podcage --- it may be a large common room with
cells nestled into the walls and a glass wall in front, a kind of human
terrarium --- with your cell assignment, look at everything around you.
The layout reminded me of a dingy yellow-beige Broadway set with a
staircase down the middle. Notice the words scrawled on the walls and
the smells. Look at the faces of the others being held --- your comrades
in this new unintentional community. Open your heart and be kind but not
foolish. Think of your first few hours in the podcage as the first day
of school or a job but without freedom of movement, speech, dignity, or
humanity.

***Watch the guards.***

The guards are your only connection to food, water, phones, toilet
paper, and other items necessary for a basic level of humanity and
survival. They are complicated characters in this reality.

...

***Make friends.***

People are often sent to jail for the most minor reasons, so the
likelihood that you will be in a podcage with others suffering the same
confusion and anxiety as you is very high. Introduce yourself --- think
of it as an underground party with the worst theme possible. You will
probably meet someone who has been in the podcage for an extended
period.** **That person will have a lot of advice to help you adjust and
become a good community member. Listen and use what makes sense.

My first 24 hours in** **DeKalb County Jail were spent listening to Raja
(all names have been changed) instruct me on how to care for the cell we
shared. She had been there for almost two weeks. She managed to make it
into an immaculate environment by cleaning it daily, slapping soap on
the walls to fight gnat infestations, and saving every unused item. She
had saved the little soaps given with rolls of toilet paper and placed
them on the cell windowsill, where the sun would bake them and release
their scent. Were it not for the scratchy wool blankets,** **lack of pen
and paper,** **constant hunger, and unrelenting screams from those
deemed too mentally ill to roam the podcage freely, I could almost trick
myself into thinking I was in an under-resourced dorm room.

In the common area of the podcage, Bible verses and "Dulce is a lunatic"
were written everywhere. I asked, "Who is Dulce?" She wound up becoming
one of my closest comrades. Held in pretrial detention for a year and a
half, she had become the podcage's mom and mutual-aid hub. People gave
her the items they didn't need to take with them when they left jail.
When I was arrested, my glasses were in my bag. I didn't know I would be
held for so long, so I didn't ask for them --- always ask for your
glasses. If it had not been for Dulce, who gave me a pair of glasses a
former resident of the podcage had left or forgotten, I would not have
been able to read or see any details during my time incarcerated. For
the first two days, I had to ask the other forest defenders to help me
read my jail ID numbers so that I could use the phone and set myself up
with commissary orders. Dulce also said, "If the podcage energy seems
off, lock yourself in your cell." Her guidance saved me from violent
encounters with people unable to regulate their emotions.

You will have only a tiny area available for movement. Many jails in the
United States [do not offer access to the
outside](https://jaapl.org/content/51/1/103#:~:text=Several%20courts%20have%20since%20indicated,Eighth%20Amendment%20for%20convicted%20individuals.) to
exercise, stretch, or simply walk.** **This was one of the hardest
conditions of confinement for me. I typically walk miles daily between
work, mothering, and friending to keep my mind clear. I tried to
dissipate my anxious energy through bodyweight exercises I could
remember: planks, wall pushups, tricep dips, squats, leg lifts, and
glute bridges. Others did yoga sessions together. I had fallen and
twisted my ankle when I was arrested, causing a recent injury in my knee
to swell, so no yoga for me. When in mental distress, exercise, even a
little bit, can help.

Jails across the United States are filled with people suffering from
mental distress, and that will complicate your effort to connect with
others. Be sensitive and aware when people act in unpredictable and
abusive ways. Stay calm, and remember you are dealing with someone who
probably does not have access to therapies, medications, or tools to
self-regulate and is, like you, dealing with inadequate food and sleep
deprivation, the perfect storm of life-threatening dysfunction.

***Waste nothing.***

Every item in jail has multiple purposes. At** **DeKalb County Jail, the
elastic loops from face masks became hair ties and held broken glasses
together. Salt, purchased from the commissary in small packets, was used
not only as a food seasoning but also as a cleaning agent for surfaces
and mouths.** **Toothpaste served as a putty to stick things on the
wall.** **Dulce taught me how to use threads that had fallen off our
uniforms to remove facial hair. We offered to thread anyone who wanted a
jail salon session. The plastic bags our lunches were delivered in
became water containers to slide under the door for people on 24/7
lockdown in cells without running water.

...

***Eat.***

Even if the food served to you seems inedible,** **find ways to eat
around the edges, avoiding mold and insects. Focus on proteins more than
carbs unless the protein is rotten. Eat slowly and drink as much water
as possible to curb your hunger. Beware of the cookies. The sugars can
upset your digestive system. When you feel hungry and angry, go to
sleep, if you can, until it passes. Sleeping will help you conserve
energy and avoid taking "hanger" out on your podcage comrades.

If you can afford the food in the jail commissary --- the fare of gas
stations and rest stops --- buy it and share it with others.

...

***Do. Not. Gossip.***

Most jails do not have anything to distract you. Without books, music,
or games, people are left with conversations. When talking about life on
the outside loses its shine, the focus will shift to those in the
podcage. Don't do it. Do not engage in gossip or hearsay. During moments
of boredom, fill the time with meditation.

. . .

***Live.***

While in jail, you will experience moments that affirm life. For every
person who is freed, shout encouragement as they leave. If someone has a
birthday, honor it. When good news from the outside comes through,
celebrate. Find ways to keep your humanity, even if it is reading and
journaling before dawn when the podcage is at its quietest.

The crumbling buildings of jails and prisons are as ineffective in
rehabilitation as policing is in keeping people safe. Safety and
security begin with a home, food, freedom of movement, and connection to
others. A better society is founded on respect for humanity, dignity,
and belief in the potential of all. The punishment of incarceration lies
in separating people from society, not a total violation of human
rights, not cruel and unusual punishment. While jails exist, our
responsibility is to spotlight how they fail everyone on every level
while demanding their dismantling and decarceration for all. When you
find yourself inside, remember your responsibility is to stay sane and
alive until you are free and can join the struggle to bring everyone
outside. Don't opt for silence after you are released. There is no shame
in getting caught in a system designed to capture people. Remember you
are loved, and your mission is to be released alive and able to tell the
tale while fighting to close every jail.

[]{#_auto_toc_120 .anchor}7.2

New York Penal Law § 35.00 & .05 Justification;  generally

 

## § 35.00 Justification;  a defense

In any prosecution for an offense, justification, as defined in sections
35.05 through 35.30, is a defense.

## § 35.05 Justification;  generally

Unless otherwise limited by the ensuing provisions of this article
defining justifiable use of physical force, conduct which would
otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:

1. Such conduct is required or authorized by law or by a judicial
decree, or is performed by a public servant in the reasonable exercise
of his official powers, duties or functions;  or

2. Such conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an
imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a
situation occasioned or developed through no fault of the actor, and
which is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of
intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding such
injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought
to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue.  The
necessity and justifiability of such conduct may not rest upon
considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the
statute, either in its general application or with respect to its
application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder.  Whenever
evidence relating to the defense of justification under this subdivision
is offered by the defendant, the court shall rule as a matter of law
whether the claimed facts and circumstances would, if established,
constitute a defense.

 

 

 

[]{#_auto_toc_121 .anchor}7.3

New York Penal Law § 35.15 Justification;  use of physical force in
defense of a person

 

1. A person may, subject to the provisions of subdivision two, use
physical force upon another person when and to the extent he or she
reasonably believes such to be necessary to defend himself, herself or a
third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or
imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person, unless:

(a) The latter\'s conduct was provoked by the actor with intent to cause
physical injury to another person;  or

(b) The actor was the initial aggressor;  except that in such case the
use of physical force is nevertheless justifiable if the actor has
withdrawn from the encounter and effectively communicated such
withdrawal to such other person but the latter persists in continuing
the incident by the use or threatened imminent use of unlawful physical
force;  or

(c) The physical force involved is the product of a combat by agreement
not specifically authorized by law.

2. A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under
circumstances specified in subdivision one unless:

(a) The actor reasonably believes that such other person is using or
about to use deadly physical force.  Even in such case, however, the
actor may not use deadly physical force if he or she knows that with
complete personal safety, to oneself and others he or she may avoid the
necessity of so doing by retreating;  except that the actor is under no
duty to retreat if he or she is:

(i) in his or her dwelling and not the initial aggressor;  or

(ii) a police officer or peace officer or a person assisting a police
officer or a peace officer at the latter\'s direction, acting pursuant
to section 35.30;  or

(b) He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing
or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal
sexual act or robbery;  or

(c) He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing
or attempting to commit a burglary, and the circumstances are such that
the use of deadly physical force is authorized by subdivision three of
section 35.20.

\[99\] Chief Judge WACHTLER.

A Grand Jury has indicted defendant on attempted murder, assault, and
other charges for having shot and wounded four youths on a New York City
subway train after one or two of the youths approached him and asked for
\$5. The lower courts, concluding that the prosecutor\'s charge to the
Grand Jury on the defense of justification was erroneous, have dismissed
the attempted murder, assault and weapons possession charges. We now
reverse and reinstate all counts of the indictment.

## I.

The precise circumstances of the incident giving rise to the charges
against defendant are disputed, and ultimately it will be for a trial
jury to determine what occurred. We feel it necessary, however, to
provide some factual background to \[100\] properly frame the legal
issues before us. Accordingly, we have summarized the facts as they
appear from the evidence before the Grand Jury. We stress, however, that
we do not purport to reach any conclusions or holding as to exactly what
transpired or whether defendant is blameworthy. The credibility of
witnesses and the reasonableness of defendant\'s conduct are to be
resolved by the trial jury.

On Saturday afternoon, December 22, 1984, Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey,
James Ramseur, and Barry Allen boarded an IRT express subway train in
The Bronx and headed south toward lower Manhattan. The four youths rode
together in the rear portion of the seventh car of the train. Two of the
four, Ramseur and Cabey, had screwdrivers inside their coats, which they
said were to be used to break into the coin boxes of video machines.

Defendant Bernhard Goetz boarded this subway train at 14th Street in
Manhattan and sat down on a bench towards the rear section of the same
car occupied by the four youths. Goetz was carrying an unlicensed .38
caliber pistol loaded with five rounds of ammunition in a waistband
holster. The train left the 14th Street station and headed towards
Chambers Street.

It appears from the evidence before the Grand Jury that Canty approached
Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and stated \"give me five
dollars\". Neither Canty nor any of the other youths displayed a weapon.
Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out his handgun and firing four
shots in rapid succession. The first shot hit Canty in the chest; the
second struck Allen in the back; the third went through Ramseur\'s arm
and into his left side; the fourth was fired at Cabey, who apparently
was then standing in the corner of the car, but missed, deflecting
instead off of a wall of the conductor\'s cab. After Goetz briefly
surveyed the scene around him, he fired another shot at Cabey, who then
was sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet entered the rear of
Cabey\'s side and severed his spinal cord.

All but two of the other passengers fled the car when, or immediately
after, the shots were fired. The conductor, who had been in the next
car, heard the shots and instructed the motorman to radio for emergency
assistance. The conductor then went into the car where the shooting
occurred and saw Goetz sitting on a bench, the injured youths lying on
the floor or slumped against a seat, and two women who had apparently
\[101\] taken cover, also lying on the floor. Goetz told the conductor
that the four youths had tried to rob him.

While the conductor was aiding the youths, Goetz headed towards the
front of the car. The train had stopped just before the Chambers Street
station and Goetz went between two of the cars, jumped onto the tracks
and fled. Police and ambulance crews arrived at the scene shortly
thereafter. Ramseur and Canty, initially listed in critical condition,
have fully recovered. Cabey remains paralyzed, and has suffered some
degree of brain damage.

On December 31, 1984, Goetz surrendered to police in Concord, New
Hampshire, identifying himself as the gunman being sought for the subway
shootings in New York nine days earlier. Later that day, after receiving
*Miranda* warnings, he made two lengthy statements, both of which were
tape recorded with his permission. In the statements, which are
substantially similar, Goetz admitted that he had been illegally
carrying a handgun in New York City for three years. He stated that he
had first purchased a gun in 1981 after he had been injured in a
mugging. Goetz also revealed that twice between 1981 and 1984 he had
successfully warded off assailants simply by displaying the pistol.

According to Goetz\'s statement, the first contact he had with the four
youths came when Canty, sitting or lying on the bench across from him,
asked \"how are you,\" to which he replied \"fine\". Shortly thereafter,
Canty, followed by one of the other youths, walked over to the defendant
and stood to his left, while the other two youths remained to his right,
in the corner of the subway car. Canty then said \"give me five
dollars\". Goetz stated that he knew from the smile on Canty\'s face
that they wanted to \"play with me\". Although he was certain that none
of the youths had a gun, he had a fear, based on prior experiences, of
being \"maimed\".

Goetz then established \"a pattern of fire,\" deciding specifically to
fire from left to right. His stated intention at that point was to
\"murder \[the four youths\], to hurt them, to make them suffer as much
as possible\". When Canty again requested money, Goetz stood up, drew
his weapon, and began firing, aiming for the center of the body of each
of the four. Goetz recalled that the first two he shot \"tried to run
through the crowd \[but\] they had nowhere to run\". Goetz then turned
to his right to \"go after the other two\". One of these two \"tried to
run through the wall of the train, but \* \* \* he had \[102\] nowhere
to go\". The other youth (Cabey) \"tried pretending that he wasn\'t with
\[the others\]\" by standing still, holding on to one of the subway hand
straps, and not looking at Goetz. Goetz nonetheless fired his fourth
shot at him. He then ran back to the first two youths to make sure they
had been \"taken care of\". Seeing that they had both been shot, he spun
back to check on the latter two. Goetz noticed that the youth who had
been standing still was now sitting on a bench and seemed unhurt. As
Goetz told the police, \"I said \`\[y\]ou seem to be all right, here\'s
another\'\", and he then fired the shot which severed Cabey\'s spinal
cord. Goetz added that \"if I was a little more under self-control \* \*
\* I would have put the barrel against his forehead and fired.\" He also
admitted that \"if I had had more \[bullets\], I would have shot them
again, and again, and again.\"

## II.

After waiving extradition, Goetz was brought back to New York and
arraigned on a felony complaint charging him with attempted murder and
criminal possession of a weapon. The matter was presented to a Grand
Jury in January 1985, with the prosecutor seeking an indictment for
attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and criminal
possession of a weapon. Neither the defendant nor any of the wounded
youths testified before this Grand Jury. On January 25, 1985, the Grand
Jury indicted defendant on one count of criminal possession of a weapon
in the third degree (Penal Law § 265.02), for possessing the gun used in
the subway shootings, and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon
in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01), for possessing two other guns
in his apartment building. It dismissed, however, the attempted murder
and other charges stemming from the shootings themselves.

Several weeks after the Grand Jury\'s action, the People, asserting that
they had newly available evidence, moved for an order authorizing them
to resubmit the dismissed charges to a second Grand Jury (*see*, CPL
190.75 \[3\]). Supreme Court, Criminal Term, after conducting an in
camera inquiry, granted the motion. Presentation of the case to the
second Grand Jury began on March 14, 1985. Two of the four youths, Canty
and Ramseur, testified. Among the other witnesses were four passengers
from the seventh car of the subway who had seen some portions of the
incident. Goetz again chose not to \[103\] testify, though the tapes of
his two statements were played for the grand jurors, as had been done
with the first Grand Jury.

On March 27, 1985, the second Grand Jury filed a 10-count indictment,
containing four charges of attempted murder (Penal Law §§ 110.00, 125.25
\[1\]), four charges of assault in the first degree (Penal Law § 120.10
\[1\]), one charge of reckless endangerment in the first degree (Penal
Law § 120.25), and one charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the
second degree (Penal Law § 265.03 \[possession of loaded firearm with
intent to use it unlawfully against another\]). Goetz was arraigned on
this indictment on March 28, 1985, and it was consolidated with the
earlier three-count
indictment.[^\[1\]^](#X95f82840f2a93242ce6dd4a7741c3a519fd6625)

On October 14, 1985, Goetz moved to dismiss the charges contained in the
second indictment alleging, among other things, that the evidence before
the second Grand Jury was not legally sufficient to establish the
offenses charged (*see*, CPL 210.20 \[1\] \[b\]), and that the
prosecutor\'s instructions to that Grand Jury on the defense of
justification were erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant so as to
render its proceedings defective (*see*, CPL 210.20 \[1\] \[c\]; 210.35
\[5\]).

On November 25, 1985, while the motion to dismiss was pending before
Criminal Term, a column appeared in the *New York Daily News* containing
an interview which the columnist had conducted with Darryl Cabey the
previous day in Cabey\'s hospital room. The columnist claimed that Cabey
had told him in this interview that the other three youths had all
approached Goetz with the intention of robbing him. The day after the
column was published, a New York City police officer informed the
prosecutor that he had been one of the first police officers to enter
the subway car after the shootings, and that Canty had said to him \"we
were going to rob \[Goetz\]\". The prosecutor immediately disclosed this
information to the court and to defense counsel, adding that this was
the first time his office had been told of this alleged statement and
that none of the police reports filed on the incident contained any such
information. Goetz then orally expanded his motion to \[104\] dismiss,
asserting that resubmission of the charges voted by the second Grand
Jury was required under *People v Pelchat* (62 N.Y.2d 97) because it
appeared, from this new information, that Ramseur and Canty had
committed perjury.

In an order dated January 21, 1986, Criminal Term granted Goetz\'s
motion to the extent that it dismissed all counts of the second
indictment, other than the reckless endangerment charge, with leave to
resubmit these charges to a third Grand Jury. The court, after
inspection of the Grand Jury minutes, first rejected Goetz\'s contention
that there was not legally sufficient evidence to support the charges.
It held, however, that the prosecutor, in a supplemental charge
elaborating upon the justification defense, had erroneously introduced
an objective element into this defense by instructing the grand jurors
to consider whether Goetz\'s conduct was that of a \"reasonable man in
\[Goetz\'s\] situation\". The court, citing prior decisions from both
the First and Second Departments (*see, e.g.*, *People v Santiago*, 110
AD2d 569 \[1st Dept\]; *People v Wagman*, 99 AD2d 519 \[2d Dept\]),
concluded that the statutory test for whether the use of deadly force is
justified to protect a person should be wholly subjective, focusing
entirely on the defendant\'s state of mind when he used such force. It
concluded that dismissal was required for this error because the
justification issue was at the heart of the
case.[^\[2\]^](#Xeb57bf2bcd03653cc7b5da845291a494441a0b7)

Criminal Term also concluded that dismissal and resubmission of the
charges were required under *People v Pelchat* (*supra*) because the
*Daily News* column and the statement by the police officer to the
prosecution strongly indicated that the testimony of Ramseur and Canty
was perjured. Because the additional evidence before the second Grand
Jury, as contrasted with that before the first Grand Jury, consisted
largely of the testimony of these two youths, the court found that the
integrity of the second Grand Jury was \"severely undermined\" by the
apparently perjured testimony.

On appeal by the People, a divided Appellate Division \[105\] affirmed
Criminal Term\'s dismissal of the charges. The plurality opinion by
Justice Kassal, concurred in by Justice Carro, agreed with Criminal
Term\'s reasoning on the justification issue, stating that the grand
jurors should have been instructed to consider only the defendant\'s
subjective beliefs as to the need to use deadly force. Justice Kupferman
concurred in the result reached by the plurality on the ground that the
prosecutor\'s charge did not adequately apprise the grand jurors of the
need to consider Goetz\'s own background and learning. Neither the
plurality nor the concurring opinion discussed Criminal Term\'s reliance
on *Pelchat* as an alternate ground for dismissal.

Justice Asch, in a dissenting opinion in which Justice Wallach
concurred, disagreed with both bases for dismissal relied upon by
Criminal Term. On the justification question, he opined that the statute
requires consideration of both the defendant\'s subjective beliefs and
whether a reasonable person in defendant\'s situation would have had
such beliefs. Accordingly, he found no error in the prosecutor\'s
introduction of an objective element into the justification defense. On
the *Pelchat* issue, Justice Asch noted the extensive differences
between the Grand Jury evidence in that case and the case at bar and
concluded that the out-of-court statements attributed to Cabey and Canty
did not affect the validity of the indictment. In a separate dissenting
opinion, Justice Wallach stressed that the plurality\'s adoption of a
purely subjective test effectively eliminated any reasonableness
requirement contained in the statute.

Justice Asch granted the People leave to appeal to this court. We agree
with the dissenters that neither the prosecutor\'s charge to the Grand
Jury on justification nor the information which came to light while the
motion to dismiss was pending required dismissal of any of the charges
in the second indictment.

## III.

Penal Law article 35 recognizes the defense of justification, which
\"permits the use of force under certain circumstances\" (*see*, *People
v McManus*, 67 N.Y.2d 541, 545). One such set of circumstances pertains
to the use of force in defense of a person, encompassing both
self-defense and defense of a third person (Penal Law § 35.15). Penal
Law § 35.15 (1) sets forth the general principles governing all such
uses of force: \"\[a\] \[106\] person may \* \* \* use physical force
upon another person when and to the extent he *reasonably believes* such
to be necessary to defend himself or a third person from what he
*reasonably believes* to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical
force by such other person\" (emphasis
added).[^\[3\]^](#Xea5aee11d91002c0235987dfe4ae77971a7f55a)

Section 35.15 (2) sets forth further limitations on these general
principles with respect to the use of \"deadly physical force\": \"A
person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under
circumstances specified in subdivision one unless (a) He *reasonably
believes* that such other person is using or about to use deadly
physical force \* \*
\*[^\[4\]^](#X83220df2f87b2228e25525ab3c6c545ac08815f) or (b) He
*reasonably believes* that such other person is committing or attempting
to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery\"
(emphasis added).

Thus, consistent with most justification provisions, Penal Law § 35.15
permits the use of deadly physical force only where requirements as to
triggering conditions and the necessity of a particular response are met
(*see*, Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses § 121 \[a\], at 2). As to the
triggering conditions, the statute requires that the actor \"reasonably
believes\" that another person either is using or about to use deadly
physical force or is committing or attempting to commit one of certain
enumerated felonies, including robbery. As to the need for the use of
deadly physical force as a response, the statute requires that the actor
\"reasonably believes\" that such force is necessary to avert the
perceived threat.[^\[5\]^](#X564c911d9d44cf47d2bd77f39214712fa6defbc)

Because the evidence before the second Grand Jury included statements by
Goetz that he acted to protect himself from being maimed or to avert a
robbery, the prosecutor correctly chose to charge the justification
defense in section 35.15 to the Grand Jury (*see*, CPL 190.25 \[6\];
*People v Valles*, 62 N.Y.2d 36, 38). The prosecutor properly instructed
the grand jurors to \[107\] consider whether the use of deadly physical
force was justified to prevent either serious physical injury or a
robbery, and, in doing so, to separately analyze the defense with
respect to each of the charges. He elaborated upon the prerequisites for
the use of deadly physical force essentially by reading or paraphrasing
the language in Penal Law § 35.15. The defense does not contend that he
committed any error in this portion of the charge.

When the prosecutor had completed his charge, one of the grand jurors
asked for clarification of the term \"reasonably believes\". The
prosecutor responded by instructing the grand jurors that they were to
consider the circumstances of the incident and determine \"whether the
defendant\'s conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant\'s
situation\". It is this response by the prosecutor --- and specifically
his use of \"a reasonable man\" --- which is the basis for the dismissal
of the charges by the lower courts. As expressed repeatedly in the
Appellate Division\'s plurality opinion, because section 35.15 uses the
term *\"he* reasonably believes\", the appropriate test, according to
that court, is whether a defendant\'s beliefs and reactions were
\"reasonable *to him\"*. Under that reading of the statute, a jury which
believed a defendant\'s testimony that he felt that his own actions were
warranted and were reasonable would have to acquit him, regardless of
what anyone else in defendant\'s situation might have concluded. Such an
interpretation defies the ordinary meaning and significance of the term
\"reasonably\" in a statute, and misconstrues the clear intent of the
Legislature, in enacting section 35.15, to retain an objective element
as part of any provision authorizing the use of deadly physical force.

Penal statutes in New York have long codified the right recognized at
common law to use deadly physical force, under appropriate
circumstances, in self-defense (*see, e.g.*, 1829 Rev Stat of NY, part
IV, ch 1, tit II, § 3; 1881 Penal Code § 205; *People v McManus*,
*supra*, at p 546). These provisions have never required that an
actor\'s belief as to the intention of another person to inflict serious
injury be correct in order for the use of deadly force to be justified,
but they have uniformly required that the belief comport with an
objective notion of reasonableness. The 1829 statute, using language
which was followed almost in its entirety until the 1965 recodification
of the Penal Law, provided that the use of deadly force was justified in
self-defense or in the defense of specified third persons \"when there
shall be a reasonable ground to apprehend \[108\] a design to commit a
felony, or to do some great personal injury, and there shall be imminent
danger of such design being accomplished\".

In *Shorter v People* (2 N.Y. 193), we emphasized that deadly force
could be justified under the statute even if the actor\'s beliefs as to
the intentions of another turned out to be wrong, but noted there had to
be a reasonable basis, viewed objectively, for the beliefs. We
explicitly rejected the position that the defendant\'s own belief that
the use of deadly force was necessary sufficed to justify such force
regardless of the reasonableness of the beliefs (*id.*, at pp 200-201).

In 1881, New York reexamined the many criminal provisions set forth in
the revised statutes and enacted, for the first time, a separate Penal
Code (*see generally*, 1937 Report of NY Law Rev Commn, Communication to
Legislature Relating to Homicide, at 525, 529 \[hereafter cited as
Communication Relating to Homicide\]). The provision in the 1881 Penal
Code for the use of deadly force in self-defense or to defend a third
person was virtually a reenactment of the language in the 1829
statutes,[^\[6\]^](#X87cfc2e351e344c2618a395b8039fcc24117301) and the
\"reasonable ground\" requirement was maintained.

The 1909 Penal Law replaced the 1881 Penal Code. The language of section
205 of the 1881 code pertaining to the use of deadly force in
self-defense or in defense of a third person was reenacted, verbatim, as
part of section 1055 of the new Penal Law. Several cases from this court
interpreting the 1909 provision demonstrate unmistakably that an
objective element of reasonableness was a vital part of any claim of
self-defense. In *People v Lumsden* (201 N.Y. 264, 268), we approved a
charge to the jury which instructed it to consider whether the
circumstances facing defendant were such \"as would lead a reasonable
man to believe that \[an assailant\] is about to kill or to do great
bodily injury\" (*see also*, *People v Ligouri*, 284 N.Y. 309, 316,
317). We emphatically rejected the position that any belief by an actor
as to the intention of another to cause severe injury was a sufficient
basis for his use of deadly force, and stated specifically that a belief
based upon \"mere fear or fancy or remote hearsay information or a
delusion pure and simple\" would not satisfy the requirements of the
statute (201 NY, at p 269). In *People v Tomlins* (213 N.Y. 240, 244),
\[109\] we set forth the governing test as being whether \"the situation
justified the defendant as a reasonable man in believing that he was
about to be murderously attacked.\"

Accordingly, the Law Revision Commission, in a 1937 Report to the
Legislature on the Law of Homicide in New York, summarized the
self-defense statute as requiring a \"reasonable belief in the imminence
of danger\", and stated that the standard to be followed by a jury in
determining whether a belief was reasonable \"is that of a man of
ordinary courage in the circumstances surrounding the defendant at the
time of the killing\" (Communication Relating to Homicide, *op. cit.*,
at 814). The Report added that New York did not follow the view, adopted
in a few States, that \"the jury is required to adopt the subjective
view and judge from the standpoint of the very defendant concerned\"
(*id.*, at 814).

In 1961 the Legislature established a Commission to undertake a complete
revision of the Penal Law and the Criminal Code. The impetus for the
decision to update the Penal Law came in part from the drafting of the
Model Penal Code by the American Law Institute, as well as from the fact
that the existing law was poorly organized and in many aspects
antiquated (*see, e.g.*, *Criminal Law Revision Through A Legislative
Commission: The New York Experience*, 18 Buff L Rev 213; Note, *Proposed
Penal Law of New York*, 64 Colum L Rev 1469). Following the submission
by the Commission of several reports and proposals, the Legislature
approved the present Penal Law in 1965 (L 1965, ch 1030), and it became
effective on September 1, 1967. The drafting of the general provisions
of the new Penal Law (*see*, Penal Law part I), including the article on
justification (*id.,* art 35), was particularly influenced by the Model
Penal Code (*see*, Denzer, *Drafting a New York Penal Law for New York*,
18 Buff L Rev 251, 252; Wechsler, *Codification of Criminal Law in the
United States: The Model Penal Code*, 68 Colum L Rev 1425, 1428). While
using the Model Penal Code provisions on justification as general
guidelines, however, the drafters of the new Penal Law did not simply
adopt them verbatim.

**\[ ... \]**

Interpreting the statute to require only that the defendant\'s belief
was \"reasonable to *him,\"* as done by the plurality below, would
hardly be different from requiring only a genuine belief; in either
case, the defendant\'s own perceptions could completely exonerate him
from any criminal liability.

We cannot lightly impute to the Legislature an intent to fundamentally
alter the principles of justification to allow the perpetrator of a
serious crime to go free simply because that person believed his actions
were reasonable and necessary to prevent some perceived harm. To
completely exonerate such an individual, no matter how aberrational or
bizarre his thought patterns, would allow citizens to set their own
standards for the permissible use of force. It would also allow a
legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill or perform
acts of violence with impunity, contrary to fundamental principles of
justice and criminal law.

We can only conclude that the Legislature retained a reasonableness
requirement to avoid giving a license for such actions. The plurality\'s
interpretation, as the dissenters below recognized, excises the impact
of the word \"reasonably\". This same conclusion was recently reached in
Justice Levine\'s decision for a unanimous Third Department in *People v
Astle* (117 AD2d 382), in which that court declined to follow the First
Department\'s decision in this case (*see also*, *People v Hamel*, 96
AD2d 644 \[3d Dept\]).

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Statutes or rules of law requiring a person to act \"reasonably\" or to
have a \"reasonable belief\" uniformly prescribe conduct meeting an
objective standard measured with reference to how \"a reasonable
person\" could have acted (*see, e.g.*, *People v Cantor*, 36 N.Y.2d
106; *Donovan v Kaszycki & Sons Contrs.*, 599 F Supp 860, 871; Klotter,
Criminal Law, at 312; Fletcher, *The Right and the Reasonable*, 98 Harv
L Rev 949; 57 Am Jur 2d, Negligence, §§ 67, 68). In *People v Cantor*
(*supra*), we had before us a provision of the Criminal Procedure Law
authorizing a police officer to stop a person \"when *he reasonably
suspects* that such person is committing, has committed or is about to
commit \[a crime\]\" (CPL 140.50 \[1\]; emphasis added). We held that
this section authorized \"stops\" only when the police officer had \"the
quantum of knowledge sufficient to induce an ordinarily prudent and
cautious man \[113\] under the circumstances to believe criminal
activity is at hand\" (*People v Cantor*, 36 NY2d, at pp 112-113,
*supra*).

**\[ ... \]**

Goetz also argues that the introduction of an objective element will
preclude a jury from considering factors such as the prior experiences
of a given actor and thus, require it to make a determination of
\"reasonableness\" without regard to the actual circumstances of a
particular incident. This argument, however, falsely presupposes that an
objective standard means that the background and other relevant
characteristics of a particular actor must be ignored. To the contrary,
we have frequently noted that a determination of reasonableness must be
based on the \"circumstances\" facing a defendant or his \"situation\"
*(see, e.g.*, *People v Ligouri*, 284 N.Y. 309, 316, *supra;* *People v
Lumsden*, 201 N.Y. 264, 268, *supra).* Such terms encompass more than
the physical movements of the potential assailant. *These* terms include
any relevant knowledge the defendant had about that person. They also
necessarily bring in the physical attributes of all persons involved,
including the defendant. Furthermore, the defendant\'s circumstances
encompass any prior experiences he had which could provide a reasonable
basis for a belief that another person\'s intentions were to injure or
rob him or that the use of deadly force was necessary under the
circumstances.

Accordingly, a jury should be instructed to consider this \[115\] type
of evidence in weighing the defendant\'s actions. The jury must first
determine whether the defendant had the requisite beliefs under section
35.15, that is, whether he believed deadly force was necessary to avert
the imminent use of deadly force or the commission of one of the
felonies enumerated therein. If the People do not prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he did not have such beliefs, then the jury must
also consider whether these beliefs were reasonable. The jury would have
to determine, in light of all the \"circumstances\", as explicated
above, if a reasonable person could have had these beliefs.

The prosecutor\'s instruction to the second Grand Jury that it had to
determine whether, under the circumstances, Goetz\'s conduct was that of
a reasonable man in his situation was thus essentially an accurate
charge. It is true that the prosecutor did not elaborate on the meaning
of \"circumstances\" or \"situation\" and inform the grand jurors that
they could consider, for example, the prior experiences Goetz related in
his statement to the police. We have held, however, that a Grand Jury
need not be instructed on the law with the same degree of precision as
the petit jury (*see*, *People v Valles*, 62 N.Y.2d 36, 38; *People v
Calbud, Inc.*, 49 N.Y.2d 389, 394; *compare*, CPL 190.25 \[6\], *with*
CPL 300.10 \[2\]). This lesser standard is premised upon the different
functions of the Grand Jury and the petit jury: the former determines
whether sufficient evidence exists to accuse a person of a crime and
thereby subject him to criminal prosecution; the latter ultimately
determines the guilt or innocence of the accused, and may convict only
where the People have proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt *(see*,
*People v Calbud, Inc.*, 49 NY2d, at p 394, *supra).*

In *People v Calbud, Inc.* (*supra*, at pp 394-395), we stated that the
prosecutor simply had to \"provid\[e\] the Grand Jury with enough
information to enable it intelligently to decide whether a crime has
been committed and to determine whether there exists legally sufficient
evidence to establish the material elements of the crime\". Of course,
as noted above, where the evidence suggests that a complete defense such
as justification may be present, the prosecutor must charge the grand
jurors on that defense, providing enough information to enable them to
determine whether the defense, in light of the evidence, should preclude
the criminal prosecution. The prosecutor more than adequately fulfilled
this obligation here. His instructions were not as complete as the
court\'s charge on justification should be, but they sufficiently
apprised the \[116\] Grand Jury of the existence and requirements of
that defense to allow it to intelligently decide that there is
sufficient evidence tending to disprove justification and necessitating
a trial. The Grand Jury has indicted Goetz. It will now be for the petit
jury to decide whether the prosecutor can prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that Goetz\'s reactions were unreasonable and therefore excessive.

Ristroph, Notes on Goetz

 

From Alice Ristroph, Criminal Law: An Integrated Approach

 

Goetz was charged with attempted murder. . . The state relied on the
portion of the New York second degree murder statute that criminalized
an intentional killing: "A person is guilty of murder in the second
degree when \"... \[w\]ith intent to cause the death of another person,
he causes the death of such person...." Notice that Goetz did not
contest that he tried to cause the death of his victims, or that he had
intent to kill them. Indeed, he testified that his intent was to
"murder" them. That claim of intent illustrates the distinctive nature
of an affirmative defense. Goetz could concede that his conduct and
mental state met the definition of attempted murder in New York, but he
argued that even so he should not be pun- ished because his
actions---which did violate the terms of the murder statute---were
justified.

After the New York Court of Appeals reinstated the charges (in the
opinion you've just read), this case went to trial, and the jury
acquitted Goetz of all charges except weapons possession. He spent eight
months in jail. The case and trial captured national attention; Goetz
was called "the subway vigilante" and embraced by many who saw his
actions as a necessary response to prevalent urban crime. The court's
opinion does not mention the races of the persons involved (Goetz was
white, the four young men he shot were Black), but by one observer's
account, racialized imagery and fears loomed large in the trial.
Professor George Fletcher observed the trial and later reported that
neither the prosecution or defense explicitly mentioned race, but
Goetz's defense referred to the Black youths as "savages," "predators,"
and "vultures." According to Fletcher,

"The covert appeal to racial bias came out most dramatically in \[a
re-enactment\] of the shooting... The nominal purpose of the
demonstration was to show the way in which the bullet entered the body
of each victim. The defense's real purpose, however, was to recreate for
the jury ... the scene that Goetz encoun- tered when four black
passengers began to surround him. \[Goetz's attorney\] asked the
Guardian Angels \[a volunteer crime patrol organization\] to send him
... four young black men to act as the props in the demonstration. In
came the four young black Guardian Angels, fit and muscular, dressed in
T-shirts, to play the parts..." George P. Fletcher, *A Crime of
Self-Defense: Bernhard Goetz and the Law on Trial* 206-207 (1988).

. . . Some scholars have argued that the racial identity of parties
operates (impermissibly, but unavoidably) as a kind of character
evidence, because jurors are likely to draw conclusions about the
parties on the basis of their racial identities. See Jasmine B. Gonzales
Rose, *Toward A Critical Race Theory of Evi- dence*, 101 Minn. L. Rev.
2243, 2261-2268 (2017).

Darrell Cabey, who was shot in the spine and left paralyzed, sued Goetz
in civil court and won a \$43 million judgment in 1996. Goetz declared
bankruptcy, however, and Cabey was unable to collect the judgment. As
one newspaper reported,

"The jury's decision was a stunning reversal for Goetz, 48, who was
acquitted of attempted murder nine years ago in the same shooting and
become a national symbol of urban rage and frustration.

But this time around---in a civil as opposed to a criminal trial, before
a largely black jury in the Bronx instead of a largely white one in
Manhattan, and at a time when crime here is on the downswing as opposed
to the upswing---the six-person jury ruled against Goetz in about five
hours.

It found that Goetz acted "recklessly" and "outrageously" in his attack
on Darrell Cabey, now 30, who was left brain damaged and paralyzed from
the chest down by one of Goetz's bullets."

Little of That*, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, April 24, 1996.

The Trial of Bernhard Goetz: Goetz\'s Videotaped Confession

 

**The following excerpt from the interview is included in The Trial of
Bernhard Goetz (Aae Films, 1988).**

*On December 31, 1984, after turning himself in to Concord, New
Hampshire police, Bernhard Goetz was subjected to two lengthy
interviews. The first was an audiotaped interviewed with Concord police
detectives and the second was a more contentious two-hour videotaped
interview with three New York City police detectives, Susan Braver,
Michael Clark, and Dan Hattendorf\....This excerpt from what is commonly
called Goetz\'s \"confession,\" reveals Goetz to be\--at least at the
time of the interview\--in a highly disturbed state of mind.*

Braver: Mr. Goetz, I am assistant district attorney, Susan Braver from
the New York county town of Manhattan district attorney's office, this
gentlemen are Mr. Hattendorf of the transit police squad and Detective
Clark of the New York Police Department\...Now, you indicated earlier to
us that you. You indicated earlier to the detective here that you would
to speak with us about this incident.

Goetz: Oh God, when I hear Manhattener's speak, I didn't want to.

Braver: Mr. Goetz, this is all on video tape.

Goetz: Sure, sure.

Braver: Nothing that is said in this room is off the video tape.

Goetz: That's..that's that's....

Braver: For your protection and for ours.

Goetz: That's fine. I don't, I don't want to be rude but I just don't
want to speak to you. I have nothing to say.

Clark: Bernard.

Goetz: You don't understand.

Clark: Bernard

Clark: Could I talk to you?

Goetz: Sure.

Braver: Before they do that\....I want to be sure you understand that
you have all your rights in connection with speaking to us.

Goetz: Okay.

Braver: Okay?

Goetz: Okay.

Braver: If you will let Detective Clark....please let Detective Clark
tell it to you, okay

Clark: Bernard, could I just explain some things to you\....Sit
back..first of all I would like for you to just try and relax a little
bit, okay?\...Sit back...just sit back.

Goetz: Nothing I've got to say is going to make sense.

Goetz: In order for...I know, in order I...I...I... you want this to end
huh?

Clark: I know you want this to be over. I know you came in voluntarily.
This thing must be weighing heavily on your mind.

Goetz: That's not important. That's not important. Get to the point, get
to the point.

Braver: The point...the point. The point is Mr. Goetz right off the bat,
I \'m going to tell you I want to be sure you understand exactly what it
is we're doing here, okay? Now, you have the right to remain silent\--do
you know that?

Goetz: Okay, okay

Braver: Do you understand?

Goetz: I...I... just don't know what to say to you.

Braver: Do you understand that you don't have to talk to us?

Goetz: Yes, okay...My, my\...I .. I don't want to talk to you. I don't
want to talk to you. All right, all right, all right. I can't, I can't
believe I'm saying this, I\... I\... I\... I apologize for it but I\...
I\... I\... just, I just I don't want to talk to you.

Braver: Would you like a cup of coffee or something?

Goetz: No, I'd like to get out of here.

Braver: Are you cold?

Goetz: No, I'm not. I just, I would just like to get out of this room.

Braver: We would like to resolve this.

Goetz: Okay, good you would like to resolve it. I know you would like
to.

Braver: And I know you would.

Goetz: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah isn't that great? I apologize I know, I know
I'm not being civil because for you this is all business that's, that's,
that's what this is for you, all business, you know. I\... I\... I
don't, I don't, I don't, I don't want to be rude to you, I'm, I'm, I'm
sorry, I just, I just, I just, I just you, you, you, say I have the
right to remain silent?

Braver: Yes.

Goetz: That's what I prefer to do, that's, that's what I prefer, I\'m
sorry. I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not hiding behind this thing but,
but, just when I hear I\... I\... I\... I don't know how I can explain
this to you as individuals, but just when I hear people from the
Manhattan business world talk and, and, and their tone of voice,
Manhattan.

Braver: We all live in Manhattan

Goetz: Yes and its, its, its, its, its, it makes, I.., I.., I.., I..,
I.., I can't stand it, just, just, just the sound. It's, it's, it's it's
it's, it's all, you know how, how if, if, if, if, if you, if you want
the information I'm I'm giving you all the information and, and, and if
you want to know something the worst that was said about me is true. For
a period of time I was a cold-blooded murderer. Now, they didn't, I mean
that may not even come to pass but that's what I really really was,
okay. Now, now all those things there I'll, I'll sign it. You have, you
have all the facts and and what you want to do with it but but hearing
people saying all the time what is right and and and what is wrong and
and people don't people they don't even know, they, they, they don't
even know. Is this what they typed? Is this what they typed?

Braver: This is what I was handed here in New Hampshire.

Goetz: Okay, I'll sign it. Sure yeah, this is it. This is, this is it.

Braver: Um...if you want us to take this as your statement I have to
know what it says, it's what you said.

Goetz: What, what, ah, oh, oh, okay, sure, sure, sure, ah that's, ah
that's true. Ah that's true.

Braver: Sir, I'd like you to careful and and and look at it.

Goetz: That's true.

Goetz: What is this \"yah, yah\"? I never said \"yah yah.\" I said yes.
I might of said \"yeah yeah, the train was moving,\" I never said \"yah
yah.\" Yah, yah\....Maybe um..um..well somebody else said\...

Clark: Maybe in New Hampshire a New York \"yeah \"is a New Hampshire
\"yah\"\-- a \"yeah\" in New York is a New Hampshire \"yah.\"

Braver: Are you um, um are you looking at that?

Goetz: Yes, I am.

Braver: You can read that quickly?

Goetz: Well no, I'm not reading every line but these are ah these are
these are all phrases every I.. I.. I.. I just spot things and I ...
this is true, this is true.

Braver: Would it really be a hardship for you to read that every line?

Goetz: If you insist.

Braver: It's important to you.

Goetz: If you insist.

Braver: It's better, you could, um, talk to me or you could read every
line if you say this you talking to me.

Goetz: That's that's that's so important for the technicalities isn't
it?

Braver: No.

Goetz: Oh yes it's\...It's for you\....All of this has be formalities
and and by the rules\...

Braver: No, it's for you.

Goetz: Oh yes, yes, for my protection.

Braver: It's for your protection.

Goetz: Do you know how sick your legal system makes me Miss? Miss, I..
I.. I just don't want to talk to you again. New York city is a system
that knows so much and is so good you decide what you decide what is
right and wrong.

Braver: The people will.

Goetz: Oh you're so competent the people will\...God, the people will
the people will.

Braver: This has to go the grand jury, Mr. Goetz.

Goetz: This has to go to the grand jury. Isn\'t that wonderful? It's
it's a part of your system. It's just great, it's just great. I.. I.. I
tell you the government in the city is\--it's a disgrace and if you
don't now look I may be the biggest piece of bleep in the world and you
can drag me through the dirt, I don't care, but there is a bigger issue
and that is the government of New York city is a disgrace. I've heard
things said about me\--that I am uncivilized, okay or I acted in an
uncivilized way, in the most, if you think this is vicious, if you know
what is in my mind is the most vicious thing that I can think of is that
person who said that, I.. I wish they were sitting there in that seat
instead of me, that would have been beautiful. I mean, I wish I was
never there and they were there\--that would of been great. People talk
about law and order and, you know, and and\... and lawlessness, you talk
you talk about lawlessness. This city doesn't care about lawlessness.
You talk about anarchy that's what there is now. I don't care what you
do to me\--it doesn't matter. You see I'm not hiding anything but but
all this is it's it's like a dam and water is building up behind the dam
and eventually and this is just a crack in the dam or a little hole
that's in the dam and eventually something. What I did down there was,
let's say it's wrong, that doesn't bother me, but what this did is it
showed the system as being a sham. That's why the city so vehemently
attacked the Guardian Angels\--because\...because\...because the sham
showed the city for it is. It showed the legal system for what it is. It
is a sham.

Braver: How does it show the legal system for what it is?

Goetz: Because because people who are violent are just like let back out
on the street again and again and they're charged with nothing. Do you
do you understand that? If, if..if..if\...if\...if a person has to be
reduced to this kind of animal to survive in the city\--I mean if you
take a rat, okay, I was vicious, I don't deny it, if, if, if, if you
take a rat and you corner it and you, ah let's say just one time you
start poking it with red hot needles and the rat, the rat, doesn't know
how to react when do you this okay and you wind up doing it again or you
know perhaps again and if once in awhile the rat turns viciously on you
and becomes a\...a\...a\...a\...a totally vicious killer\--which is
which is really what I was\--then don't don't go passing statements of
morality saying \"ah, well this was not warranted\" or \"this was ah or
you know he should have done this or all he had to do was show the
gun.\" I've been situations where I've shown the gun. What happened here
is I snapped, show them the gun at one point would ah...

Braver: How come you didn't show the gun the other times and this time
you did? Was there anything that that\...

Goetz: You don't, you don't, you\...you\...you weren't there, you
weren't there\--what okay I'm going to give give you an honest answer,
you don't you don't understand. The threat, when I was surrounded at at
that point showing the gun would have been enough but when I saw this
one fellow, when I saw the gleam in his eye and and the smile on his
face and and and they say it's a joke and lot of them say it's a joke...

Clark: Was he the one that ask for the money?

Goetz: What?

Clark: Was he the one that asked for the money?

Goetz: \[Sighing\]..I don't care about the technicality. Asking for the
money is bullshit. The guy\--his his exact words were \"Give me five
dollars\"\--that's bullshit. The robbery had nothing to do it. When I
saw, when I saw his smile and the look in his eye and and you\...you
can't understand this how can people like you be familiar with violence?
If okay\--if\...if you have a skull with a glass globe in the center,
people can come up to that skull and break the teeth and and break the
jaw and whatever right and ah. What the city will do is they will help
you wire up the jaw together and and put the teeth in and and patch up
and and the glass globe inside is is shattered still and on the outside
everything everything is fine so as long as things on the surface are
patched up the city says fine everything is okay and it's not like that.
If\...if\...if the city doesn't change eventually the city is going to
reap it's\...it's\...it's\...it's going to reap the harvest that it
sowed, okay? And and and sign

Braver: Mr. Goetz why these four? Why these four?

Goetz: Oh\...oh\...oh isn't that beautiful? You you ask the question in
in in an intellectual way: \"Why these four?\"

Braver: Why these four?

Goetz: I didn't pick out these four. I never met those guys. I told you
guys in here I\...I never met them.

Braver: But why these four though, I mean...

Goetz: Because, because, because I saw what they were intending to do
with me, Miss. They were intending, they were intending to play with me
like a cat plays with a mouse. Now, you're not familiar with violence ah
\[sighs\]. There, there are so many details. It's all, it's all in here.
There so many things that happen afterwards it would it would take it
would take 10 minutes, 20 minutes to describe I've been through it and
it's so painful to go through it again and again.

Clark: I know but we're just trying to verify that what you did is what
you said you did\....But, but but what about the five shots did that
come out the newspaper? Well which victim did you\...

Goetz: Victim! Victim! You call him the victim?
Okay\...okay\...I\...I\...I accept, I\...I\...I accept. I\...I accept
that, I accept that they are the victims. I'm not going to contest
anything, I'm not going to contest anything.

Clark: Bernard which one was he in the sequence of the shooting?

Goetz: Okay, okay he would have been, he would have been
ah\...ah\...ah\...um\...the\...the\...the\...ah\...the sequence is
um\...um\...um\...not, not a simple sequence\...

Clark: Okay, as best you can just tell me which one would have been
up\...

Goetz: In my mind I what what frightens me is either I missed somebody
once, and that means I shouldn't have been shooting at all. That doesn't
bother me. I, ah\...Let me say I wanted to I told those guys here
already. I wanted to kill those guys. I wanted to maim those guys. I
wanted to make those them suffer in every way I could\--and you can\'t
understand this because it's a realm of reality that you're not familiar
with. If I had more bullets I would have shot them all again and again.
My problem was I ran out of bullets. Do I have to go this route? Do do
do you want to hear it one more time?

Braver: What?

Goetz:The whole story?

Braver: We'd love to this way we could satisfy\...

Goetz: Okay, I just want to give a little background about me and
violence.

Braver: Sure.

Goetz: Okay, start with I'm\...I'm no nice guy you're going to be able
to drag me through the dirt, I don't care about that. I've got plenty of
faults,\...Several years ago I got, ah, I got jumped about 2:30 on Canal
Street\--2:30 in the afternoon during the week. I was jumped by three
guys, now. They deliberately went after my knee and they got it. Like,
ah, like I got kicked in the knee and then, and then, and what hurts you
is that they didn't have weapons and people you don't have to maimed
with a weapon what what really, what really, hurts you is is the
sidewalk. They tried to push me through a plate glass door and I'm in
good physical shape\--I\... I can do, you know, push-ups standing on my
hands. I pushed as hard as I could and when I hit that door I still hit
that door so hard, that door with my hands, I still hit that door so
hard\--the glass. the glass hard\--the glass didn't break, thank God,
you know because that that that would have been it, but the, but the,
handle\--yeah, yeah, yeah, the handle\--it it hit my chest and and
afterwards now I\...I\...I was a wreck. I was hyper in\...in\...in
hyperactivity for about four days after that. I went up to Connecticut
to work and everything and four days later I check into a emergency room
and my chest was messed up. It took about six months to heal and I had a
bad knee\--a permanent bad knee from that. Since then, since then, prior
to this incident I was, I was, attacked, I was attacked. The next day I
was carrying I was carrying a gun. Now this particular incident I\...I
was in the middle of a project. I got disgusted with it. I was working
on a piece of equipment. I said well I better take a break. I\...I went
downtown. I got on the train. When,when, the first, the fellow, one of
the fellows who was lying down there were four fellows in there. He lied
down, and he and he was lying down and, ah, he looked at me and said,
"How are you doing?"

Clark: What were you feeling when he said how were you doing? What were
you thinking then? What was your impression of how are you doing? What,
what were you feeling?

Goetz: These were just kids kidding around.

Clark: Okay\....

Goetz: That's\...that's\...that's\...that's all. It could have just been
kids kidding around but but it's just a possible warning, just a
possible warning. It\...it is wasn't even a possible warning, it was a
prime but then two of them stood up\--okay\--and they walked over to my
left, okay. Now there were two of them to my right and and and two on my
left. Now, I\...I\...I knew at that point I would have to pull the gun.
I'm, going say this. At that time I was going to pull the gun. But I
wasn't going to kill them. And that's what I wound\--what I wound up
trying to do, but I had no intention of killing them at that time.

Clark: Well, what was your intention?

Goetz: Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. What my intention was at
that time was just to follow the situation as closely as I could. The
one on my left, he asked me, he didn't ask me\...What he according to
the papers he asked me, "Give me five dollars"\--and he said it with a
smile and his eyes were bright. I knew I had to pull the gun, but it was
the look. And now you cannot understand this. It was, it was, it was,
his eyes were shiney. He had a smile on his face. I saw the smile on his
face and and and the shine, the shine is his eyes, that he was enjoying
this. I knew what they were going to do. Do you understand? Okay, do you
understand now? At that point, now. For combat you have to be cold
blooded and I was. And it was at that point I decided to kill them after
all, murder them all, do anything.

Braver: What did you think they were going to do?

Goetz: Laughing...How can you ask a question like that? What what what
they were going to do is they were going to they were going to have fun
with me with me, Miss.

Brabver: What do you mean by that?

Goetz: What do you mean?

Braver: What is your interpretation of that? I can't get inside your
head.

Goetz: Beat the shit out of you. What they were going to do was is is
enjoy me for awhile. They were going to beat the fucking shit out of me,
okay.

Clark: Did you feel trapped?

Goetz: Did I feel? What do you think? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I felt
free, I felt free. You know I was enjoying Fun City.

Clark: I see what you were felt at the time.

Goetz: I was just whistling Dixie, okay? I was in fear. And that's good,
because that helps that helps you think. That helps you think. But when
I saw his eyes, up to that point my state of mind changed and you go
through a different state of mind where reality totally totally changes.
So I had my pattern of flight laid out. It was obvious and what you do
is is is you don't think. You just, you don't think, just act. Speed is
everything, speed is everything. You just think of speed and the count.
You don't need verification. When he said, "Give me five dollars," I
pulled out the piece I just started firing. Now its\...its\...its on
point to look at what your firing at. You just target images in your
mind. You aim for the center of the mass, you keep moving. All you have
to do is be ah\...ah faster than they are. Now, perhaps they're, you
don't know what is happening on your right hand side, but it doesn't
matter. You do what you have do as quickly as possible. You don't think.
You live you live for the fraction of the moment to the
fraction\...fraction of the moment. The ah\...the ah\...the ah\...the
the you just react, you just react, you forget everything that happened
the instant before and you site. You don't understand: I'm explaining

target. That was number one, I got rid of number one. Got number two.

Got rid of number two. They say I shot him in the back. That doesn't
even matter. I wasn't even aiming for the back. You aim for the center.
One of the fellows looked like he was trying\...I\...I\...I\...I don't
know. I don't know if he was facing from the front or the back,
whatever. But it seemed as if he was trying to get through the steel
wall of the subway car. But he couldn't. I let him have it and I let of
the other guys have it. The one who that was pretending he wasn't with
them, and I ran up to the first two to check them. Who were on the
ground. The first two that I had shot and they were taken care of. It
was all very cold-blooded, Miss. And this is going to offend everyone.
And I went back to the other two to check on them. I wanted to know if I
had missed and I, but I\...I\...I\...I went to them a second time and I
looked at him and\--he can't verify this because he was probably out of
it by then, if I shot him or not, I don't know\--and I said, "You seem
to be doing all right, here's another."

People are looking for a hero or they are looking for a villain. And
neither is...neither is nothing is the truth. What you have
here\...here\...what you have here is nothing more...What you have here
is nothing more than a vicious rat. That's all it is is. It's not Clint
Eastwood. It's not...its not taking the law in your own hands. You can
label that. It's not being judge, judge, jury and executioner.

Clark: Bernard, can we get back...

Goetz: What this is\--what this is, what this is\--listen, I\'m going to
tell you what this is, and you won\'t understand. This is\--this is,
this is\--survival instinct, okay? And\...and\...and you can condemn it
all you want. I\...I\...I\...I\...I\...I\...just don\'t care

Florida Statute on Justifiable Use of Force

 

CHAPTER 776

JUSTIFIABLE USE OF FORCE

776.012 Use or threatened use of force in defense of person.---

(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except
deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person
reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or
herself or another against the other's imminent use of unlawful force. A
person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this
subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening
to use such force.

(2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if
he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such
force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to
himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a
forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in
accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has
the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening
to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in
a place where he or she has a right to be.

Markovitz on George Zimmerman & Bernie Goetz

 

**Excerpts from Jonathan Markovitz, [\"A Spectacle of Slavery Unwilling
to Die\": Curbing Reliance on Racial Stereotyping in Self-Defense
Cases]{.underline}, 5 UC Irvine L. Rev. 873, 877--82 (2015)**

 

In the early evening of February 26, 2012, George Zimmerman, a volunteer
neighborhood watch captain, noticed a Black teenager walking in a gated
community in Sanford, Florida. Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, who
was in town to visit his father and had just purchased candy and iced
tea at a nearby convenience store, was in the middle of a cell phone
conversation when he aroused Zimmerman\'s interest. Zimmerman called the
Sanford Police Department, relayed his suspicions, said that Martin was
running, and was advised not to follow him. This was the fifth time that
Zimmerman had called the police to report Black men travelling on foot
in the neighborhood in recent days. Within minutes, a neighbor called
the police to report hearing screams. Screaming could be heard in the
background of the 911 call, followed by the sound of a gunshot.

When the paramedics arrived, they pronounced Trayvon Martin dead at the
scene. Martin was killed by a single gunshot to the chest. George
Zimmerman, who had suffered head injuries at some point before the
arrival of the police, told the police that he and Martin had been
involved in a physical altercation, and that he shot Martin in
self-defense. He was taken into custody and released approximately five
hours later, without being arrested. The lead homicide investigator in
the case recommended charging Zimmerman, but was overruled by the
state\'s attorney general who explained that there was insufficient
evidence to convict. Martin\'s father was not informed of the death
until 9:20 a.m. the following morning.

The case lent urgency to a national debate about racial profiling, which
was already in the media spotlight because of a series of dramatic
protests surrounding  the New York City Police Department\'s "stop and
frisk" policies. Martin was shot while wearing a hooded sweatshirt (a
"hoodie"), and after Geraldo Rivera used his platform on Fox News to
indict Martin\'s "thug wear," suggesting that Martin\'s sartorial
choices were responsible for his death, hoodies became a symbol of
national protest. There were "million hoodie marches" involving
thousands of participants throughout the spring of 2012. In late March,
Democratic Congressman (and former Black Panther) Bobby Rush of Chicago
was ejected from the House floor for wearing a hoodie during a floor
speech. A YouTube video of the ejection received more than 600,000
views. Several days later, members of the Black, Latino, and Asian
Pacific Islander Caucuses wore hoodies during a session of the
California legislature, while protesting the killing and calling on the
federal government to intervene in the investigation.

But in the weeks that followed Martin\'s death, it was not the killing
alone, but also the decision not to arrest or prosecute Zimmerman that
aroused national outrage and elevated the case to the status of a cause
célèbre. Media attention to the case prompted Democratic members of the
U.S. House of Representatives to hold a forum on racial profiling and
hate crime prosecution, while more than 2 million people signed a
petition on the website change.org calling for Zimmerman\'s prosecution.
The call was eventually answered. On March 20, 2012, the U.S. Department
of Justice announced an investigation into the case, and on March 22,
the Sanford chief of police stepped aside as the Florida Governor
appointed a special prosecutor. The following day, President Obama
responded to a question about the case by discussing the urgent need to
"get to the bottom of exactly what happened," and saying "\[i\]f I had a
son, he\'d look like Trayvon." On April 11, 2012, George Zimmerman was
charged with second-degree murder and turned himself in.

Zimmerman\'s trial began on June 24, 2013. The case once again attracted
national and international attention, placing issues of race and
self-defense under the media spotlight throughout the trial\'s
three-week duration. While Zimmerman was initially charged only with
second-degree murder, jurors were also given instructions on
manslaughter at the trial\'s conclusion. Zimmerman was acquitted on July
13, 2013. The acquittal sparked another round of protests around the
country.  . . . On February 24, 2015, the Justice Department announced
that it would not prosecute Zimmerman, citing "insufficient evidence."

...

the most important way that stand your ground laws change self-defense
requirements is that they expand the protections given to potential
self-defense defendants. Under most stand your ground laws, self-defense
is not simply an affirmative defense to be argued at trial, but can
instead become a bar to prosecution. The Florida statute grants immunity
from criminal prosecution or civil liability to anyone using deadly
force under the law. This immunity applies even if the person using
deadly force was the initial aggressor, as long as that person is
responding to force that "is so great that the person reasonably
believes that he or she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily
harm and . . . has exhausted every reasonable means" to escape that
danger or has withdrawn from physical contact with the assailant and has
indicated a desire to withdraw and terminate the use of force.

The immunity provisions in the Florida statute take effect from the
moment that the police become involved in a case. Immunity from
prosecution "includes arresting, detaining in custody, and charging or
prosecuting the defendant." Moreover, the statute specifies that a
suspect cannot be arrested unless there is probable cause that the use
of force was unlawful. This is true in any self-defense case, since it
is a basic Fourth Amendment requirement that there can be no arrest
without probable cause. But making this explicit in the law, when it is
generally not explicit in other criminal statutes, suggests that violent
crimes committed in the name of self-defense are to be treated
differently than other crimes. The exact nature of the difference is,
however, open to debate.

...

Ultimately, the Trayvon Martin case aroused national ire because, at
crucial moments, key actors within the criminal justice system appeared
all too willing to accept that George Zimmerman had reasonable fear
coupled with a reasonable belief that it was necessary to use lethal
force against an unarmed seventeen-year-old boy. To many observers,
there seemed to be three different ways that racial bias had entered
into the proceedings. First, Zimmerman\'s personal fears appeared to
have been steeped in racial stereotypes of African American men, rather
than based on a reasonable assessment of the situation. His fear,
endorsed by some prominent pundits, seemed not to have been reasonable
at all. Nor did his actions, which included pursuing Martin after being
advised not to by a 911 dispatcher. In short, the killing appeared to
have been the result of an ill-advised and semivigilante form of racial
profiling. Second, and arguably more importantly, the initial decision
not to arrest or prosecute Zimmerman was understood to mean that the
legal system was sanctioning his fears and actions, thereby endorsing
the very stereotypes that Zimmerman relied upon and sending a message
that devalued Black life. Finally, as Zimmerman\'s defense team worked
to convince an almost all-white jury that Zimmerman\'s actions were
borne out of reasonable fear, it relied upon a series of well-worn
racial tropes to present a seventeen-year-old boy as a monstrously
brutal thug. The central issues in the case, therefore, were not about
stand-your-ground legislation itself. Instead, the case raised the
questions of what it means to allow a suspect to claim self-defense when
his or her fear or actions may have been shaped by racist stereotypes,
and of how racial bias may affect the self-defense determinations of a
range of legal actors.

...

\[W\]hen \[Bernie Goetz's\] case finally went to the jury, media
coverage consistently suggested that race had played no role in the
trial. And it is true that race was never explicitly discussed during
the proceedings. However, it is possible to rely upon racial stereotypes
without using the language of race, and Goetz\'s legal team took full
advantage of racially charged imagery and code words.

Barry Slotnick, Goetz\'s attorney, regularly portrayed Goetz\'s victims
in animalistic terms, referring to them as "vultures" and "predators,"
while suggesting that Goetz had acted in defense not only of self, but
also of civilization itself, taking aim not at a group of teenagers, but
at the "savages" whose potential for violence needed no explanation.
More dramatically, Slotnick staged a reenactment of the events leading
up to the shooting, and relied on human props to highlight the sense of
danger that Goetz claimed to have felt. . . . Slotnick had "four young
black Guardian Angels, fit and muscular, dressed in T-shirts" stand in
for Goetz\'s victims. . . . The absence of any open discussion of race
may have made Slotnick\'s theatrical display more effective, since it
meant that there was never any debate about the racial underpinnings of
the staging. Additionally, it is possible that jurors who may have
recoiled at explicit verbal invocations of racist stereotypes were
instead quietly swayed by more covert and unacknowledged reliance upon
the same types of racist imagery that were ubiquitous outside the
courtroom walls, in popular culture and even within daily news coverage
of the trial.

Nearly thirty years later, similar dynamics were at play as defense
attorney Mark O\'Mara presented his closing arguments in the murder
trial of George Zimmerman. In an attempt to portray Trayvon Martin as a
powerful threat, O\'Mara displayed a shirtless photograph of Martin,
directing the jury\'s gaze toward Martin\'s  physique. O\'Mara explained
that while the jury had already seen Martin\'s body in autopsy
photographs, such photographs are presented to juries for emotional
appeal. They are

*"horrific, and they\'re meant to have negative impact. I did it when I
was a prosecutor. Prosecutors do it all the time. A dead person on a
slab has an impact on you. . . . The other thing about autopsy
photographs is that there\'s no muscle tone because there\'s no nerves,
there\'s no movement . . . on that picture that we have of him on the
medical examiner\'s table, yeah, he does look emaciated. But here\'s him
three months before that night. So it\'s in evidence, take a look at it.
Because this is the person . . . who George Zimmerman encountered that
night. This is the person who . . . attacked George Zimmerman, who broke
his nose or something close to it, and battered him on something."*

O\'Mara then displayed a photograph illustrating how dark it was on the
night of Martin\'s death. He told the jury that "it was out of this
darkness that Trayvon Martin decided to stalk, I guess, plan, pounce, I
don\'t know, all I know is that when George Zimmerman was walking back
to his car, out of the darkness, be it bushes or darkness or left or
behind or somewhere, Trayvon Martin came towards George Zimmerman. Out
of this \[O\'Mara shakes photo of dark area\] and we know what happened.
The big picture is what happened.

As with the use of the Guardian Angels in the trial of Bernhard Goetz,
there is nothing about the use of the shirtless photograph of Trayvon
Martin that is explicitly racialized. Certainly, O\'Mara said nothing
about race as he displayed the photograph. On the other hand, O\'Mara\'s
decision to highlight and then cast away images of Martin\'s
vulnerability while lingering on his musculature fits into a long
history of racialized narratives and imagery that entail reducing Black
men to nothing more than brute physicality.

...

Self-defense cases represent only one small area of the law in which
determinations of what counts as reasonable fear, suspicion, or force
can be shaped by reliance on racist belief systems.

an opinion.

## \[504\] HOPKINS, J. P.

The defendant has been convicted of escape in the second degree. He
claims that Criminal Term erroneously excluded evidence which he was
prepared to submit in the form of testimony which would have
substantiated his defenses of justification and duress. In short, the
defendant argues that his evidence would have shown the escape was
motivated because of threats on his life made by prison guards and other
inmates, and because conditions in the prison were intolerable, thus
vitiating the criminal intent which is an essential ingredient of the
crime of escape in the second degree.

We affirm. The evidence tendered by the defendant would not have met the
statutory standards established for the maintenance of the defenses of
justification and duress, and Criminal Term was therefore correct in
rejecting the proof.

## I

On April 18, 1973 the defendant was committed to the Brooklyn House of
Detention under an indictment charging him with murder. He had been
brought to New York from Missouri where he had been serving a sentence
of imprisonment for a term of 25 years for a conviction of assault with
intent to kill. On September 27, 1973 the defendant was sent under guard
to the Kings County Hospital for treatment of a possible ulcer. At the
hospital the defendant was escorted to the X-ray department in the
out-patient building.

The defendant\'s handcuffs were removed and the defendant undressed,
donned a hospital gown and was X-rayed. He was then returned to the
dressing booth. Hearing the door slam, the guards opened the booth to
find the defendant gone. The guards were told that the defendant had
been seen outside the building and gave chase. The pursuit was
unsuccessful. The defendant was not apprehended until October 3, 1973.

The defendant was thereafter indicted for escape in the second degree.

## \[505\] II

At the trial the defendant made several offers of proof. First, the
defendant stated that Pedro Monges, a fellow prisoner, would testify
that he had first met the defendant in the Brooklyn House of Detention
and had heard the defendant\'s life threatened by prison guards on
numerous occasions; that he knew that the defendant had gone to the
hospital for medical treatment; and that the defendant had complained
about pains in his chest caused by the
threats.[^\[1\]^](#Xdfcffc2dcbdbedbae057c37dfb3e89a6b9f2c76)

Second, the defendant stated that Paul Gulielmetti, a lawyer, would
testify that he had acted as attorney for the plaintiffs in litigation
involving conditions in the Brooklyn House of Detention, in which
certain improvements had been directed by the
court.[^\[2\]^](#Xd77f1a5042a5df26e82f26af88282c05e43dd4f)

\[506\] Third, the defendant stated that Stephen
Lapimer,[^\[3\]^](#X0e501d2f9ce5fd3064b4adfb9a7cd6d24d7fb53) a lawyer,
would testify that he also had conducted litigation challenging
conditions in the Brooklyn House of Detention, and that he had heard the
Judge officiating in the litigation say that conditions in the prison
were such as to lead to attempts to
escape.[^\[4\]^](#X0d93e72cf03acf232a78c442dc0062647f34d37)

Fourth, the defendant stated that Dan Pachoda, a lawyer, would testify
that he had been associated with Mr. Gulielmetti in litigation relating
to the Brooklyn House of Detention, some of which actions had been
successful.[^\[5\]^](#X7e126f16e9af9d0dcf224a1c7aaf3e0ca13a737)

Fifth, the defendant stated that Melvin Haywood, a lawyer, would testify
that he had visited the Brooklyn House of Detention and was familiar
with the actions in which conditions there had been
challenged.[^\[6\]^](#X7aef0d0cbcf26f2f474c6cc62b2f7893aab4d06)

Sixth, the defendant stated that Doctor Michael Smith, a psychiatrist,
would testify that the effect of threats against an individual would
result in personal stress, lowering the \"individual\'s voluntariness
with respect to his
actions.\"[^\[7\]^](#X3e9e735f109fb1e244b6a8f9ae023e2f68dc067)

\[507\] The Criminal Term sustained the prosecution\'s objections to the
offer of proof, holding that the proof was irrelevant to the issue of
guilt. In effect, the court ruled that neither fear arising from threats
nor intolerable prison conditions constituted defenses to the crime of
escape.

The defendant, however, was permitted to introduce evidence through a
doctor\'s testimony that the defendant was suffering from chronic
gastritis and had suffered from peptic ulcers. The doctor further
testified that stress was a contributing factor in the development of an
ulcer. The defendant himself testified that in 1971 he had been treated
for stomach ailments and had complained of an ulcer in 1972 while in
prison in Missouri. He further testified that as a result of his
complaints in New York he had seen the prison doctor and finally had
been sent to Kings County Hospital for X-ray examination. He admitted
that he had escaped from custody during the time of that medical
procedure.

Criminal Term refused to admit testimony of the defendant under an offer
of proof to the effect that the police officer assigned to bring the
defendant from Missouri to New York had pointed his revolver at him on
several occasions and told him that he did not deserve to
live.[^\[8\]^](#Xf26984f1169fbd3b106784b255ad5f653abc464)

The defendant excepted to the failure of the court to charge \[508\]
justification as a defense and specifically to the failure to charge
that if the jury found that the defendant\'s escape was an effort to
protect himself from imminent personal harm, then the jury should find
that the defendant did not possess the criminal intent to commit the
crime of escape.

## III

Section 35.05 of the Penal Law, so far as pertinent, reads:

> \"Unless otherwise limited by the ensuing provisions of this article
> defining justifiable use of physical force, conduct which would
> otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:
> \* \* \*
>
> \"2. Such conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an
> imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of
> a situation occasioned or developed through no fault of the actor, and
> which is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of
> intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding
> such injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury
> sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue.
> The necessity and justifiability of such conduct may not rest upon
> considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the
> statute, either in its general application or with respect to its
> application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder.
> Whenever evidence relating to the defense of justification under this
> subdivision is offered by the defendant, the court shall rule as a
> matter of law whether the claimed facts and circumstances would, if
> established, constitute a defense.\"

This provision was derived from section 3.02 of the Model Penal Code and
enters an area of criminal behavior not previously the subject of
legislation in the law of New York. It is, as a commentator has said, a
doctrine in substance recognizing and weighing a \"choice of evils\"
presented by unusual situations \"in which some compelling circumstance
or \`emergency\' warrants deviation from the general rule that
transgression of the criminal law will not be tolerated\" (Hechtman,
Practice Commentaries, McKinney\'s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law,
§ 35.05, p 83). To put it more concretely, the statute authorizes the
defense of justification --- or necessity, as it sometimes is called ---
in a limited number of cases where conduct otherwise condemned is found
necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private
injury about to occur through no fault of the actor, and the impending
\[509\] injury is of such gravity that the desirability and urgency of
avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the objectives of the statute
condemning the conduct (cf. *People v Bieniek*, 60 AD2d 777; *People v
Brown*, 70 Misc 2d 224, 227-228 \[BIRNS, J.\]).

Whether conditions in a prison may ever justify a defense to the crime
of escape is a question expressly left open by the Court of Appeals in
*People v Barkman* (34 N.Y.2d 624, 626). In *Barkman* the issue was not
reached because the defendants had not made an offer of proof following
a colloquy in which the trial court had said that it would not admit
proof of conditions of the jail in support of a defense of
justification. However, the Court of Appeals noted that the defendants
had referred to the conditions only in general terms, without giving
details or particulars concerning the conditions claimed to underlie and
support the defense. Hence, the Court of Appeals held that \"\[w\]ithout
at least such a tender of proof we do not reach the question whether
conditions or treatment in a correctional facility can ever constitute
proof of justification as a defense to the crime of escape\" (*People v
Barkman*, *supra*, p 626).

## IV

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

## V

*O*ur statute must be the final bench mark in assessing the defendant\'s
conduct and his offer of \[511\] proof. In addressing the ultimate
question of the validity of the defense of justification, we confront
initially, whether, as broached under *People v Barkman* (34 N.Y.2d 624,
*supra*), section 35.05 of the Penal Law ever authorizes the defense in
a prosecution for the crime of escape. Second, assuming that inquiry is
answered affirmatively, we must then consider whether the defendant\'s
offer of proof fell within the statute.

In examining the statute vis-à-vis the crime of escape, we observe at
once that it is not limited in scope to particular criminal conduct, for
the statute reads generally that \"conduct which would otherwise
constitute an offense is justifiable \* \* \* when\" (Penal Law, §
35.05). The thrust of the statute is rather directed toward a situation
occurring through no fault of the defendant, and the desirability and
urgency of avoiding an imminent public or private injury overbalance the
desirability of avoiding the injury which is contemplated by a violation
of the statute for which the defendant is being prosecuted. In a broad
sense, then, we think that a defendant prosecuted for escape from a
penal institution can raise the defense of justification if in fact the
escape was compelled by the existence of conditions posing an imminent
danger of personal injury to the prisoner, which cannot be avoided by
the defendant through resort to the authorities or other legal means.

We entertain no doubt that a convict, punished by imprisonment for the
commission of a crime, is under a continuing duty to serve his sentence
without resort to disorder or surreptitious attempts to escape; and
under our system of justice it is socially desirable that a person found
guilty of a crime be incarcerated for the period of time set by law as a
form of punishment for his misdeed. At the same time, our system
recognizes that if the imprisonment imposed on the convict suffers the
existence of conditions beyond the bounds of the law, so that the
convict is subjected to brutal and intolerable measures or to the danger
of imminent personal injury, either from the prison guards or from other
inmates, without hope of relief after reasonable appeals to the
authorities, then the prisoner may claim justification for an escape if
he thereafter surrenders to custody within a reasonably prompt time, and
the defendant\'s proof must be submitted to the jury. Brutality in the
treatment of a prisoner is not sanctioned simply because the prisoner
was sentenced to imprisonment for the commission of a crime.

\[512\] Nonetheless, there are prescriptions in the statute which must
be emphasized. It provides that imminent personal injury must be present
before justification may be pleaded as a defense to a criminal act.
Conditions in a prison may be crowded or unsanitary and yet not pose
imminent danger to those confined. Relief from these conditions may be
sought by the prisoner through appropriate legal action in the courts
(see, e.g., *Wilkinson v Skinner*, 34 N.Y.2d 53, 59; *Matter of*
*Brabson v Wilkins*, 45 Misc 2d 286, mod 25 AD2d 610, affd 19 N.Y.2d
433; *Commonwealth ex rel. Bryant v Hendrick*, 444 Pa 83; *Coffin v
Reichard*, 143 F.2d 443; cf. *Woodhous v Virginia*, 487 F.2d 889; *Perez
v Turner*, 462 F.2d 1056, cert den 410 US 944; see, generally, Turner,
When Prisoners Sue: A Study of Prisoner Section 1983 Suits in the
Federal Courts, 92 Harv L Rev 610). Indeed, the offer of proof made by
the defendant included references to pending court proceedings
concerning conditions in the institution where the defendant was
confined. If, in contrast to the existence of unhealthful conditions
generally in the prison, the prisoner\'s personal safety is threatened
to the point of imminent injury and no other means of relief is
reasonably available, the prisoner\'s escape to avoid the injury would
constitute justification under the statute. Even in this extreme case,
however, the prisoner should, as soon as possible, make known his
presence and surrender to the law enforcement authorities (*United
States v Michelson*, 559 F.2d 567, 570, *supra*).

Having determined in the affirmative the initial query whether an escape
under any circumstances may be justified, we turn to the second query
whether the defendant\'s offer of proof in this case was sufficient. We
think that it was not. In the first place, the defendant remained at
liberty from September 27, 1973, the date of his escape, to October 3,
1973, when he was apprehended, without any endeavor by him to return to
custody. Moreover, his escape was not from the prison but from a
hospital where he was undergoing treatment for an ailment; at the time
it is clear that he was not under any imminent danger of personal
injury. Beyond this, his offer of proof of threats in prison by prison
guards was not specific as to individuals making the threats or time;
and the proof that a detective bringing him to New York had threatened
his life did not establish imminent danger, as the threat allegedly
occurred in April, 1973 and the escape occurred some five months later.
The offer of proof relating to the \[513\] existence of litigation
challenging the conditions in Brooklyn House of Detention could not
serve as a ground justifying escape, since in itself such legal
proceedings did not establish imminent danger to the defendant, but
rather proved the existence and use of remedies to correct such
conditions. Finally, the offer of proof of psychiatric testimony
concerning pressure on an individual confined under unhealthful prison
conditions to escape from prison in our judgment does not satisfy the
tests which the defense of justification demands. It is the presence of
intolerable conditions and threats of imminent danger which establishes
the defense, and the defense of justification implies stress on the
prisoner arising from those conditions, without the need of psychiatric
testimony.

We find, therefore, that the defendant\'s offer of proof was properly
excluded.

## VI

The defendant also urges that his escape was excused by duress. Our
statute permits the defense of duress in the following language (Penal
Law, § 40.00): \"1. In any prosecution for an offense, it is an
affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct
because he was coerced to do so by the use or threatened imminent use of
unlawful physical force upon him or a third person, which force or
threatened force a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would
have been unable to resist.\"

We do not think that the circumstances of this case, even viewed in the
light of the testimony offered to be proved, give rise to the defense of
duress under the
statute.[^\[9\]^](#X7daa9f578daa48dce452ec6f3fe64e0a0620f03) There was
no physical force exercised on the defendant at the time of the escape,
nor was there a threat of imminent use of physical force on the
defendant at the time of the escape. The defendant fled from a hospital
where he had gone to receive treatment. Duress in the sense of the
statute means immediate physical force or immediate threat of physical
force. It may not be used as a defense when the force or threat is
incapable of immediate exercise of realization.

## \[514\] VII

Consequently, we hold that the defendant\'s conviction must stand, and
that Criminal Term was not in error in excluding the defendant\'s offer
of proof.

## SUOZZI, J. (dissenting).

I vote to reverse the judgment of conviction and grant defendant a new
trial.

**\[ ... \]**

I disagree with the majority\'s conclusion that defendant\'s offer of
proof on the defense of justification was properly excluded as being
insufficient as a matter of law.

As part of his offer of proof, defense counsel indicated that he would
introduce testimony from a fellow inmate who was present when numerous
threats were made on defendant\'s life by prison guards during the
period commencing April 18, 1973, when defendant was committed to the
Brooklyn House of Detention under an indictment charging him with
murder, and September 27, 1973, when defendant was sent to Kings County
Hospital (due to a possible ulcer), from whence he escaped on that very
date.

In view of the fact, as the majority itself concedes, that an escape
from prison may be justified in certain situations, it is clear that the
defendant\'s offer of proof was of sufficient particularity to raise a
genuine factual issue with regard to the defense of justification which
could only be resolved upon submission to the jury.

Judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County, rendered May 30, 1975,
affirmed.

Tennessee v. Garner

 

Supreme Court of the United States

No. 83-1035

**\[ ... \]**

This case requires us to determine the constitutionality of the use of
deadly force to prevent the escape of an apparently unarmed suspected
felon. **\[ ... \]**

I

At about 10:45 p. m. on October 3, 1974, Memphis Police Officers Elton
Hymon and Leslie Wright were dispatched to answer a "prowler inside
call." Upon arriving at the scene they saw a woman standing on her porch
and gesturing toward the adjacent house.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe39e4fbf4149374901e8d7ca4cdede5c5d0373f)She told them she had
heard glass breaking and that "they" or "someone" was breaking in next
door. While Wright radioed the dispatcher to say that they were on the
scene, Hymon went behind the house. He heard a door slam and saw someone
run across the backyard. The fleeing suspect, who was
appellee-respondent's decedent, Edward Garner, stopped at a 6-feet-high
chain link fence at the edge of the yard. With the aid of a flashlight,
Hymon was able to see Garner's face and hands. He saw no sign of a
weapon, and, though not certain, was "reasonably sure" and "figured"
that Garner was unarmed. **\[ ... \]**He thought Garner was 17 or 18
years old and about 5\' 5\" *or 5\'* 7\" tall.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X711b61b6058c1cac69bb46db095038f224316fe)While Garner was
crouched at the base of the fence, Hymon called out "police, halt" and
took a few steps toward him. Garner then began to climb over the fence.
Convinced that if Garner made it over the fence he would elude
capture,[**\[ ... \]**](#Xc8b6e9f01b75ec871ccea2b65769a6aa06226dc)Hymon
shot him. The bullet hit Garner in the back of the head. Garner was
taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he died on the operating table.
Ten dollars and a purse taken from the house were found on his
body.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xae5a7c943a17c22d9eca1e2c4c41042a4aa7052)

In using deadly force to prevent the escape, Hymon was acting under the
authority of a Tennessee statute and pursuant to Police Department
policy. The statute provides that "\[i\]f, after notice of the intention
to arrest the defendant, he either flee or forcibly resist, the officer
may use all the necessary means to effect the arrest." Tenn. Code Ann.
§40-7-108 (1982).[**\[ ...
\]**](#X7380e745a59f8b0a6895d1bfcee3fe60102c969)The Department policy
was slightly more restrictive than the statute, but still allowed the
use of deadly force in cases of burglary. **\[ ... \]**The incident was
reviewed by the Memphis Police Firearm's Review Board and presented to a
grand jury. Neither took any action. **\[ ... \]**

Garner's father then brought this action in the Federal District Court
**\[ ... \]**seeking damages **\[ ... \]** for asserted violations of
Garner's constitutional rights. **\[ ... \]***The* District Court
entered judgment for all defendants. **\[ ... \]**

The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. **\[ ... \]**It reasoned
that the killing of a fleeing suspect is a "seizure" under the Fourth
Amendment,[**\[ ... \]**](#X14466707de3babc28bb34185d4bcfb88f6ed585)and
is therefore constitutional only if "reasonable." **\[ ... \]**

The State of Tennessee, which had intervened to defend the statute, **\[
... \]** appealed to this Court. **\[ ... \]**

A

A police officer may arrest a person if he has probable cause to believe
that person committed a crime. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** *\[N\]otwithstanding* probable cause to seize a suspect,
an officer may not always do so by killing him. The intrusiveness of a
seizure by means of deadly force is unmatched. The suspect's fundamental
interest in his own life need not be elaborated upon. The use of deadly
force also frustrates the interest of the individual, and of society, in
judicial determination of guilt and punishment. Against these interests
are ranged governmental interests in effective law enforcement.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X2109ded0042c2885c306f0895f46a442fde2cbb)It is argued that
overall violence will be reduced by encouraging the peaceful submission
of suspects who know that they may be shot if they flee. Effectiveness
in making arrests requires the resort to deadly force, or at least the
meaningful threat thereof. "Being able to arrest such individuals is a
condition precedent to the state's entire system of law enforcement."
**\[ ... \]**

Without in any way disparaging the importance of these goals, we are not
convinced that the use of deadly force is a sufficiently productive
means of accomplishing them to justify the killing of nonviolent
suspects. **\[ ... \]**The use of deadly force is a self-defeating way
of apprehending a suspect and so setting the criminal justice mechanism
in motion. If successful, it guarantees that that mechanism will not be
set in motion. And while the meaningful threat of deadly force might be
thought to lead to the arrest of more live suspects by discouraging
escape attempts,[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xbc1a326b2f5a30e673e196b5f32fc96e0b40684)the presently available
evidence does not support this thesis.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd35e1339cc72611666df33fa61127a8b39b1754)The fact is that a
majority of police departments in this country have forbidden the use of
deadly force against nonviolent suspects.**\[ ... \]** *\[T\]here* is a
substantial basis for doubting that the use of such force is an
essential attribute of the arrest power in all felony cases. **\[ ...
\]**

It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.
Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat
to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not
justify the use of deadly force to do so. **\[ ... \]** A police officer
may not seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead. The
Tennessee statute is unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes the use
of deadly force against such fleeing suspects.

It is not, however, unconstitutional on its face. Where the officer has
probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious
physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not
constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.
Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is
probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the
infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly
force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if, where
feasible, some warning has been given. As applied in such circumstances,
the Tennessee statute would pass constitutional muster.

Ill

A

It is insisted that the Fourth Amendment must be construed in light of
the common-law rule, which allowed the use of whatever force was
necessary to effect the arrest of a fleeing felon, though not a
misdemeanant. **\[ ... \]**

B

It has been pointed out many times that the common-law rule is best
understood in light of the fact that it arose at a time when virtually
all felonies were punishable by death.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X5a560e4c50577ed17c6ce5525fb8822773ae42a) "Though effected
without the protections and formalities of an orderly trial and
conviction, the killing of a resisting or fleeing felon resulted in no
greater consequences than those authorized for punishment of the felony
of which the individual was charged or suspected." American Law
Institute, Model Penal Code §3.07, Comment 3, p. 56 (Tentative Draft No.
8, 1958) (hereinafter Model Penal Code Comment). Courts have also
justified the common-law rule by emphasizing the relative dangerousness
of felons. **\[ ... \]**

Neither of these justifications makes sense today. Almost all crimes
formerly punishable by death no longer are or can be. **\[ ... \]**And
while in earlier times "the gulf between the felonies and the minor
offences was broad and deep," **\[ ... \]** today the distinction is
minor and often arbitrary. Many crimes classified as misdemeanors**\[
... \]** at common law are now felonies. **\[ ... \]**These changes have
undermined the concept, which was questionable to begin with, that use
of deadly force against a fleeing felon is merely a speedier execution
of someone who has already forfeited his life. They have also made the
assumption that a "felon" is more dangerous than a misdemeanant
untenable. Indeed, numerous misdemeanors involve conduct more dangerous
than many felonies.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xb97768c561baed186502f6bee8a85022960e91e)

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Officer Hymon could not reasonably have believed that Garner --- young,
slight, and unarmed --- posed any threat. Indeed, Hymon never attempted
to justify his actions on any basis other than the need to prevent an
escape. The **\[ ... \]**fact that Garner was a suspected burglar could
not**\[ ... \]**automatically justify the use of deadly force. Hymon did
not have probable cause to believe that Garner, whom he correctly
believed to be unarmed, posed any physical danger to himself or others.

**\[ ... \]**Although the armed burglar would present a different
situation, the fact that an unarmed suspect has broken into a dwelling
at night does not automatically mean he is physically dangerous. **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Justice O'Connor,

with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

Without questioning the importance of a person's interest in his life, I
do not think this interest encompasses a right to flee unimpeded from
the scene of a burglary. **\[ ... \]**The legitimate interests of the
suspect in these circumstances are adequately accommodated by the
Tennessee statute: to avoid the use of deadly force and the consequent
risk to his life, the suspect need merely obey the valid order to halt.

**\[ ... \]**No one can view the death of an unarmed and apparently
nonviolent 15-year-old without sorrow, much less disapproval.
Nonetheless, the reasonableness of Officer Hymon's conduct **\[ ...
\]**cannot be evaluated by what later appears to have been a preferable
course of police action. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Whatever the constitutional limits on police use of deadly force in
order to apprehend a fleeing felon, I do not believe they are exceeded
in a case in which a police officer has probable cause to arrest a
suspect at the scene of a residential burglary, orders the suspect to
halt, and then fires his weapon as a last resort to prevent the
suspect's escape into the night. I respectfully dissent.

New York Penal Law § 40.05 Entrapment

 

In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that the
defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct because he was induced or
encouraged to do so by a public servant, or by a person acting in
cooperation with a public servant, seeking to obtain evidence against
him for purpose of criminal prosecution, and when the methods used to
obtain such evidence were such as to create a substantial risk that the
offense would be committed by a person not otherwise disposed to commit
it.  Inducement or encouragement to commit an offense means active
inducement or encouragement.  Conduct merely affording a person an
opportunity to commit an offense does not constitute entrapment.

2008-04-11

\[855 NYS2d 736\]

Stein, J.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano,
J.), rendered January 26, 2007, upon a verdict convicting defendant of
the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third
degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third
degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth
degree.

Defendant was arrested for the sale of cocaine to a confidential
informant. Thereafter, defendant was charged in a three-count indictment
with the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third
degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third
degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth
degree. Defendant sought to have the defenses of entrapment and agency
presented to the jury. County Court granted defendant's request only to
the extent of instructing the jury to consider the entrapment defense
with respect to counts one and two. The jury returned verdicts of guilty
on all counts and defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of
six years. Defendant now appeals.

**\[ ... \]**

County Court's refusal to charge the jury regarding an agency defense
was also proper. "An agency defense must be submitted to the jury if any
reasonable view of the evidence, considered in the light most favorable
to the defendant, supports the conclusion that the defendant, in selling
narcotics, was acting 'solely on behalf of the buyer such as to be a
mere extension or instrumentality of the buyer' " *(People v Magee,* 263
AD2d 763, 765 \[1999\], quoting *People v Ortiz,* 76 NY2d 446, 449
\[1990\]). "\[Wlhether a particular defendant has acted only as an agent
for the buyer is a factual question for the jury, which may consider
such factors as 'the nature and extent of the relationship between the
defendant and the buyer, \[which person\] suggested the purchase,
whether the defendant has had other drug dealings with this or other
buyers or sellers and . . . whether the defendant profited, or stood to
profit, from the transaction' " *(People v Ortiz,* 76 NY2d at 449,
quoting *People v Lam Lek Chong,* 45 NY2d 64, 75 \[1978\], *cert denied*
439 US 935 \[1978\]; *see People v Magee,* 263 AD2d at 765).

Here, defendant made a profit on, and benefitted from, the transaction.
Thus, even viewing the other testimony in the light most favorable to
defendant, we conclude that there is no reasonable view of the evidence
which would support the conclusion that defendant was acting merely as
an extension or instrumentality of the buyer *(see People v Ortiz,* 76
NY2d at 449). At best, he was an intermediary and, thus, the agency
defense was not implicated *(see People v Magee,* 263 AD2d at 765).

Likewise, in order to establish entitlement to an entrapment defense,
defendant must demonstrate that the evidence adduced at trial reasonably
and sufficiently supports an inference that "(1) he was actively induced
or encouraged to commit the offense by a public official; and (2) such
inducement or encouragement created a 'substantial risk' that the
offense would be committed by defendant who was not otherwise disposed
to commit it" *(People v Brown,* 82 NY2d 869, 871 \[1993\], quoting
Penal Law § 40.05). No reasonable view of the evidence presented here
supports entitlement to the defense for the charge of criminal
possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.[^24]
Defendant was admittedly a cocaine addict and regularly possessed
cocaine and, therefore, was otherwise disposed to commit the offense.
Accordingly, County Court did not err in refusing to give the charge
*(see People v Butts,* 72 NY2d 746, 751 \[1988\]).

**\[ ... \]**

We have examined the other issues raised by defendant and conclude that
they are meritless.

Cardona, P.J., Mercure, Spain and Malone Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that
the judgment is affirmed.

Lucky Bag articles

 

Please read these two news articles about the NYPD\'s \"Operation Lucky
Bag,\" one from 2006 and one from 2019. How do you imagine an Entrapment
defense might play out in these cases?

**CROOKS 'CARTED' OFF TO PRISON -- NYPD'S BAIT SNAGS THIEVES**

By Dan Mangan

Published Feb. 27, 2006, 5:00 a.m. ET

The bait is a cheap handcart (carrying groceries and \$5 in a purse left
on a subway platform.

Cops watch nearby, waiting for a would-be thief to snag the items.

It's a crafty ploy that netted 14 people in its first setup two weeks
ago. But while authorities crow that among those nabbed are many serial
criminals -- including one man previously busted 57 times -- critics
blast it as everything from entrapment to a costly example of wasted
police manpower.

Officials said those busted in Operation Lucky Bag face raps of petit
larceny and possession of stolen property, both misdemeanors. They
already had a total of 146 prior busts on their criminal records,
including grand larcenies, robberies and the attempted murder of a cop,
authorities said.

One man, 39-year-old Keith Myers of Brooklyn, previously was arrested 57
times for crimes including bank robbery and grand larceny. He also has a
pending drug rap against him.

When Myers was nabbed Feb. 16 outside a Jamaica subway station with his
"loot," he allegedly also was carrying hypodermic needles and spat in
the face of the arresting cop, Lt. Gary Abrahall.

"It has been a very successful program," said police spokesman Chief
Michael Collins. "The type of people we find who commit the larceny of
removing this bag we leave out are the type of people who are committing
all kinds of crimes."

But prominent criminal lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that police cannot induce someone to commit a crime
unless they have prior knowledge that that person is likely to commit a
crime.

"I don't think the government ought to be spending taxpayers' money to
induce citizens to commit crimes. There's plenty of things for them to
do without doing that," Lefcourt said.

One police source disgruntled with the program also blasted it a waste
of manpower.

The source said there were 10 cops -- one sergeant and nine officers --
involved in the Jamaica sting that nailed Myers and no other perps
during a three-hour surveillance.

The source suggested that Lucky Bag was cooked up by recently promoted
police Transit Chief James Hall to boost his division's arrest numbers.
"You don't get promoted through the ranks unless your numbers are better
than the other guy's," the source said.

An NYPD spokesman denied the claim.

 

\(2\) 2019:

**The NYPD Is Locking People Up for Crimes It Created Out of Thin Air**

Operation Lucky Bag targets people whose actions hurt absolutely no one.

By Joe Setyon, REASON, 2.4.2019

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is still trying to lure
unsuspecting residents into committing petty theft so it can lock them
up.

Operation Lucky Bag began in 2006, supposedly as a way for police to put
away people with existing rap sheets. Undercover officers would plant a
bag, usually with money or other valuables inside, in a public place.
They\'d wait for someone to \"steal\" the planted property then make an
arrest.

In other words, they were creating crimes out of thin air. If, indeed,
they were crimes at all. [Under state
law](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-252.html),
people who find property worth more than \$20 have 10 days to either
return it to the owner or give it up to police.

Unsurprisingly, the practice drew controversy. In 2013, several people
adversely affected by Operation Lucky
Bag [filed](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suit-targets-nypd-theft-trap-tactic-article-1.1349629) a
class-action lawsuit against the NYPD. The following September, the two
sides reached a settlement. The police clarified that \"a person picking
up property that they find cannot be charged with larceny simply because
they fail to return property to a police officer who is located near the
site at the time the property was found,\" according to a January 2015
operations order provided to *Reason* by an NYPD spokesperson. Arrests
can only be made if there is \"a separation of any valuables from the
rest of the property\" (i.e., if a person takes cash out of a planted
bag and discards the bag), if \"a larceny by trespassory taking has
occurred\" (i.e., if someone grabs a bag hanging from a stroller), or if
\"an individual has taken property but denies seeing or possessing the
property when approached by\" police.

But police are still able to fabricate crimes---crimes that hurt no
one---just so they can lock people up. Two recent cases illustrate the
absurdity of this tactic.

On December 14, police planted a backpack outside a Macy\'s department
store in Manhattan. The bag\'s contents included a laptop, an iPad, and
a wallet with \$40 in
it, [according](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-operation-lucky-bag-back-manhattan-20190202-story.html) to
the New York *Daily News*. A pedestrian, Tamarit Orquidea, noticed the
bag and picked it up. \"I would have taken it to the precinct down the
street from my house,\"
she [told](https://www.manhattantimesnews.com/stop-the-stingsalto-a-los-enganos/) the *Manhattan
Times* last month. Instead, she got arrested.

Police claim that Orquidea walked by a uniformed traffic cop while
carrying the bag and that she put the \$40 in her pocket. Whatever
Orquidea\'s true intentions were, she was not hurting anyone. Police had
no way of knowing what she was going to do with what she found, and
arresting her did nothing to help keep the streets safe.

The same can be said of Cinque Brown, who police entrapped using the
same bag roughly 30 minutes earlier. Brown picked the bag up and failed
to give it to a nearby traffic cop. He apparently decided not to and was
arrested as a result. Neither Orquidea nor Brown represented a menace to
society, but both were still charged, Orquidea with petty larceny and
Brown with petty larceny and possession of stolen property.

\"I just don\'t understand why this is still going on in this city---I
really don\'t,\" Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Melissa Crane said
during Brown\'s December 15 arraignment hearing.

Two nonprofit legal defense organizations---New York County Defender
Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society---tell the *Daily
News* they\'ve represented at least nine people entrapped by Operation
Lucky Bag in recent days.

I don\'t have the relevant data for the latest wave of arrests, but of
the first 220 people arrested after the program\'s implementation in
February 2006, [more than half did not have a prior criminal
record](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/28/nyregion/28about.html). The
alleged point of Operation Lucky Bag, you may recall, was to catch
repeat offenders.

conflicting views. Some believe fervently that a human person comes into
being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel
just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman's right
to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality.
Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed
under some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a
variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be
imposed.

For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each
State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views
of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this Court decided *Roe v. Wade*, 410
U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147. Even though the Constitution
makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad
right to obtain one. It did not claim that American law or the common
law had ever recognized such a right, and its survey of history ranged
from the constitutionally irrelevant (*e.g*., its discussion of abortion
in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (*e.g*., its assertion that
abortion was probably never a crime under the common law). After
cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the
meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set
of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a
legislature.

Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated
differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of
the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at
which a fetus was thought to achieve "viability," *i.e.*, the ability to
survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States
had a legitimate interest in protecting "potential life,"1 it found that
this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-viability
abortions. . . .

At the time of *Roe*, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages.
In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had
liberalized their laws, but *Roe* abruptly ended that political process.
It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and
it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State. As
Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent, the decision
represented the "exercise of raw judicial power," 410 U.S. 179, 222, 93
S.Ct. 762, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and it sparked a national controversy
that has embittered our political culture for a half century. 2

 

Eventually, in *Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey*, 505
U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the Court revisited
*Roe*, but the Members of the Court split three ways. Two Justices
expressed no desire to change *Roe* in any way.5 Four others wanted to
overrule the decision in its entirety. And the three remaining Justices,
who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position. Their
opinion did not endorse *Roe*'s reasoning, and it even hinted that one
or more of its authors might have "reservations" about whether the
Constitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion concluded
that *stare decisis*, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in
most instances, required adherence to what it called *Roe*'s "central
holding"---that a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life
before "viability"---even if that holding was wrong. Anything less, the
opinion claimed, would undermine respect for this Court and the rule of
law.

. . \[T\]he three Justices who authored the controlling opinion
"call\[ed\] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their
national division" by treating the Court's decision as the final
settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.

As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, *Casey*
did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and
widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted
accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few
restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted
abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States
have expressly asked this Court to overrule *Roe* and *Casey* and allow
the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions.

Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to
uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an
abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy---several weeks before the
point at which a fetus is now regarded as "viable" outside the womb. In
defending this law, the State's primary argument is that we should
reconsider and overrule *Roe* and *Casey* and once again allow each
State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side,
respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to reaffirm *Roe* and
*Casey*, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do
so. Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of
pregnancy, they argue, "would be no different than overruling *Casey*
and *Roe* entirely." Brief for Respondents 43. They contend that "no
half-measures" are available and that we must either reaffirm or
overrule *Roe* and *Casey*. Brief for Respondents 50.

We hold that *Roe* and *Case*y must be overruled. The Constitution makes
no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by
any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders
of *Roe* and *Casey* now chiefly rely---the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some
rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right
must be "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition" and
"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." *Washington v.*
Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997)
(internal quotation marks omitted).

The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the
latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in
American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three
quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy.
The abortion right is also critically different from any other right
that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment's
protection of "liberty." *Roe*'s defenders characterize the abortion
right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving
matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage,
but abortion is fundamentally different, as both *Roe* and *Casey*
acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called "fetal
life" and what the law now before us describes as an "unborn human
being." 3

 

*Stare decisis*, the doctrine on which *Casey*'s controlling opinion was
based, does not compel unending adherence to *Roe*'s abuse of judicial
authority. *Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was
exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And
far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue,
*Roe* and *Casey* have enflamed debate and deepened division.

It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to
the people's elected representatives. "The permissibility of abortion,
and the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important
questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another
and then voting." *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 979, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the
Constitution and the rule of law demand.

The law at issue in this case, Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, see
Miss. Code Ann. § 41--41--191 (2018), contains this central provision:
"Except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal
abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform \...
or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable
gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be
greater than fifteen (15) weeks." § 4(b).

. . . Respondents are an abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health
Organization, and one of its doctors. On the day the Gestational Age Act
was enacted, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court against
various Mississippi officials, alleging that the Act violated this
Court's precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The
District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and
permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that "viability
marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is
constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic
abortions" and that 15 weeks' gestational age is "prior to viability."
*Jackson Women's Health Org. v. Currier*, 349 F.Supp.3d 536, 539--540
(S.D. Miss. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit
affirmed. 945 F.3d 265 (2019).

We granted certiorari, 593 U.S. --------, 141 S.Ct. 2619, 209 L.Ed.2d
748 (2021), to resolve the question whether "all pre-viability
prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional," Pet. for Cert.
i. Petitioners' primary defense of the Mississippi Gestational Age Act
is that *Roe* and *Casey* were wrongly decided and that "the Act is
constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review." Brief for
Petitioners 49. Respondents answer that allowing Mississippi to ban
pre-viability abortions "would be no different than overruling *Casey*
and *Roe* entirely." Brief for Respondents 43. They tell us that "no
half-measures" are available: We must either reaffirm or overrule *Roe*
and *Casey*. Brief for Respondents 50.

II

We begin by considering the critical question whether the Constitution,
properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. . . .

A

1

. . . The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain
an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right
must show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text.

2

The underlying theory on which this argument rests---that the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as
procedural, protection for "liberty"---has long been controversial. But
our decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two
categories of substantive rights. 4

 

The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. .
. . The second category---which is the one in question here---comprises
a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in
the Constitution.

In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the
Court has long asked whether the right is "deeply rooted in \[our\]
history and tradition" and whether it is essential to our Nation's
"scheme of ordered liberty." *Timbsv.Indiana*, 586 U.S. --------,
--------, 139 S.Ct. 682, 686, 203 L.Ed.2d 11 (2019) (internal quotation
marks omitted); *McDonald*, 561 U.S. at 764, 767, 130 S.Ct. 3020
(internal quotation marks omitted); *Glucksberg*, 521 U.S., at 721, 117
S.Ct. 2258 (internal quotation marks omitted).19 And in conducting this
inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of the history of the
right at issue.

. . .

A similar inquiry was undertaken in *McDonald*, which held that the
Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. The lead
opinion surveyed the origins of the Second Amendment, the debates in
Congress about the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state
constitutions in effect when that Amendment was ratified (at least 22 of
the 37 States protected the right to keep and bear arms), federal laws
enacted during the same period, and other relevant historical evidence.
561 U.S. at 767--777, 130 S.Ct. 3020. Only then did the opinion conclude
that "the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the
right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to
our system of ordered liberty." *Id., at 778, 130 S.Ct. 3020*; . . .

. . . Historical inquiries of this nature are essential whenever we are
asked to recognize a new component of the "liberty" protected by the Due
Process Clause because the term "liberty" alone provides little
guidance. "Liberty" is a capacious term. As Lincoln once said: "We all
declare for Liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the
same thing."20 In a well-known essay, Isaiah Berlin reported that
"\[h\]istorians of ideas" had cataloged more than 200 different senses
in which the term had been used.

In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendment's reference to
"liberty," we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse
what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty
that Americans should enjoy.

. . . \[G\]uided by the history and tradition that map the essential
components of our Nation's concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what
the *Fourteenth Amendment* means by the term "liberty." When we engage
in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the
Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion.

B

Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in
American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state
constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years
before *Roe* was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized
such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware. . .
.

\[A\]bortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was
regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all
stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory
restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By
the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of
the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the
remaining States would soon follow.. . .

... 5

 

We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least
after "quickening"---*i.e.*, the first felt movement of the fetus in the
womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.
. . . English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century
corroborate the treatises' statements that abortion was a crime. . . .
In this country, the historical record is similar. . . . Manuals for
justices of the peace printed in the Colonies in the 18th century
typically restated the common-law rule on abortion, and some manuals
repeated Hale's and Blackstone's statements that anyone who prescribed
medication "unlawfully to destroy the child" would be guilty of murder
if the woman died. . . . The few cases available from the early colonial
period corroborate that abortion was a crime. . . .

c

. . .In this country during the 19th century, the vast majority of the
States enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of
pregnancy. See Appendix A, *infra* (listing state statutory provisions
in chronological order). By 1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment
was ratified, three-quarters of the States, 28 out of 37, had enacted
statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before
quickening. See *ibid.* Of the nine States that had not yet criminalized
abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910. See *ibid.*

The trend in the Territories that would become the last 13 States was
similar: All of them criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy
between 1850 (the Kingdom of Hawaii) and 1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix
B, *infra*; see also *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 952, 112 S.Ct. 2791
(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part); Dellapenna 317--319. By the end of the 1950s, according to the
*Roe* Court's own count, statutes in all but four States and the
District of Columbia prohibited abortion "however and whenever
performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother." 410
U.S. at 139, 93 S.Ct. 705.35

This overwhelming consensus endured until the day *Roe* was decided. . .
. The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply
rooted in the Nation's history and traditions. On the contrary, an
unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal
punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until
1973. . . .

C

Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right
itself has deep roots, supporters of *Roe* and *Casey* contend that the
abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. *Roe*
termed this a right to privacy, 410 U.S. at 154, 93 S.Ct. 705, and
*Casey* described it as the freedom to make "intimate and personal
choices" that are "central to personal dignity and autonomy," 505 U.S.
at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. *Casey* elaborated: "At the heart of liberty is
the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the
universe, and of the mystery of human life." *Ibid*.

The Court did not claim that this broadly framed right is absolute, and
no such claim would be plausible. While individuals are certainly free
*tonthink* and *to say* what they wish about "existence," "meaning," the
"universe," and "the mystery of human life," they are not always free
*to act* in accordance with those thoughts. License to act on the basis
of such beliefs may correspond to one of the many understandings of
"liberty," but it is certainly not "ordered liberty."

Ordered liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing
interests. *Roe* and *Casey* each struck a particular balance between
the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what
they termed "potential life." *Roe*, 410 U.S. at 150, 93 S.Ct. 705
(emphasis deleted); *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But the
people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently.
In some States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be
even more extensive than the right that *Roe* and *Casey* recognized.
Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on
their 6

 

belief that abortion destroys an "unborn human being." Miss. Code Ann. §
41--41--191(4)(b). Our Nation's historical understanding of ordered
liberty does not prevent the people's elected representatives from
deciding how abortion should be regulated.

. . . Respondents and the Solicitor General also rely on post-*Casey*
decisions like *Lawrence v. Texas*, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156
L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts),
and *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d
609 (2015) (right to marry a person of the same sex). See Brief for
Respondents 18; Brief for United States 23--24.

These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to
autonomy and to define one's "concept of existence" prove too much.
*Casey*, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Those criteria, at a high
level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug
use, prostitution, and the like. See *Compassion in Dying v.
Washington*, 85 F.3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting
from denial of rehearing en banc). None of these rights has any claim to
being deeply rooted in history. *Id*., at 1440, 1445*.*

What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized
in the cases on which *Roe* and *Casey* rely is something that both
those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions
call "potential life" and what the law at issue in this case regards as
the life of an "unborn human being." . . .

D

. . . The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any
serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States' interest in
protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent
draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in *Griswold*
(contraception), *Eisenstadt* (same), *Lawrence* (sexual conduct with
member of the same sex)*,* and *Obergefell* (same-sex marriage). Perhaps
this is designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil
those other rights, but the dissent's analogy is objectionable for a
more important reason: what it reveals about the dissent's views on the
protection of what *Roe* called "potential life." The exercise of the
rights at issue in *Griswold*, *Eisenstadt*, *Lawrence*, and
*Obergefell* does not destroy a "potential life," but an abortion has
that effect. So if the rights at issue in those cases are fundamentally
the same as the right recognized in *Roe* and *Casey*, the implication
is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the
destruction of a "potential life" as a matter of any significance.

. . . Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal
life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent,
by contrast, would impose on the people a particular theory about when
the rights of personhood begin. According to the dissent, the
Constitution *requires* the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the
most basic human right---to live---at least until an arbitrary point in
a pregnancy has passed. Nothing in the Constitution or in our Nation's
legal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt that " 'theory of life.'
" *Post*, at 2320 -- 2321.

III

We next consider whether the doctrine of *stare decisis* counsels
continued acceptance of *Roe* and *Casey*. *Stare decisis* plays an
important role in our case law, and we have explained that it serves
many valuable ends. It protects the interests of those who have taken
action in reliance on a past decision. . . . We have long recognized,
however, that *stare decisis* is "not an inexorable command," *Pearson
v. Callahan*, 555 U.S. 223, 233, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) .
. . when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution---the "great
charter of our liberties," which was meant "to endure through a long
lapse of 7

 

ages," *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, 1 Wheat. 304, 326, 14 U.S. 304, 4
L.Ed. 97 (1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.)---we place a high
value on having the matter "settled right." In addition, when one of our
constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with
the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An erroneous
constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the Constitution, but
our Constitution is notoriously hard to amend. See Art. V; *Kimble*, 576
U.S. at 456, 135 S.Ct. 2401. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we
must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional
decisions.

*\[analysis of stare decisis omitted here and in dissent\]*

**. . .** Precedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court errs,
and occasionally the Court issues an important decision that is
egregiously wrong. When that happens, *stare decisis* is not a
straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent eventually admits that a decision
*could* "be overruled just because it is terribly wrong," though the
dissent does not explain when that would be so.

VI

We must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion
regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before
us satisfies the appropriate standard. . . . Under our precedents,
rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges.
As we have explained, procuring an abortion is not a fundamental
constitutional right because such a right has no basis in the
Constitution's text or in our Nation's history.

It follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons,
and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts
cannot "substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of
legislative bodies." *Ferguson*, 372 U.S. at 729--730, 83 S.Ct. 1028; .
. . That respect for a legislature's judgment applies even when the laws
at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral
substance. . . .

A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is
entitled to a "strong presumption of validity." *Heller v. Doe*, 509
U.S. 312, 319, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993). It must be
sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could
have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests.

. . . These legitimate interests justify Mississippi's Gestational Age
Act. Except "in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal
abnormality," the statute prohibits abortion "if the probable
gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be
greater than fifteen (15) weeks." Miss. Code Ann. § 41--41--191(4)(b).
The Mississippi Legislature's findings recount the stages of "human
prenatal development" and assert the State's interest in "protecting the
life of the unborn." § 2(b)(i). The legislature also found that
abortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and
evacuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of this
procedure "for nontherapeutic or elective reasons \[to be\] a barbaric
practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the
medical profession." § 2(b)(i)(8); see also *Gonzales*, 550 U.S. at
135--143, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (describing such procedures). These legitimate
interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it
follows that respondents' constitutional challenge must fail.

VII

We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral
question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State
from regulating or prohibiting abortion. *Roe* and *Casey* 8

 

arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return
that authority to the people and their elected representatives.

The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice THOMAS, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly holds that there is
no constitutional right to abortion. . .

I write separately to emphasize a second, more fundamental reason why
there is no abortion guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause.. . .
As I have previously explained, "substantive due process" is an oxymoron
that "lack\[s\] any basis in the Constitution."

The Court today declines to disturb substantive due process
jurisprudence generally or the doctrine's application in other, specific
contexts. Cases like *Griswold v. Connecticut*, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct.
1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (right of married persons to obtain
contraceptives)\*; *Lawrence v. Texas*, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472,
156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual
acts); and *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192
L.Ed.2d 609 (2015) (right to same-sex marriage), are not at issue.. . .
\[I\]n future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's
substantive due process precedents, including *Griswold*, *Lawrence*,
and *Obergefell*.

Justice KAVANAUGH, concurring.

I write separately to explain my additional views about why *Roe* was
wrongly decided, why *Roe* should be overruled at this time, and the
future implications of today's decision.

. . . On the question of abortion, the Constitution is . . . neither
pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral and leaves the
issue for the people and their elected representatives to resolve
through the democratic process in the States or Congress---like the
numerous other difficult questions of American social and economic
policy that the Constitution does not address.

Chief Justice ROBERTS, concurring in the judgment.

We granted certiorari to decide one question: "Whether all pre-viability
prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional." Pet. for Cert.
i. That question is directly implicated here: Mississippi's Gestational
Age Act, Miss. Code Ann. § 41--41--191 (2018), generally prohibits
abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy---several weeks before a
fetus is regarded as "viable" outside the womb. In urging our review,
Mississippi stated that its case was "an ideal vehicle" to "reconsider
the bright-line viability rule," and that a judgment in its favor would
"not require the Court to overturn" *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113, 93
S.Ct. 9

 

705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and *Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.
v. Casey*, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). Pet.
for Cert. 5.

Today, the Court nonetheless rules for Mississippi by doing just that. I
would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the
viability line established by *Roe* and *Casey* should be discarded
under a straightforward *stare decisis* analysis. That line never made
any sense. Our abortion precedents describe the right at issue as a
woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should
therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to
choose, but need not extend any further---certainly not all the way to
viability. Mississippi's law allows a woman three months to obtain an
abortion, well beyond the point at which it is considered "late" to
discover a pregnancy. . .. I see no sound basis for questioning the
adequacy of that opportunity.

. . . None of this, however, requires that we also take the dramatic
step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in
*Roe*. Mississippi itself previously argued as much to this Court in
this litigation.

I therefore concur only in the judgment.

Justice BREYER, Justice SOTOMAYOR, and Justice KAGAN, dissenting.

For half a century, *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35
L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and *Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey*, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), have
protected the liberty and equality of women. *Roe* held, and *Casey*
reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a woman's right to decide
for herself whether to bear a child. *Roe* held, and *Casey* reaffirmed,
that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make
that choice for women. The government could not control a woman's body
or the course of a woman's life: It could not determine what the woman's
future would be. Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting
her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most
personal and most consequential of all life decisions.

*Roe and Casey* well understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the
abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different
views about the "moral\[ity\]" of "terminating a pregnancy, even in its
earliest stage." *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And the Court
recognized that "the State has legitimate interests from the outset of
the pregnancy in protecting" the "life of the fetus that may become a
child." *Id.*, at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. So the Court struck a balance, as
it often does when values and goals compete. It held that the State
could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban
contained exceptions to safeguard a woman's life or health. It held that
even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure
in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was
crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a "substantial
obstacle" on a woman's "right to elect the procedure" as she (not the
government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and
complexities of her own life. *Ibid.*

Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very
moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can
force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal
and familial costs. An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is
permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the
law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life
is rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of restrictions.
The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions after the 15th week of
pregnancy. Under the majority's ruling, though, another State's law
could 10

 

do so after ten weeks, or five or three or one---or, again, from the
moment of fertilization. States have already passed such laws, in
anticipation of today's ruling. More will follow. Some States have
enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including
taking medication in one's own home. They have passed laws without any
exceptions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under
those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist's child or a young girl
her father's---no matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too,
after today's ruling, some States may compel women to carry to term a
fetus with severe physical anomalies---for example, one afflicted with
Tay-Sachs disease, sure to die within a few years of birth. States may
even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for
protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a vast
array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice
on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child.

Enforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also be left
largely to the States' devices. A State can of course impose criminal
penalties on abortion providers, including lengthy prison sentences. But
some States will not stop there. Perhaps, in the wake of today's
decision, a state law will criminalize the woman's conduct too,
incarcerating or fining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion.
And as Texas has recently shown, a State can turn neighbor against
neighbor, enlisting fellow citizens in the effort to root out anyone who
tries to get an abortion, or to assist another in doing so.

The majority tries to hide the geographically expansive effects of its
holding. Today's decision, the majority says, permits "each State" to
address abortion as it pleases. *Ante*, at 2284 -- 2285, 112 S.Ct. 2791.
That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor woman who cannot get the
money to fly to a distant State for a procedure. Above all others, women
lacking financial resources will suffer from today's decision. In any
event, interstate restrictions will also soon be in the offing. After
this decision, some States may block women from traveling out of State
to obtain abortions, or even from receiving abortion medications from
out of State. Some may criminalize efforts, including the provision of
information or funding, to help women gain access to other States'
abortion services. Most threatening of all, no language in today's
decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions
nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without
exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens, "the views of \[an
individual State's\] citizens" will not matter. *Ante, at 2240, 112
S.Ct. 2791*. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to
"New York \[or\] California" but to Toronto. *Ante*, at 2305 -- 2306,
112 S.Ct. 2791 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).

Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today's
decision is certain: the curtailment of women's rights, and of their
status as free and equal citizens. Yesterday, the Constitution
guaranteed that a woman confronted with an unplanned pregnancy could
(within reasonable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a
child, with all the life-transforming consequences that act involves.
And in thus safeguarding each woman's reproductive freedom, the
Constitution also protected "\[t\]he ability of women to participate
equally in \[this Nation's\] economic and social life." *Casey*, 505
U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But no longer. As of today, this Court
holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even
the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely
undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare. Some
women, especially women of means, will find ways around the State's
assertion of power. Others---those without money or childcare or the
ability to take time off from work---will not be so fortunate. Maybe
they will try an unsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm,
or even die. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child, but at
significant personal or familial cost. At the least, they will incur the
cost of losing control of their lives. The Constitution will, today's
majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and
equality for all.

And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.
The right *Roe* and *Casey* recognized does not stand alone. To the
contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms
involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation.
Most obviously, the right to 11

 

terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and
use contraception. See *Griswold v. Connecticut*, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct.
1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); *Eisenstadt v. Baird*, 405 U.S. 438, 92
S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972). In turn, those rights led, more
recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. See *Lawrence v.
Texas*, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003);
*Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609
(2015). They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting
autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions. The
majority (or to be more accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today
that nothing it does "cast\[s\] doubt on precedents that do not concern
abortion." *Ante*, at 2277 -- 2278, 135 S.Ct. 2584; cf. *ante*, at 2301
-- 2302, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (advocating the
overruling of *Griswold*, *Lawrence*, and *Obergefell*). But how could
that be? The lone rationale for what the majority does today is that the
right to elect an abortion is not "deeply rooted in history": Not until
*Roe*, the majority argues, did people think abortion fell within the
Constitution's guarantee of liberty. *Ante*, at 2257 -- 2258, 135 S.Ct.
2584. The same could be said, though, of most of the rights the majority
claims it is not tampering with. The majority could write just as long
an opinion showing, for example, that until the mid-20th century, "there
was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain
\[contraceptives\]." *Ante*, at 2248. So one of two things must be true.
Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if
it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th
century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority's opinion is
hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is
one or the other.

One piece of evidence on that score seems especially salient: The
majority's cavalier approach to overturning this Court's precedents.
*Stare decisis* is the Latin phrase for a foundation stone of the rule
of law: that things decided should stay decided unless there is a very
good reason for change. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and
humility. Those qualities are not evident in today's opinion. . . .

We dissent.

I

We start with *Roe* and *Casey*, and with their deep connections to a
broad swath of this Court's precedents. To hear the majority tell the
tale, *Roe* and *Casey* are aberrations: They came from nowhere, went
nowhere---and so are easy to excise from this Nation's constitutional
law. That is not true. After describing the decisions themselves, we
explain how they are rooted in---and themselves led to---other rights
giving individuals control over their bodies and their most personal and
intimate associations. The majority does not wish to talk about these
matters for obvious reasons; to do so would both ground *Roe* and
*Casey* in this Court's precedents and reveal the broad implications of
today's decision. But the facts will not so handily disappear. *Roe* and
*Casey* were from the beginning, and are even more now, embedded in core
constitutional concepts of individual freedom, and of the equal rights
of citizens to decide on the shape of their lives. Those legal concepts,
one might even say, have gone far toward defining what it means to be an
American. For in this Nation, we do not believe that a government
controlling all private choices is compatible with a free people. So we
do not (as the majority insists today) place everything within "the
reach of majorities and \[government\] officials." *West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette*, 319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628
(1943). We believe in a Constitution that puts some issues off limits to
majority rule. Even in the face of public opposition, we uphold the
right of individuals---yes, including women---to make their own choices
and chart their own futures. Or at least, we did once.

A

Some half-century ago, *Roe* struck down a state law making it a crime
to perform an abortion unless its purpose was to save a woman's life.
The *Roe* Court knew it was treading on difficult and disputed ground.
It understood that different people's "experiences," "values," and
"religious training" and beliefs led to "opposing views" about abortion.
410 U.S. at 116, 93 S.Ct. 705. But by a 7-to-2 vote, the Court held that
12

 

in the earlier stages of pregnancy, that contested and contestable
choice must belong to a woman, in consultation with her family and
doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, "founded in
the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty," protected
individual decisionmaking related to "marriage, procreation,
contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education."
*Id.*, at 152--153, 93 S.Ct. 705 (citations omitted). For the same
reasons, the Court held, the Constitution must protect "a woman's
decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." *Id.*, at 153, 93
S.Ct. 705. The Court recognized the myriad ways bearing a child can
alter the "life and future" of a woman and other members of her family.
*Ibid.* A State could not, "by adopting one theory of life," override
all "rights of the pregnant woman." *Id.*, at 162, 93 S.Ct. 705.

At the same time, though, the Court recognized "valid interest\[s\]" of
the State "in regulating the abortion decision." *Id.*, at 153, 93 S.Ct.
705. The Court noted in particular "important interests" in "protecting
potential life," "maintaining medical standards," and "safeguarding
\[the\] health" of the woman. *Id.*, at 154, 93 S.Ct. 705. No
"absolut\[ist\]" account of the woman's right could wipe away those
significant state claims. *Ibid.*

. . . In the 20 years between *Roe* and *Casey*, the Court expressly
reaffirmed *Roe* on two occasions, and applied it on many more.
Recognizing that "arguments \[against *Roe*\] continue to be made," we
responded that the doctrine of *stare decisis* "demands respect in a
society governed by the rule of law." . . .Then, in *Casey*, the Court
considered the matter anew, and again upheld *Roe*'s core precepts. . .
. Central to \[*Casey*'s\] conclusion was a full-throated restatement of
a woman's right to choose. . . .

. . . In eliminating that right, we need to say before further
describing our precedents, is not taking a "neutral" position, as
Justice KAVANAUGH tries to argue. *Ante*, at 2304 -- 2305, 2306, 2307 --
2308, 2309 -- 2310 (concurring opinion). His idea is that neutrality
lies in giving the abortion issue to the States, where some can go one
way and some another. But would he say that the Court is being
"scrupulously neutral" if it allowed New York and California to ban all
the guns they want? *Ante*, at 2305, 112 S.Ct. 2791. If the Court
allowed some States to use unanimous juries and others not? If the Court
told the States: Decide for yourselves whether to put restrictions on
church attendance? We could go on---and in fact we will. Suppose Justice
KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority opinion) that the
rights we just listed are more textually or historically grounded than
the right to choose. What, then, of the right to contraception or
same-sex marriage? Would it be "scrupulously neutral" for the Court to
eliminate those rights too? The point of all these examples is that when
it comes to rights, the Court does not act "neutrally" when it leaves
everything up to the States. Rather, the Court acts neutrally when it
protects the right against all comers. And to apply that point to the
case here: When the Court decimates a right women have held for 50
years, the Court is not being "scrupulously neutral." It is instead
taking sides: against women who wish to exercise the right, and for
States (like Mississippi) that want to bar them from doing so. Justice
KAVANAUGH cannot obscure that point by appropriating the rhetoric of
even-handedness. His position just is what it is: A brook-no-compromise
refusal to recognize a woman's right to choose, from the first day of a
pregnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be squared
with this Court's longstanding view that women indeed have rights
(whatever the state of the world in 1868) to make the most personal and
consequential decisions about their bodies and their lives.

. . . , *Roe* and *Casey* fit neatly into a long line of decisions
protecting from government intrusion a wealth of private choices about
family matters, child rearing, intimate relationships, and procreation.
See *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 851, 857, 112 S.Ct. 2791; *Roe*, 410 U.S. at
152--153, 93 S.Ct. 705;. . . Those cases safeguard particular choices
about whom to marry; whom to have sex with; what family members to live
with; how to raise children---and crucially, whether and when to have
children. In varied cases, the Court explained that those choices---"the
most intimate and personal" a person can make---reflect fundamental
aspects of personal identity; they define the very "attributes of
personhood." *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And they
inevitably shape the nature and future course of a person's life (and
often the lives of those 13

 

closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices belong to the
individual, and not the government. That is the essence of what liberty
requires.

And liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly said, even when
those living in 1868 would not have recognized the claim---because they
would not have seen the person making it as a full-fledged member of the
community. Throughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has
expanded, bringing in individuals formerly excluded. In that way, the
constitutional values of liberty and equality go hand in hand; they do
not inhabit the hermetically sealed containers the majority portrays.
Compare *Obergefell*, 576 U.S. at 672--675, 135 S.Ct. 2584, with *ante*,
at 2245 -- 2246, 135 S.Ct. 2584. So before *Roe* and *Casey*, the Court
expanded in successive cases those who could claim the right to
marry---though their relationships would have been outside the law's
protection in the mid-19th century. See, *e.g.*, *Loving*, 388 U.S. 1,
87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (interracial couples); *Turner v.
Safley*, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (prisoners);
see also, *e.g.*, *Stanley v. Illinois*, 405 U.S. 645, 651--652, 92
S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (offering constitutional protection to
untraditional "family unit\[s\]"). And after *Roe* and *Casey*, of
course, the Court continued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold
that the Fourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, the Court
resolved that the Amendment also conferred on same-sex couples the right
to marry. See *Lawrence*, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508;
*Obergefell*, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609. In
considering that question, the Court held, "\[h\]istory and tradition,"
especially as reflected in the course of our precedent, "guide and
discipline \[the\] inquiry." *Id.*, at 664, 135 S.Ct. 2584. But the
sentiments of 1868 alone do not and cannot "rule the present." *Ibid.*

. . .\[T\]he majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says)
neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice
without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you
that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.) Today's decision, the
majority first says, "does not undermine" the decisions cited by *Roe*
and *Casey---*the ones involving "marriage, procreation, contraception,
\[and\] family relationships"---"in any way.". Note that this first
assurance does not extend to rights recognized after *Roe* and *Casey*,
and partly based on them---in particular, rights to same-sex intimacy
and marriage. See *supra*, at 2329 -- 2330.6 On its later tries, though,
the majority includes those too: "Nothing in this opinion should be
understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion."
*Ante*, at 2277 -- 2278, 112 S.Ct. 2791; see *ante*, at 2280 -- 2281,
112 S.Ct. 2791. That right is unique, the majority asserts, "because
\[abortion\] terminates life or potential life." *Ante, at 2277, 112
S.Ct. 2791* (internal quotation marks omitted); see *ante*, at 2257 --
2258, 2280 -- 2281. So the majority depicts today's decision as "a
restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only." *Smith v.
Allwright*, 321 U.S. 649, 669, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944)
(Roberts, J., dissenting). Should the audience for these
too-much-repeated protestations be duly satisfied? We think not.

The first problem with the majority's account comes from Justice
THOMAS's concurrence---which makes clear he is not with the program. In
saying that nothing in today's opinion casts doubt on non-abortion
precedents, Justice THOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at
issue in this very case. See *ante*, at 2303 -- 2304 ("\[T\]his case
does not present the opportunity to reject" those precedents). But he
lets us know what he wants to do when they are. "\[I\]n future cases,"
he says, "we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due
process precedents, including *Griswold*, *Lawrence*, and *Obergefell*."
*Ante*, at 2301; see also *supra*, at 2253 -- 2254, and n. 6. And when
we reconsider them? Then "we have a duty" to "overrul\[e\] these
demonstrably erroneous decisions." *Ante*, at 2301. So at least one
Justice is planning to use the ticket of today's decision again and
again and again.

Even placing the concurrence to the side, the assurance in today's
opinion still does not work. Or at least that is so if the majority is
serious about its sole reason for overturning *Roe* and *Casey*: the
legal status of abortion in the 19th century. Except in the places
quoted above, the state interest in protecting fetal life plays no part
in the majority's analysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in
not expressing a view 14

 

"about the status of the fetus." *Ante*, at 2277; see *ante*, at 2257 --
2258 (aligning itself with *Roe*'s and *Casey*'s stance of not deciding
whether life or potential life is involved); *ante*, at 2261 -- 2262
(similar). The majority's departure from *Roe* and *Casey* rests
instead---and only---on whether a woman's decision to end a pregnancy
involves any Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which *Roe*
and *Casey* balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life).7
According to the majority, no liberty interest is present---because (and
only because) the law offered no protection to the woman's choice in the
19th century. But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would
not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the
rights recognized in *Lawrence* and *Obergefell* to same-sex intimacy
and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in *Loving* to
marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in
*Griswold* to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the
right recognized in *Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson*, 316 U.S.
535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), not to be sterilized without
consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those
decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the
States too---whatever the particular state interests involved. And if
that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and
principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not
threaten---does not even "undermine"---any number of other
constitutional rights. *Ante*, at 2257 -- 2258.8

Nor does it even help just to take the majority at its word. Assume the
majority is sincere in saying, for whatever reason, that it will go so
far and no further. Scout's honor. Still, the future significance of
today's opinion will be decided in the future. And law often has a way
of evolving without regard to original intentions---a way of actually
following where logic leads, rather than tolerating hard-to-explain
lines. Rights can expand in that way. Dissenting in *Lawrence*, Justice
Scalia explained why he took no comfort in the Court's statement that a
decision recognizing the right to same-sex intimacy did "not involve"
same-sex marriage. 539 U.S. at 604, 123 S.Ct. 2472. That could be true,
he wrote, "only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic
have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court." *Id.*, at 605, 123
S.Ct. 2472. Score one for the dissent, as a matter of prophecy. And
logic and principle are not one-way ratchets. Rights can contract in the
same way and for the same reason---because whatever today's majority
might say, one thing really does lead to another. We fervently hope that
does not happen because of today's decision. We hope that we will not
join Justice Scalia in the book of prophets. But we cannot understand
how anyone can be confident that today's opinion will be the last of its
kind.

. . . Anyway, today's decision, taken on its own, is catastrophic
enough. As a matter of constitutional method, the majority's commitment
to replicate in 2022 every view about the meaning of liberty held in
1868 has precious little to recommend it. . . .

As a matter of constitutional substance, the majority's opinion has all
the flaws its method would suggest. Because laws in 1868 deprived women
of any control over their bodies, the majority approves States doing so
today. Because those laws prevented women from charting the course of
their own lives, the majority says States can do the same again. Because
in 1868, the government could tell a pregnant woman---even in the first
days of her pregnancy---that she could do nothing but bear a child, it
can once more impose that command. Today's decision strips women of
agency over what even the majority agrees is a contested and contestable
moral issue. It forces her to carry out the State's will, whatever the
circumstances and whatever the harm it will wreak on her and her family.
In the Fourteenth Amendment's terms, it takes away her liberty. Even
before we get to *stare decisis*, we dissent.

II

By overruling *Roe*, *Casey*, and more than 20 cases reaffirming or
applying the constitutional right to abortion, the majority abandons
*stare decisis*, a principle central to the rule of law*.* . . . 15

 

III

"Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Court's decisionmaking."
*Payne*, 501 U.S. at 844, 111 S.Ct. 2597 (Marshall, J., dissenting).
*Roe* has stood for fifty years. *Casey*, a precedent about precedent
specifically confirming *Roe*, has stood for thirty. And the doctrine of
*stare decisis*---a critical element of the rule of law---stands
foursquare behind their continued existence. The right those decisions
established and preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both
originating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily integrity,
personal autonomy, and family relationships. The abortion right is also
embedded in the lives of women---shaping their expectations, influencing
their choices about relationships and work, supporting (as all
reproductive rights do) their social and economic equality. Since the
right's recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed to support
what the majority does today. Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have
provided any new reasons to reach a different result than *Roe* and
*Casey* did. All that has changed is this Court.

Mississippi---and other States too---knew exactly what they were doing
in ginning up new legal challenges to *Roe* and *Casey*. The 15-week ban
at issue here was enacted in 2018. Other States quickly followed:
Between 2019 and 2021, eight States banned abortion procedures after six
to eight weeks of pregnancy, and three States enacted all-out bans.29
Mississippi itself decided in 2019 that it had not gone far enough: The
year after enacting the law under review, the State passed a 6-week
restriction. A state senator who championed both Mississippi laws said
the obvious out loud. "\[A\] lot of people thought," he explained, that
"finally, we have" a conservative Court "and so now would be a good time
to start testing the limits of *Roe*."30 In its petition for certiorari,
the State had exercised a smidgen of restraint. It had urged the Court
merely to roll back *Roe* and *Casey*, specifically assuring the Court
that "the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court
to overturn" those precedents. Pet. for Cert. 5; see *ante*, at 2313,
111 S.Ct. 2597 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). But as
Mississippi grew ever more confident in its prospects, it resolved to go
all in. It urged the Court to overrule *Roe* and *Casey*. Nothing but
everything would be enough.

Earlier this Term, this Court signaled that Mississippi's stratagem
would succeed. Texas was one of the fistful of States to have recently
banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It added to that
"flagrantly unconstitutional" restriction an unprecedented scheme to
"evade judicial scrutiny." *Whole Woman's Healthv.Jackson*, 594 U.S.
--------, --------, 141 S.Ct. 2494, 2498, 210 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2021)
(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). And five Justices acceded to that cynical
maneuver. They let Texas defy this Court's constitutional rulings,
nullifying *Roe* and *Casey* ahead of schedule in the Nation's second
largest State.

And now the other shoe drops, courtesy of that same five-person
majority. . . .Now a new and bare majority of this Court---acting at
practically the first moment possible---overrules *Roe* and *Casey*. It
converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward
*Roe* and *Casey* into a decision greenlighting even total abortion
bans. It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards
women's freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law
principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of
that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex
intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court's
legitimacy.

. . . With sorrow---for this Court, but more, for the many millions of
American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional
protection---we dissent.

[^1]: **^2^** Justice Breyer argues that including Ewing's grand theft
    as a triggering offense cannot be justified on
    *"property-crime-related incapacitation grounds"* because such
    crimes do not count as prior strikes. *Post,* at 51. But the State's
    interest in dealing with repeat felons like Ewing is not so limited.
    As we have explained, the overarching objective of the three strikes
    law is to prevent serious or violent offenders like Ewing from
    repeating their criminal behavior. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 667(b)
    (West 1999) ("It is the intent of the Legislature \... to ensure
    longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit
    a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or
    violent felony offenses"). The California Legislature therefore made
    a "deliberate policy decision \... that the gravity of the new
    felony should not be a determinative factor in 'triggering' the
    application of the Three Strikes Law." Ardaiz 9. Neither the Eighth
    Amendment nor this Court's precedent forecloses that legislative
    choice.

[^2]: **^1^** Yates was also charged with making a false statement to
    federal law enforcement officers, in violation of18 U.S.C. §
    1001(a)(2). That charge, on which Yates was acquitted, is not
    relevant to our analysis.

[^3]: **^2^** The dissent assiduously ignores all this,*post,*at 1096,
    in insisting that Congress wrote § 1519to cover, along with shredded
    corporate documents, red grouper slightly smaller than the legal
    limit.

[^4]: **^3^** For the same reason, we do not think the meaning of
    \"tangible objects\" (or \"tangible things,\" see Fed. Rule Civ.
    Proc. 26(b)) in other discovery prescriptions cited by the
    Government leads to the conclusion that \"tangible object\" in §
    1519encompasses any and all physical evidence existing on land or in
    the sea.

[^5]: **^4^** The dissent contends that nothing can be drawn from the
    placement of § 1519because, before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, \"all
    of Chapter 73 was ordered chronologically.\"*Post,*at 1095. The
    argument might have some force if the factual premise were correct.
    In Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress directed insertion of § 1514A *before*§
    1518, then the last section in Chapter 73. If, as the dissent
    argues, Congress adopted § 1519to fill out § 1512, *post,*at 6-7, it
    would have made more sense for Congress to codify the substance of §
    1519within § 1512 or in a new § 1512A, rather than placing §
    1519among specialized provisions. Notably, in Sarbanes-Oxley,
    Congress added § 1512(c)(1), \"a broad ban on evidence-spoliation,\"
    cf. *post,*at 1095, n. 2, to § 1512, even though § 1512\'s
    preexisting title and provisions all related to witness-tampering.

[^6]: **^5^** Despite this sweeping \"in relation to\" language, the
    dissent remarkably suggests that § 1519does not \"ordinarily operate
    in th\[e\] context \[of\] federal court\[s\],\" for those courts are
    not \"department\[s\] or agenc\[ies\].\"*Post,*at 1095. That
    suggestion, which, as one would expect, lacks the Government\'s
    endorsement, does not withstand examination. The Senate Committee
    Report on § 1519, on which the dissent elsewhere relies, see
    *post,*at 1093, explained that an obstructive act is within §
    1519\'s scope if \"done \'in contemplation\' of or in relation to a
    matter or investigation.\" S. Rep. 107-146, at 15. The Report
    further informed that § 1519\"is \... meant to do away with the
    distinctions, which some courts have read into obstruction statutes,
    between court proceedings, investigations, regulatory or
    administrative proceedings (whether formal or not), and less formal
    government inquiries, regardless of their title.\"*Ibid.*If any
    doubt remained about the multiplicity of contexts in which § 1519was
    designed to apply, the Report added, \"\[t\]he intent of the
    provision is simple; people should not be destroying, altering, or
    falsifying documents to obstruct any government function.\" *Ibid.*

[^7]: **^6^** Furthermore, if \"tangible object\" in § 1519is read to
    include any physical object, § 1519would prohibit all of the conduct
    proscribed by § 2232(a), which imposes a maximum penalty of five
    years in prison for destroying or removing \"property\" to prevent
    its seizure by the Government. See*supra,*at 1078 - 1079.

[^8]: **^7^** The dissent contends that \"record, document, or tangible
    object\" in § 1519should be construed in conformity with \"record,
    document, or other object\" in § 1512(c)(1)because both provisions
    address \"the same basic problem.\"*Post,*at 1096 - 1097. But why
    should that be so when Congress prohibited in § 1519additional
    actions, specific to paper and electronic documents and records,
    actions it did not prohibit in § 1512(c)(1)? When Congress passed
    Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, courts had already interpreted the phrase
    \"alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an object\" in §
    1512(b)(2)(B)to apply to all types of physical evidence. See,
    *e.g.,United States v. Applewhaite,*195 F.3d 679, 688 (C.A.3
    1999)(affirming conviction under § 1512(b)(2)(B)for persuading
    another person to paint over blood spatter). Congress\' use of a
    formulation in § 1519that did not track the one used in §
    1512(b)(2)(B)(and repeated in § 1512(c)(1)) suggests that Congress
    designed § 1519to be interpreted apart from § 1512, not in lockstep
    with it.

[^9]: **^8^** The dissent cites*United States v. McRae,*702 F.3d 806,
    834-838 (C.A.5 2012), *United States v. Maury,*695 F.3d 227, 243-244
    (C.A.3 2012), and *United States v. Natal,*2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
    108852, \*24-\*26 (Conn., Aug. 7, 2014), as cases that would not be
    covered by § 1519as we read it. *Post,*at 1100 - 1101. Those cases
    supply no cause for concern that persons who commit \"major\"
    obstructive acts, *id.* at 1100, will go unpunished. The defendant
    in *McRae,*a police officer who seized a car containing a corpse and
    then set it on fire, was also convicted for that conduct under 18
    U.S.C. § 844(h)and sentenced to a term of 120 months\' imprisonment
    for that offense. See 702 F.3d, at 817-818, 839-840. The defendant
    in *Natal,*who repainted a van to cover up evidence of a fatal
    arson, was also convicted of three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. §
    3and sentenced to concurrent terms of 174 months\' imprisonment. See
    Judgment in *United States v. Morales,*No. 3:12-cr-164 (Conn., Jan.
    12, 2015). And the defendant in *Maury,*a company convicted under §
    1519of concealing evidence that a cement mixer\'s safety lock was
    disabled when a worker\'s fingers were amputated, was also convicted
    of numerous other violations, including three counts of violating 18
    U.S.C. § 1505for concealing evidence of other worker safety
    violations. See 695 F.3d, at 244-245. See also *United States v.
    Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co.,*2007 WL 2282514, at \*70
    (D.N.J., Aug. 2, 2007)(setting forth charges against the company).
    For those violations, the company was fined millions of dollars and
    ordered to operate under the supervision of a court-appointed
    monitor. See 695 F.3d, at 246.\* \* \*

[^10]: **^1^** From Alabama and Alaska through Wisconsin and Wyoming
    (and trust me-in all that come between), States similarly use the
    terms \"tangible objects\" and \"tangible things\" in statutes and
    rules of all sorts. See,*e.g.,*Ala.Code § 34-17-1(3) (2010)(defining
    \"landscape architecture\" to include the design of certain
    \"tangible objects and features\"); Alaska Rule Civ. Proc. 34(a)(1)
    (2014) (allowing litigants to \"inspect, copy, test, or sample any
    tangible things\" that constitute or contain discoverable material);
    Wis. Stat. § 804.09(1)(2014) (requiring the production of
    \"designated tangible things\" in civil proceedings); Wyo. Rule
    Crim. Proc. 41(h)(2014) (defining \"property\" for purposes of a
    search-and-seizure statute to include \"documents, books, papers and
    any other tangible objects\").

[^11]: **^2^** The lonesome exception to Chapter 73\'s chronological
    order is § 1514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to create a civil action
    to protect whistleblowers. Congress decided to place that provision
    right after the only other section in Chapter 73 to authorize a
    civil action (that one to protect victims and witnesses). The
    plurality, seizing on the § 1514 example, says it likewise \"would
    have made more sense for Congress to codify the substance of §
    1519within § 1512or in a new § 1512A.\"*Ante,*at 1084, n. 4. But §
    1512is titled \"Tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant,\"
    and its provisions almost all protect witnesses from intimidation
    and harassment. It makes perfect sense that Congress wanted a broad
    ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its own rather than as part
    of-or an appendage to-a witness-tampering provision.

[^12]: **^3^** The plurality\'s objection to this statement is difficult
    to understand. It cannot take issue with*Hubbard*\'s holding that
    \"a federal court is neither a \'department\' nor an \'agency\' \"
    in a statute referring, just as § 1519does, to \"any matter within
    the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\"
    514 U.S., at 698, 715, 115 S.Ct. 1754. So the plurality suggests
    that the phrase \"in relation to \... any such matter\" in §
    1519somehow changes *Hubbard*\'s result. See *ante,*at 1084 - 1085,
    and n. 5. But that phrase still demands that evidence-tampering
    relate to a \"matter within the jurisdiction of any department or
    agency\"-excluding courts, as *Hubbard*commands. That is why the
    federal government, as far as I can tell, has never once brought a
    prosecution under § 1519for evidence-tampering in litigation between
    private parties. It instead uses § 1512(c)(1)for that purpose.

[^13]: **^4^** Section 1512(c)(1)also applies more broadly than § 1519in
    proceedings relating to insurance regulation. The term \"official
    proceeding\" in § 1512(c)(1)is defined to include \"proceeding\[s\]
    involving the business of insurance whose activities affect
    interstate commerce before any insurance regulatory official or
    agency.\" § 1515(a)(1)(D). But § 1519wouldn\'t usually apply in that
    context because state, not federal, agencies handle most insurance
    regulation.

[^14]: **^5^** The plurality seeks support for this argument in the
    Sentencing Commission\'s construction of the phrase \"records,
    documents, or tangible objects,\"*ante,*at 1086, but to no avail.
    The plurality cites a note in the Commission\'s Manual clarifying
    that this phrase, as used in the Sentencing Guidelines, \"includes\"
    various electronic information, communications, and storage devices.
    United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2J1.2,
    comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014) (USSG). But \"includes\" (following its
    ordinary definition) \"is not exhaustive,\" as the Commission\'s
    commentary makes explicit. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, comment., n. 2.
    Otherwise, the Commission\'s construction wouldn\'t encompass
    *paper*documents. All the note does is to make plain that \"records,
    documents, or tangible objects\" embraces stuff relating to the
    digital (as well as the material) world.

[^15]: **^6^** As part of its lenity argument, the plurality asserts
    that Yates did not have \"fair warning\" that his conduct amounted
    to a felony.*Ante,*at 1088; see *ante,*at 1087 (stating that \"Yates
    would have had scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution\"
    when throwing fish overboard). But even under the plurality\'s view,
    the dumping of fish is potentially a federal felony-just under §
    1512(c)(1), rather than § 1519. See *ante,*at 1084 - 1085. In any
    event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordinary meaning
    of § 1519covers Yates\'s conduct, see *ante,*at 1081: That
    provision, no less than § 1512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in
    the clearest possible terms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks
    notice of a statute\'s scope, he is more likely to focus on the
    plain text than (as the plurality would have it) on the section
    number, the superfluity principle, and the *noscitur* and
    *ejusdem*canons.

[^16]: **^7^** The concurrence contends that when the*noscitur* and
    *ejusdem*canons are in play, \" \'known unknowns\' should be similar
    to known knowns, *i.e.,*here, records and documents.\" *Ante,*at
    1089. But as noted above, records and documents *are*similar to
    crocodiles and fish as far as § 1519is concerned: All are
    potentially useful as evidence in an investigation. See *supra,*at
    1097. The concurrence never explains why *that*similarity isn\'t the
    relevant one in a statute aimed at evidence-tampering.

     

     

     

[^17]: **^\*^** The defendant was convicted at trial. The Appellate
    Division reversed the defendant's conviction and granted a new trial
    upon the ground that the \"transactions between the defendant and
    Dr. Wechter were between physician and patient for the purpose of
    treatment and that treatment was accomplished,\" and that evidence
    thereof should not have been admitted. From its determination both
    parties appealed.

[^18]: **^\*\*^** The Appellate Division reversed the defendant's

    \"transactions between the defendant and Dr. Wechter were between
    physician and patient for the purpose of treatment and that
    treatment was accomplished,\" and that evidence thereof should not
    have been admitted.

[^19]: **^15^** The Court's and Justice Ginsburg's reliance
    upon*Liparota* v. *United States,* 471 U. S. 419 (1985), is
    misplaced. *Ante,* at 610-612; *ante,* at 621-622. Although the
    Court is usually concerned with fine nuances of statutory text, its
    discussion of *Liparota* simply ignores the fact that the food stamp
    fraud provision, unlike § 5861(d), contained the word "knowingly."
    The Members of the Court in *Liparota* disagreed on the proper
    interpretation. The dissenters accepted the Government's view that
    the term merely required proof that the defendant had knowledge of
    the facts that constituted the crime. See *Liparota,* 471 U. S., at
    442-443 (White, J., dissenting) ("I would read § 2024(b)(1)\... to
    require awareness of only the relevant aspects of one's conduct
    rendering it illegal, not the fact of illegality"). The majority,
    however, concluded that "knowingly" also connoted knowledge of
    illegality. *Id.,* at 424-425. Because neither "knowingly" nor any
    comparable term appears in § 5861(d), the statute before us today
    requires even less proof of knowledge than the dissenters would have
    demanded in *Liparota.*
