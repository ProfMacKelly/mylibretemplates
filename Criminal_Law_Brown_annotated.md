Export Customization Tips

We designed this opencasebook.org export using MS Word Styles to
simplify customization. The \"Styles Pane\" in Word\'s \"Home\" tab
shows a list of styles in the document, and the active style of your
current element or selection.

For example, you can quickly change the case text font for the whole
document by modifying the \"Case Body\" style. The style modification
screen also shows which style your style is \"Based On.\" If you modify
the style listed there, all styles based on it will also change. Some
older documents might use different styles than newer ones--- click into
an element and check the Styles Pane to confirm its style.

Check out Microsoft\'s [extensive styles
documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-styles-advantage-in-word-b4a6372f-188c-93cb-831b-c4dd0cb3a881)
for the finer points and caveats.

**Remember:** style modifications can yield sweeping results that
aren\'t always apparent on the page you\'re viewing. Make a backup copy
of your document before experimenting.

Nature and Functions of Criminal Law

 

Why, when, and who to punish?

 

The materials in this chapter provide a quick, basic introduction to the
purposes and principles that motivate and justify criminal liabililty
and punishment, as well as some brief information on the actual
operation of U.S. criminal justice administration. *Kupa* provides an
example of a court engaging the purposes of criminal punishment in
assessing whether a particular sentence is excessive, and it illustrates
one mechanism\--mandatory minimum sentences\--that determine punishments
in some cases. As you read these materials, consider: when and why do we
use criminal punishment? Who determines when and why we punish? What are
the justifications, costs, and consequences of criminal prosecution and
punishment? *Dudley and Stephens* is a classic case\--which has long had
a place at the start of many US and British criminal law
casebooks\--that raises questions about the purpose of criminal
punishment, the role of discretion in criminal law enforcement, and the
sources of criminal law.

 

 

 

 

Criminal Justice System Flowchart

 

<https://www.bjs.gov/content/downloadchart.cfm>

 

As a basic reference for the typical procedural stages in the criminal
justice system, see this standard
[flowchart](https://www.bjs.gov/content/downloadchart.cfm) from the U.S.
Bureau of Justice Statistics. No need to study it in depth now; you can
turn to it as a reference throughout the course for some clarity on
procedural stages and events that you encounter in the cases and course
materials.

Basic Crime and Incarceration Data

 

By various measures, crime rates (including homicides) have sharply
declined in the last 30 years. For example:

![Violent victimization data

height="2.6483333333333334in"}

 

Over the same period, incarceration rates have dramatically increased,
so that the U.S. for nearly two decades has imprisoned larger share of
its citizens than any other country:

What is distinctive about Criminal Law?

 

Henry M. Hart, [*The Aims of the Criminal
Law*](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol23/iss3/2/), Law &
Contemp. Probs. 401, 402-06 (1958):

... We can get our broadest view of the aims of the criminal law if we
look at them from the point of view of the makers of a constitution---of
those who are seeking to establish sound foundations for a tolerable and
durable social order. From this point of view, these aims can be most
readily seen, as they need to be seen, in their relation to the aims of
the good society generally. In this setting, the basic question emerges:
Why should the good society make use of the method of the criminal law
at all?

The question posed raises preliminarily an even more fundamental
inquiry: What do we mean by \"crime\" and \"criminal\"? Or, put more
accurately, what should we understand to be \"the method of the criminal
law,\" the use of which is in question? This latter way of formulating
the preliminary inquiry is more accurate, because it pictures the
criminal law as a process, a way of doing something, which is what it
is. A great deal of intellectual energy has been misspent in an effort
to develop a concept of crime as \"a natural and social phenomenon\"
abstracted from the functioning system of institutions which make use of
the concept and give it impact and meaning. But the criminal law, like
all law, is concerned with the pursuit of human purposes through the
forms and modes of social organization, and it needs always to be
thought about in that context as a method or process of doing something.

What then are the characteristics of this method?

1.  The method operates by means of a series of directions, or commands,
    formulated in general terms, telling people what they must or must
    not do. Mostly, the commands of the criminal law are \"must-nots,\"
    or prohibitions, which can be satisfied by inaction. \"Do not
    murder, rape, or rob.\" But some of them are \"musts,\" or
    affirmative requirements, which can be satisfied only by taking a
    specifically, or relatively specifically, described kind of action.
    \"Support your wife and children,\" and \"File your income tax
    return.\"\'

2.  The commands are taken as valid and binding upon all those who fall
    within their terms when the time comes for complying with them,
    whether or not they have been formulated in advance in a single
    authoritative set of words They speak to members of the community,
    in other words, in the community\'s behalf, with all the power and
    prestige of the community behind them.

3.  The commands are subject to one or more sanctions for disobedience
    which the community is prepared to enforce.

Thus far, it will be noticed, nothing has been said about the criminal
law which is not true also of a large part of the noncriminal, or civil,
law. The law of torts, the law of contracts, and almost every other
branch of private law that can be mentioned operate, too, with general
directions prohibiting or requiring described types of conduct, and the
community\'s tribunals enforce these commands. What, then, is
distinctive about the method of the criminal law?

Can crimes be distinguished from civil wrongs on the ground that they
constitute injuries to society generally which society is interested in
preventing? The difficulty is that society is interested also in the due
fulfillment of contracts and the avoidance of traffic accidents and most
of the other stuff of civil litigation. The civil law is framed and
interpreted and enforced with a constant eye to these social interests.
Does the distinction lie in the fact that proceedings to enforce the
criminal law are instituted by public officials rather than private
complainants? The difficulty is that public officers may also bring many
kinds of \"civil\" enforcement actions---for an injunction, for the
recovery of a \"civil\" penalty, or even for the detention of the
defendant by public authority. Is the distinction, then, in the peculiar
character of what is done to people who are adjudged to be criminals?
The difficulty is that, with the possible exception of death, exactly
the same kinds of unpleasant consequences, objectively considered, can
be and are visited upon unsuccessful defendants in civil proceedings.

If one were to judge from the notions apparently underlying many
judicial opinions, and the overt language even of some of them, the
solution of the puzzle is simply that a crime is anything which is
*called* a crime, and a criminal penalty is simply the penalty provided
for doing anything which has been given that name. So vacant a concept
is a betrayal of intellectual bankruptcy.... Moreover, it is false to
popular understanding... \[C\]onstitutions proclaim that a conviction
for crime is a distinctive and serious matter---something, and not a
nothing. What is that something?

4.  What distinguishes a criminal from a civil sanction and all that
    distinguishes it, it is ventured, is the judgment of community
    condemnation which accompanies and justifies its imposition. As
    Professor Gardner wrote not long ago, in a distinct but cognate
    connection:

The essence of punishment for moral delinquency lies in the criminal
conviction itself. One may lose more money on the stock market than in a
court-room; a prisoner of war camp may well provide a harsher
environment than a state prison; death on the field of battle has the
same physical characteristics as death by sentence of law. It is the
expression of the community\'s hatred, fear, or contempt for the convict
which alone characterizes physical hardship as punishment.

If this is what a \"criminal\" penalty is, then we can say readily
enough what a \"crime\" is. It is not simply anything which a
legislature chooses to call a \"crime.\" It is not simply antisocial
conduct which public officers are given a responsibility to suppress. It
is not simply any conduct to which a legislature chooses to attach a
\"criminal\" penalty. It is conduct which, if duly shown to have taken
place, will incur a formal and solemn pronouncement of the moral
condemnation of the community.

5.  The method of the criminal law, of course, involves something more
    than the threat (and, on due occasion, the expression) of community
    condemnation of antisocial conduct. It involves, in addition, the
    threat (and, on due occasion, the imposition) of unpleasant physical
    consequences, commonly called punishment. But if Professor Gardner
    is right, these added consequences take their character as
    punishment from the condemnation which precedes them and serves as
    the warrant for their infliction. Indeed, the condemnation plus the
    added consequences may well be considered, compendiously, as
    constituting the punishment. Otherwise, it would be necessary to
    think of a convicted criminal as going unpunished if the imposition
    or execution of his sentence is suspended.

In traditional thought and speech, the ideas of crime and punishment
have been inseparable; the consequences of conviction for crime have
been described as a matter of course as \"punishment.\" The Constitution
of the United States and its amendments, for example, use this word or
its verb form in relation to criminal offenses no less than six
times....

At least under existing law, there is a vital difference between the
situation of a patient who has been committed to a mental hospital and
the situation of an inmate of a state penitentiary. The core of the
difference is precisely that the patient has not incurred the moral
condemnation of his community, whereas the convict has. 

 

 

 

The nature of prosecutorial discretion

 

All criminal charges are filed at the discretion of a public prosecutor
(except in a few states, where private citizens can file misdemeanor
criminal complaints, which public prosecutors often have a right to take
over). Prosecutors have no legal obligation to file criminal charges
even when they have evidence sufficient to prove guilt, and in fact
prosecutors routinely decline to prosecute charges even when they have
the evidence to do so. See Daniel Richman, *Actual Knowledge, Willful
Blindness, and the Jan. 6 Hearings*,
[LawFare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/actual-knowledge-willful-blindness-and-jan-6-hearings)
blog, June 21, 2022:

Make no mistake, no responsible Justice Department prosecutor would
restrict her analysis to the law and the facts when deciding whether to
bring any criminal case, let alone one against a former president.
Considerations of the public interest will regularly counsel against a
prosecution, even when the elements of an offense can be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.

Prosecutors decline to prosecute some cases for a wide variety of
reasons, and courts as well as scholars routinely affirm that that
discretion not to charge offenses is essential to ensure justice.
Legally, prosecutors may decline to prosecute for any reason except one
prohibited by law, such as electing to charge based on the suspect's
race, ethnicity, religion, or political views and activities.
Prosecutors generally have no obligation to explain their charging or
non-charging decisions to the public or a court; alleged victims have no
standing to challenge prosecutor's declination (or guilty plea
agreement) decisions; and judges have virtually no authority to review
or reverse prosecutors' discretionary charging decisions. See
Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978):

In our system, so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe
that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision
whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a
grand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion. Within the
limits set by the legislature\'s constitutionally valid definition of
chargeable offenses, \"the conscious exercise of some selectivity in
enforcement is not, in itself, a federal constitutional violation\" so
long as \"the selection was \[not\] deliberately based upon an
unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary
classification.\" Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 368 U. S. 456.

See also United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733, 741 (D.C.
Cir. 2016):

The \[federal\] Executive\'s primacy in criminal charging decisions is
long settled. That authority stems from the Constitution\'s delegation
of \"take Care\" duties, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, and the pardon power,
id. § 2, to the Executive Branch. See United States v. Armstrong, 517
U.S. 456, 464 (1996 .... Decisions to initiate charges, or to dismiss
charges once brought, \"lie\[\] at the core of the Executive\'s duty to
see to the faithful execution of the laws.\" Cmty. for Creative
Non-Violence v. Pierce, 786 F.2d 1199, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The
Supreme Court thus has repeatedly emphasized that \"\[w\]hether to
prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury are
decisions that generally rest in the prosecutor\'s discretion.\" United
States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124 (1979) ....

Correspondingly, \"judicial authority is . . . at its most limited\"
when reviewing the Executive\'s exercise of discretion over charging
determinations. *Pierce*, 786 F.2d. at 1201 .... The decision whether to
prosecute turns on factors such as \"the strength of the case, the
prosecution\'s general deterrence value, the \[g\]overnment\'s
enforcement priorities, and the case\'s relationship to the
\[g\]overnment\'s overall enforcement plan.\" Wayte v. United States,
470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985).

See also Stephanos Bibas, *The Need for Prosecutorial Discretion*, 19
TEMP. POL. & CIV. RTS. L. REV. 369, 370 (2010) ("Even in a world of
unlimited resources and sane criminal codes, discretion would be
essential to doing justice. Justice requires not only rules but also
fine-grained moral evaluations and distinctions."); Josh Bowers, *Legal
Guilt, Normative Innocence, and the Equitable Decision Not to
Prosecute*, 110 COLUM. L. REV. 1655, 1662--63 (2010) (the notion that
prosecutors should rigidly apply the criminal law is "both untenable and
unattractive" and almost universally rejected in "case law and
commentary"); Zachary S. Price, *Enforcement Discretion and Executive
Duty*, 67 VAND. L. REV. 671, 745 (2014) ("the breadth and depth of
substantive \[criminal\] law . . . presumes a regime in which executive
officials exercise discretion to moderate the rigors of statutory
prohibitions, thereby creating a law on the ground that more closely
approximates popular preferences than the law on the books."); A.B.A.,
CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS FOR THE PROSECUTION FUNCTION, r. 3-1.2(b)
("The prosecutor serves the public interest and should act with
integrity and balanced judgment to increase public safety both by
pursuing appropriate criminal charges of appropriate severity, and by
exercising discretion not to pursue criminal charges in appropriate
circumstances.").

This unregulated discretion is what gives prosecutors the power not to
bring charges even when they could prove a person\'s guilt. Many
prosecutor offices around the country now have presumptive
nonprosecution policies for various kinds of offenses, from drug or
weapon possession to newly constitutional crimes related to provision of
abortion services. For examples of state prosecutors\' policy explaining
rationales for not prosecuting some wrongdoing, see the Philadelphia
District Attorney\'s Office policy statement on \"[Alternatives to
Incarceration](https://phillyda.org/safety-and-justice/alternatives-to-prosecution-incarceration/)\";

United States v. Kupa, 976 F. Supp. 2d 417 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)

 

John Gleeson, District Judge:

... This statement of reasons \[for a sentencing order\] relates to an
important subset of the drug offense mandatory minimum cases---those in
which prosecutors use or threaten to use their power to file prior
felony informations pursuant to [21 U.S.C. §
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L).
Those prior felony informations dramatically increase already-harsh
mandatory minimum sentences.

My focus here is narrow and my point is simple: as the defendant Lulzim
Kupa\'s case and countless others show, the government abuses its power
to file prior felony informations in drug trafficking cases. The single
most important factor that influences the government\'s decision whether
to file or threaten to file a prior felony information (or to withdraw
or promise to withdraw one that has previously been filed) is
illegitimate. When it enacted [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
in 1970, Congress had in mind the world ... in which federal prosecutors
would carefully cull from the large number of defendants with prior drug
felony convictions the hardened, professional drug traffickers who
should face recidivism enhancements upon conviction. But instead federal
prosecutors exercise their discretion by reference to a factor that
passes in the night with culpability: whether the defendant pleads
guilty. To coerce guilty pleas, and sometimes to coerce cooperation as
well, prosecutors routinely threaten ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory
sentences that *no one*---not even the prosecutors themselves---thinks
are appropriate. And to demonstrate to defendants generally that those
threats are sincere, prosecutors insist on the imposition of the unjust
punishments when the threatened defendants refuse to plead guilty.

Prior felony informations don\'t just tinker with sentencing outcomes
.... The government\'s use of them coerces guilty pleas and produces
sentences so excessively severe they take your breath away. Prior felony
informations have played a key role in helping to place the federal
criminal trial on the endangered species list.

 ...\[A\]s long as the powers currently conferred on prosecutors to
enhance drug trafficking mandatory minimums exist, they should not be
used for the indefensible purposes of coercing guilty pleas and
punishing those who go to trial. ... DOJ\'s policy regarding prior
felony informations has been unsound and brutally unfair for more than
two decades....

The Anti--Drug Abuse Act of 1986 ("ADAA") ... created a five-year
mandatory minimum, with a maximum enlarged from 20 to 40 years (the
"5--40 count" or the "five-year mandatory minimum") for the managers of
drug enterprises. It created a ten-year mandatory minimum, with life as
the maximum (the "10--life count" or the "ten-year mandatory minimum"),
for the organizers and kingpins. But right from the start Congress made
a mistake: the severe sentences it mandated to punish the specific
*roles* in drug-trafficking offenses were triggered not by role but by
drug type and quantity instead. ... So if an offense happens to involve
a drug type and quantity that triggers a mandatory minimum, *every*
defendant involved in that crime, whatever his or her actual role, can
be treated like a leader or manager at the option of the United States
Attorney....

[21 U.S.C. §
841](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS841&FindType=L)
ratchets up the mandatory minimums for recidivist drug offenders.
Specifically, it provides that where a defendant was previously
convicted of a felony drug offense, the five-year and ten-year mandatory
minimums are doubled.  For a defendant with two or more prior drug
felonies, the ten-year mandatory minimum is increased to mandatory life
in prison.  The term "felony drug offense" is defined very broadly.
[^ ^](#X366b462943ad7267c68944afe0e1b4d1689e1cf) Even low-level drug
possession convictions that produce probationary sentences qualify. And
recency is irrelevant; even convictions so old the Guidelines do not
include them in a defendant\'s criminal history score count. In short,
the second most severe sentence in our system---mandatory life
imprisonment---can be triggered by two ancient and minor drug
convictions that do not even constitute felonies under federal law.

\[In 1970, Congress amended\] [21 U.S.C. §
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
... \[which\] provides that no drug trafficking defendant can face an
enhanced mandatory minimum unless certain procedures, including the
filing of a prior felony information by the prosecutor, are followed.
 Unless the prosecutor files a timely prior felony information pursuant
to [21 U.S.C. §
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
listing the prior felony or felonies to be relied upon, the enhanced
mandatory minimums will not apply. ...

In sum, [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
reflected the recognition by Congress and DOJ that a prior drug felony
conviction was not *per se* evidence that a drug trafficking defendant
was the sort of hardened professional criminal who deserves an enhanced
mandatory sentence. Congress left it to prosecutors to identify the
defendants who truly deserved the enhancements that remained after 1970.
Whereas the previous statutory scheme made no distinctions among (for
example) professional criminals, street-corner dealers, and addicts
whose pay for participating in the offense consisted solely of the drugs
to support their habits, [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
trusted prosecutors to take into account such individual circumstances,
vesting them with the power to be selective.

There was no suggestion that Congress enacted [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
so prosecutors could use their newfound discretion to trigger enhanced
punishments as a tool to strong-arm federal defendants into pleading
guilty or to punish those who exercise their right to a trial....
Neither the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 \[which created the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines\] nor the ADAA disturbed [21 U.S.C. §
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L).
... \[T\]hose recidivist enhancements were not to be automatically
imposed on every drug trafficking defendant with a qualifying prior
conviction. Rather, federal prosecutors were supposed to continue to
exercise the discretion they asked for and received in [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
to cull from the large number of defendants who have prior drug
convictions the ones who truly deserve those extra-harsh punishments.
\....

The ... Guidelines took sentencing power from judges and placed it in
the hands of prosecutors. Prosecutors found themselves in a position
where they could influence sentencing outcomes through their charging
decisions and plea bargaining. DOJ welcomed the Sentencing Guidelines
....

In 2003, ... Attorney General John Ashcroft adopted a policy (the
"Ashcroft Policy") that further cemented the use of prior felony
informations in a way that was flatly contrary to the essential purpose
of [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L).
In a memorandum issued to all federal prosecutors on September 22, 2003,
the Attorney General ... directed them "to charge and to pursue the most
serious, readily provable offense," which was defined as the offense
generating the "most substantial sentence."
[^ ^](#Xc18beb026b340b5f52538c209185e8fa1f6e625) The memorandum also
specifically addressed prior felony informations, "strongly
encourag\[ing\]" their use since they always increase a sentence.
 Prosecutors were directed to file them in all instances unless there
was some "good faith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the
Government\'s ability readily to prove" the underlying facts.  And of
course prior convictions are virtually always readily provable.

Finally, the Ashcroft Policy not only legitimized the abusive use of
prior felony informations to coerce guilty pleas, it virtually directed
it. The memorandum expressly acknowledged that a prior felony
information produces "in many cases" a statutory sentence harsher than
the applicable guidelines range.
[^ ^](#Xc8a56b3b832d177d92c362ffeef14cbb901ff9e) In those circumstances,
prosecutors were permitted by the policy to "forego the filing" of the
prior felony information in a written plea agreement to give a defendant
an "incentive to plead guilty." ...

1.  ***How the Government Abuses its Power to File Prior Felony
    Informations ...***

2.  *Using Prior Felony Informations to Coerce Guilty Pleas---Lulzim
    Kupa*

Because there is no judicial check on the enhanced mandatory minimums
prosecutors can inject into a case, they can put enormous pressure on
defendants to plead guilty. In many cases only a daring risk-taker can
withstand that pressure. Most people buckle under it, and Luzlim Kupa is
a perfect example.

 Kupa was 36 years old when I sentenced him on August 9, 2013. He was
born in Staten Island to parents who had recently come to the United
States from Albania. In 1999 and again in 2007 Kupa was convicted of
conspiring to distribute marijuana. When he emerged from prison in 2010
after the second conviction, he engaged in drug trafficking again,
leading to this case. Kupa was charged with a 10--life count based on
the fact that more than five kilograms of cocaine were involved in the
offense.

 On March 5, 2013 the government sent Kupa a proposed plea agreement.
[^ ^](#X617adadb13cb8ef4506b99d1c506f6195fd8879) Despite Kupa\'s prior
marijuana convictions and several other convictions as well---he has a
serious criminal history---the agreement promised a withdrawal of the
10--life count and a recommendation to the Court of a sentence within
the range of 110--137 months if Kupa would plead guilty. Assuming good
time credits, a sentence at the bottom end of the recommended range
would result in Kupa serving about seven years and ten months in prison.
[^ ^](#Xa8bfea841827eb8da40fd0334b2e2574258ac54) The email that conveyed
the proposed plea agreement stipulated that the offer would expire the
next day.

 Kupa did not accept the agreement and the case appeared to be headed
toward the previously-scheduled April 22, 2013 trial. However, the
government wasn\'t finished encouraging him to plead guilty. On March
15, 2013 it filed a prior felony information providing notice of the two
marijuana convictions. Just like that, a defendant for whom the
government, only ten days earlier, was willing to recommend an effective
sentence of less than eight years was looking at life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

Standing alone, the prior felony information was hardly an inducement to
plead guilty. If the judge must sentence a defendant to life in prison
upon conviction, there\'s not much reason for him to plead guilty. But
the government quickly followed the filing of the prior felony
information with another proposed plea agreement, which was conveyed to
Kupa\'s lawyer on April 4, 2013. That proposal offered to withdraw both
the 10--year mandatory minimum and the prior felony information that had
turned that mandatory minimum into a mandatory life count if Kupa would
plead guilty. It also manipulated the Guidelines range estimate to raise
the recommended range to 130--162 months.
[^ ^](#X936110731feb20fda4e897082e660d4b4bf9aac) A sentence at the
bottom of that range amounts to an effective sentence of about nine
years and four months.

So the plea agreement proposed on April 4, 2013 did two things. First,
it punished Kupa for not accepting the previous agreement by providing
for a sentencing recommendation that, if accepted, would give him
another year and a half or so in prison. But it also gave him some
dramatic relief. For the preceding 19 days Kupa was facing mandatory
life in prison if he was found guilty, and the proposed plea agreement
offered an escape from that daunting prospect---as long as he agreed to
plead guilty.

 Kupa was given a single day to accept that agreement as well, and he
didn\'t act quickly enough. With the trial fast approaching, the
government forwarded yet another proposed plea agreement on April 9,
2013. Once again, the "estimated" Guidelines range and corresponding
recommendation were ratcheted slightly upwards; this time Kupa lost the
third "acceptance of responsibility" level that the government had added
to his previous agreement.  The upshot: the agreement provided for a
recommended range of 140--175 months, an effective prison term of 10
years.

So Kupa found himself in a difficult position as his trial approached.
Looming in the background was the reality that if he went to trial and
the jury convicted him, the law would require that he die in prison. And
with each passing day the sentence the government was willing to
recommend was creeping upward. If I were to sentence at the bottom end
of the government\'s recommended range in the final proposed plea
agreement, the five-week delay from March 5 to April 9, 2013 had already
cost Kupa over two years in prison.

On April 10, 2013 Kupa finally caved and entered a plea of guilty. He
told me at the time that he wanted to eliminate the potential downside
of life in prison by pleading guilty.  Also, referring to the steady
increases in the sentences recommended in the last three proposed plea
agreements, he said, "I want to plead guilty, your Honor, before things
get worse." [^ ^](#Xf6818eb0ff2eb6ad99484cb2c3616c417843d9f) The
voluntariness of a defendant\'s plea of guilty is an interesting issue
when the cost of going to trial is three or more decades in prison.
Nevertheless, I found Kupa\'s plea to be voluntary and accepted it.

The 140--175 month range was jointly recommended by the parties. For
various reasons I have elaborated upon elsewhere, negotiated agreements
like Kupa\'s are essentially sentence bargains.  I saw no reason not to
accept the bargain between the government and Kupa. Kupa will complete
his 11--year sentence, taking into account good time, when he is about
45 years of age.
[^ ^](#X4bc11b09a0c9915b19ff5f087e6061a2b655268) Assuming he lives to
the age of 75, his trial penalty would have been 30 years in prison if
he had proceeded to trial and the jury had found him guilty.

... Despite the government\'s patter, there was only one individualized
consideration that mattered in his case, and it was flat-out
dispositive: Was Kupa insisting on a trial or not? If he was, he would
have to pay for a nonviolent drug offense with a mandatory life
sentence, a sentence no one could reasonably argue was justified.

In defending its use of the prior felony information, the AUSAs\' letter
went on to identify the results of the individualized assessment in
Kupa\'s case: He had a lengthy criminal history, and much of the conduct
underlying his prior convictions occurred while Kupa was serving terms
of supervised release. Those facts supposedly triggered the filing of
the prior felony information.  But even though the government knew those
facts a year earlier, it did not file a prior felony information until
he refused to plead guilty a few weeks before trial. And even though
Kupa still had that criminal history when he showed up for sentencing,
by then the prior felony information had been withdrawn. Why? Because he
buckled under its pressure and agreed to forgo a trial. That\'s all that
mattered when it came to the prior felony information. The government\'s
letter claiming that something else was going on revealed an
uncharacteristic lack of candor. The silver lining to the dissembling is
that it suggests an understanding by the prosecutors in this district
that the use to which the prior felony information was put in Kupa\'s
case is not a proper one. ...

Though the power to file a prior felony information eventually produced
the intended effect of squeezing Kupa into pleading guilty, it took
longer in his case than in most cases. Indeed, one of the many problems
associated with tracking the use of prior felony informations is
defendants often plead guilty in response to the *threat* that one will
be filed, producing an outcome that is very much the result of this
prosecutorial power without any record of its use. The Federal Defender
for both the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York has described
how it works as follows: "If the client has a prior qualifying
conviction, and is considering trial or a motion, the prosecutors will
threaten to file a 'prior felony information' that will double the
mandatory minimum. Few clients have the stomach to push back against
those threats (which are not idle)."

Still, not all defendants buckle when prosecutors threaten to punish
them for going to trial by filing prior felony informations. Some
actually insist on their constitutional rights. In those circumstances,
prosecutors believe they have little choice but to go ahead and file the
prior felony informations. "Plea bargaining is what academics call a
'repeat-play' game; the same lawyers negotiate pleas again and again. A
prosecutor who becomes known as a pushover will be taken advantage of,
not once but many times." That can\'t be allowed to happen, so those who
call the prosecutors on their threat have to pay. Otherwise, as an
Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Massachusetts has
explained it, "you lose some credibility going forward." As described
below, the costs of maintaining prosecutorial credibility can be
jarring.

2.  *Prior Felony Informations to Punish Those Who Refuse to Plead
    Guilty*

Tyquan Midyett turned 26 years old during the period he participated in
user-quantity sales of crack in the Marcy Houses here in Brooklyn.
Midyett\'s life story is all too familiar---broken home, foster care,
high school dropout, and a long history of substance abuse. He began
using marijuana at age 14, and smoked four "blunts" a day until he was
arrested in December 2007.

Early in the case, the prosecutor sent Midyett a proposed plea agreement
setting forth the government\'s version of the advisory Guidelines
range. Taking into account Midyett\'s minor role in the offense, the
100:1 cocaine to crack ratio then in effect, and Midyett\'s prior
conviction in state court for criminal sale of a controlled substance,
the plea agreement stated his range would be 78--97 months in prison if
he pled guilty. However, as the prosecutor pointed out in the cover
letter to the proposed plea agreement, Midyett had been charged with a
10--life count, so even if he pled guilty the best he could do at
sentencing was a ten-year prison term. The prosecutor offered to
recommend that sentence to the court.

The offer to recommend a sentence almost three and a half years *above*
the lower end of a Guidelines range computed under the much-maligned
100:1 regime didn\'t give Midyett much of an incentive to plead guilty.
As the case approached trial, the prosecutor needed to make a plea of
guilty more attractive to him. So he told Midyett\'s counsel that if
Midyett didn\'t plead guilty by a specified date, the government would
file a prior felony information, which would double the mandatory
minimum to 20 years.

... Midyett still wanted to put the government to its proof. So that\'s
what he did, and the government followed through with its threat by
filing the prior felony information. The trial happened, Midyett was
found guilty, and in June of 2010 another judge in this district
sentenced him to the mandatory 20--year prison term. ... But the United
States Attorney made any sentence below ten years legally impossible by
bringing a 10--life count, conferring kingpin status on Midyett despite
the government\'s own assertion in the proposed plea agreement that he
played only a minor role in the crime.  ...

 

3.  *Abuse of Power to File Prior Felony Informations is Widespread and
    Longstanding*

As mentioned above, it\'s difficult to gather data about the use of
prior felony informations. Because a prosecutor\'s oral threat to file
one is often sufficient to prod a defendant into pleading guilty, there
is usually no record of its role in the case. Still, there is plenty of
documentary evidence that the use of prior felony informations to coerce
pleas and inflict trial penalties is widespread, in this district and
elsewhere. \[T\]here are different ways to use them as sledgehammers.
One is to withhold the filing of a prior information and threaten to
file it if the guilty plea isn\'t forthcoming. Another is to just file
one ahead of time and then, as the case gets close to trial, condition a
promise to withdraw it on the defendant pleading guilty. ...

The use of prior felony informations to coerce guilty pleas is common
around the country. The Sentencing Commission\'s 2011 report to Congress
on mandatory minimums revealed that the vast majority of both
prosecutors and defense attorneys reported that filing notices under [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
was part of plea negotiations. The Commission visited thirteen
districts, conducting interviews with defense attorneys and prosecutors.
 The prosecutors in nine of those districts admitted that they "delayed
filing the \[[§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)\]
notice while engaging in plea negotiations;" in "many" of those
districts, defense attorneys described the delay as a "threat" to
"coerce" a plea.  ...

Even the truly egregious miscarriages of justice are too numerous to
catalog here, but a few more examples may help to place the duration and
depth of the problem in clearer relief.

Kenneth Harvey came along quite early in the era of excessive severity.
He was 24 years old in 1989, when he committed the crack cocaine offense
that resulted in a 10--life charge in the Western District of Missouri.
He had two priors that qualified as felony drug convictions even though,
as his sentencing judge put it, they "were not deemed serious enough to
merit imprisonment and appear to be only technically within the
statutory punishment plan." He went to trial and lost, and because the
government filed a prior felony information listing both convictions,
Harvey got life for selling drugs with a wholesale value of less than
\$10,000.

The sentencing judge noted that bank robbers with much more serious
records generally served less than ten years in prison, and ...
recommended executive clemency after 15 years.... Today Kenneth Harvey
is 48, well past the point when he should have received clemency, and
his request for it has been denied.  He is more than 20 years into his
life sentence for a low-level, nonviolent drug trafficking crime.

Melissa Ross\'s boyfriend got arrested for conspiring to distribute
cocaine and crack. After his arrest, she assisted by housing fugitives,
collecting money, and distributing drugs, leading to a 10--life
conspiracy charge against Ross. Right off the bat, the government,
"recognizing that \[Ross\] was a minor participant in \[the\]
conspiracy," offered to withdraw the 10--life count if she would plead
guilty to misprision of a felony and serve a three-year prison sentence.
 She refused, and as the sentencing judge described it, the prosecutor
"vindictively filed the [§
851](http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=1000546&DocName=21USCAS851&FindType=L)
enhancement because \[Ross\] asserted her constitutional right to trial
by jury." [^ ^](#Xe0dc26e79be4621b31e6b01c7d3a133415747d7) As a result,
the drug dealer\'s girlfriend---the paradigmatic minor player---is now
doing 20 years instead of the three the government initially
proposed....

\[There\] are countless similar examples .... And ... the truth is that
tangible injustices that should shame us all frequently happen on a
smaller scale, which unfortunately makes them easier to overlook. In
*United States v. Wahl,* for example, the prior felony information had
the relatively minor effect of doubling the five-year mandatory minimum.
 In an era where so many sentences are decades too long and too often
require nonviolent drug trafficking defendants to die in prison, a
measly five more years for a drug trafficker on his second conviction
may seem from the outside like a minor problem or no problem at all. But
in reality it is a huge problem. Judging is removed, prosecutors become
sentencers, drug addicts are warehoused instead of treated,  prisons
swell beyond their capacities, enormous unnecessary costs are incurred,
futures and families and communities are ruined.

... Upon imposing \[Wahl's\] ten-year sentence required by the
prosecutor\'s filing of a prior felony information, \[the judge\] stated
as follows:

I have no discretion here\.... When it comes to these charging
decisions, in many cases a line prosecutor \... has more authority than
I do because he\'s the one that charges these offenses and that drives
these mandatory minimums and I\'m just a figurehead. I\'m just a rubber
stamp. I\'m not sure why they pay me as much as they do to engage in
this fiasco because I can\'t imagine if you got 20 educated people in a
room and looked at this situation that one out of 20 would give this
young man 10 years in prison\.... I don\'t think it\'s fair or
appropriate\.... I think the last figures I read, over 55 percent of all
federal inmates are there on drug related charges. The vast majority of
these people are not violent. They\'re not engaged in high-level
trafficking. They\'re people who have addiction problems\.... \[T\]o the
extent that we\'re spending fortunes now warehousing people like Mr.
Wahl for growing marijuana plants is patently ridiculous in my view\....

 

1.  ***The Damage Caused by the Government\'s Use of Prior Felony
    Informations***

\[W\]hat\'s wrong with a statutory regime that is very effective in
getting drug trafficking defendants to plead guilty? Actually, there\'s
a lot wrong with it.

First, it results in the imposition of excessive sentences. ... Second,
the greater the trial penalty in any plea bargaining situation, the
greater the risk that innocent people will plead guilty. If Kupa had
gone to trial and lost, his trial penalty would have been the rest of
his life beyond age 45, which is when he will get out of prison based on
the sentence I imposed. When guilty plea discounts are that dramatic and
that certain, some innocent people will plead guilty....

Third, even if the government\'s use of prior felony informations
accomplished nothing other than the inducement of guilty pleas from
actually guilty people, it would still be an undesirable outcome. Trials
have become rare events in our system. In 1980, 81% of federal
convictions were the product of guilty pleas.
[^ ^](#X7fcdb3526b748c625327d45846b890b93869473)Now that number is 97%.

An excessively high rate of guilty pleas is unhealthy for our justice
system. It reduces transparency and for that reason alone diminishes the
quality of justice.  The sentencing outcomes after defendants are
convicted at trial ought to be the benchmarks for sentencing outcomes in
cases where the defendant has pled guilty. But when almost everyone
pleads guilty, the norm is not what happens after trial but rather the
sentences resulting from the plea agreements themselves.

In addition, when only 3% of sentenced defendants have gone to trial, it
is no longer an efficient use of a prosecutor\'s time to prepare her
case for trial prior to indictment. If all you\'ll ever need is the
probable cause necessary to indict, there\'s not much incentive to
develop more than probable cause.
[^ ^](#Xe92bde17337d6fc788a98b9433377ea1c2bce2e) Since plea agreements
are generally conditioned on prompt guilty pleas, no motion practice,
and minimal Rule 16 disclosure, many cases receive only the scrutiny the
grand jury process affords. It\'s important to bear in mind just how
shallow that scrutiny is. ...

The problem is not limited to the absence of *adversarial* challenges to
indicted cases. *Prosecutors* will pay exquisite attention to the
details of a case only during trial preparation. Preparing a case for
trial is extremely labor-intensive for them and the agents working with
them---indeed, that\'s why prosecutors use the powers Congress and the
Sentencing Commission gave them to avoid trials. When preparing for
trial, they actually debrief all the witnesses, find more witnesses,
subpoena additional documentary evidence, and go back over all the
evidence they already had. The results significantly enhance both the
quantity and quality of the information that was available at the time
of indictment. That can strengthen the case and even suggest the
appropriateness of additional and more serious charges and even
additional defendants. But it can also have the opposite effect,
unearthing facts that call the charges into question or warrant leniency
even if the charges are sound.

I don\'t mean to suggest that because criminal trials are disappearing
federal prosecutors are running wild, obtaining indictments based on
illegally seized evidence and withholding exculpatory material from
grand juries. I have no reason to believe they act in anything other
than good faith in their grand jury presentations. But in a world where
97% of sentenced defendants plead guilty pursuant to agreements that
require such pleas to occur before the prosecutor prepares the case for
trial, the sharpened focus on the offense and the defendant that results
from such trial preparation rarely occurs. The thin presentation needed
for indictment is hardly ever subjected to closer scrutiny by
prosecutors, defense counsel, judges or juries. The entire system loses
an edge, and I have no doubt that the quality of justice in our
courthouses has suffered as a result....

 

 

 

Prosecution and Mass Incarceration

 

Adam Gopnik, *How We Misunderstand Mass Incarceration*, New
[Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/how-we-misunderstand-mass-incarceration),
April 3, 2017:

... In recent years, the horror of what Americans have done to other
Americans---and particularly white Americans to black Americans---has
led to a steady, engaged anti-prison polemic, one with many authors
singing more or less in unison. The numbers make their own case: 6.7
million people, mostly men, were under correctional supervision during
the year 2015---more than were enslaved in antebellum America and more
than resided in the Gulag Archipelago at the height of Stalin's misrule.

... The standard story, as \[Professor John Pfaff\] sees it, insists
that, first, the root cause of incarceration is the racist persecution
of young black men for drug crimes, which overpopulates the prisons with
nonviolent offenders. Then mandatory-sentencing laws leave offenders
serving long prison sentences for relatively minor crimes. This hugely
expanded prison population, one that tracks in reverse the decline of
actual crime, has led to a commerce in caged men---private-prison
contractors, and a specialized lobby in favor of prison construction,
which in turn demands men to feed into the system....

Pfaff ... believes that the standard story---popularized in particular
by Michelle Alexander, in her influential book, "*The New Jim
Crow*"---is false. ... First, he inspects the claim that it is
predominantly nonviolent drug offenders, imprisoned against all moral
logic, who populate our prisons.... In fact, Pfaff argues, drug
convictions are a distinctly secondary factor in prison growth. During
the great wave of incarceration---generally thought to have begun around
1980 and cresting about three decades later---state prisons added
something like a million inmates, with about "half that growth coming
from locking up more people convicted of violence," Pfaff calculates.
Nonviolent drug offenses accounted for only around a fifth of the new
incarcerations.

... He accepts that "blacks are systematically denied access to the more
successful paths to economic stability," and therefore "face
systematically greater pressure to turn to other alternatives." But he
also makes a more complicated argument, following recent sociological
research: it's not that the prohibition of drugs attracts crime, which
then produces violence; it's that violence thrives among young men
deprived of a faith in their own upward mobility, making drug dealing an
attractive business. In plain English, young men without a way out of
poverty turn to gangs, and gangs always turn to violence. Since
efficient drug dealing is, by its illicit nature, likely to involve
violence, those accustomed to violence are drawn to drug dealing. ...

\[T\]he war on drugs, however misguided as social policy, was not, Pfaff
insists, a prime mover of the epidemic of incarceration---the numbers
just aren't there. ... What about mandatory sentences? Pfaff notes that
these outsized punishments are given to a very small part of the actual
prison population. Most new inmates are serving relatively short
sentences. This, Pfaff observes, is essentially good news. "Prison
admissions are a flow, not a stock," he writes. "They depend far more on
choices made today than on the lingering effects of thousands of past
decisions." ... \[And\] even if private prisons were banned tomorrow and
all their inmates released, the prison population would drop by, at
most, eight per cent. The numbers just aren't there.

So what makes for the madness of American incarceration? ... Pfaff has a
simple explanation: it's prosecutors. They are political creatures, who
get political rewards for locking people up and almost unlimited power
to do it.

Pfaff ... points to a surprising pattern. While violent crime was
increasing by a hundred per cent between 1970 and 1990, the number of
"line" prosecutors rose by only seventeen per cent. But between 1990 and
2007, while the crime rate began to fall, the number of line prosecutors
went up by fifty per cent, and the number of prisoners rose with it.
That fact may explain the central paradox of mass incarceration: fewer
crimes, more criminals; less wrongdoing to imprison people for, more
people imprisoned....

Meanwhile, prosecutors grew more powerful. "There is basically no limit
to how prosecutors can use the charges available to them to threaten
defendants," Pfaff observes. That's why mandatory-sentencing rules can
affect the justice system even if the mandatory minimums are relatively
rarely enforced. A defendant, forced to choose between a thirty-year
sentence if convicted of using a gun in a crime and pleading to a lesser
drug offense, is bound to cop to the latter. Some ninety-five per cent
of criminal cases in the U.S. are decided by plea bargains---the risk of
being convicted of a more serious offense and getting a much longer
sentence is a formidable incentive---and so prosecutors can determine
another man's crime and punishment while scarcely setting foot in a
courtroom....

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

***Sentencing, prosecutorial discretion, and plea bargaining***:

Judge Gleeson's opinion in *Kupa* highlights some key features of the
criminal legal system that you should keep in mind when studying the
upcoming materials in this book. For the most part, our focus will be on
"substantive criminal law"---definition of various criminal offenses,
and how courts and lawyers resolve the sometimes-tricky questions about
what precisely must be proved to find a person guilty of a crime. But
*Kupa* makes clear some important features of criminal law
administration that are always in the background of enforcing criminal
law.

One point to note is that the question of whether someone is guilty of a
crime is distinct from what the guilty person's punishment should be. A
related point is who has the largest role in deciding what the
punishment will be---prosecutors, judges, the legislature by enacting
sentencing laws? *Kupa* is an example of how mandatory sentencing
statutes shift much of the de facto sentencing power to prosecutors,
because prosecutors can use their unfettered discretionary authority
file charges for which harsh sentences are mandatory, or conversely to
file charges that result in much more moderate outcomes, and which leave
judges with greater discretion over the final sentence.

Yet another feature of criminal law administration described in *Kupa*
is the practice of plea bargaining. In both state and federal courts,
the overwhelming majority of convictions (usually more than 95 percent)
occur through guilty pleas rather than trials. *Kupa* illustrates a
particular sharp version of a widespread practice---encouraging (or
coercing) defendants to plead guilty by offering to drop some charges
and sentencing consequences, or by promising (or threatening) to add
more charges or sentencing consequences unless a defendant pleads
guilty. This is variously described as a "trial penalty"---harsher
treatment for defendants who exercise their right to a trial---or a
"plea discount"---more lenient treatment for those who waive their trial
right. One puzzle this practice creates determining the baseline of the
"correct" charge and sentence from which the other alternative outcome
deviates. If 97 percent of offenders (those who plead guilty) receive
one sentence, and the three precent who are convicted at trial receive
much more severe---but statutorily authorized---sentences for basically
the same conduct, which group received the appropriate or just sentence?

***Purposes of criminal punishment***:

The Supreme Court has noted that "\[a\] sentence can have a variety of
justifications, such as incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, or
rehabilitation." *Ewing v. California,* 538 U.S. 11, 25 (2003).
Deterrence (an incentive to desist from crime), incapacitation
(rendering one unable to commit crimes, e.g., because one is in prison),
and rehabilitation are relatively straightforward purposes. And they are
"instrumental" purposes, meaning their function is to bring about a
desired end or consequence---less criminal conduct. Retribution, in
contrast, is a normative or moral concept. Recall Professor Hart's point
that the distinctive feature of criminal law is "the moral condemnation
of the community." Briefly put, retribution captures the idea that
punishment should give an offender his "just deserts" (or perhaps *no
more than* his just deserts). A sentence should be by some measure
commensurate with the gravity of the crime; punishment should be
proportionate to the actor's wrongdoing and his culpability or moral
blameworthiness. "Proportionality---the notion that the punishment
should fit the crime---is inherently a concept tied to the penological
goal of retribution." *Id.* at 31 (Scalia, J., concurring).

Federal sentencing law reflects these multiple purposes of punishment.
See 18 U.S.C. § 3553:

\(a\) *Factors To Be Considered in Imposing a Sentence*. The court shall
impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply
with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The
court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall
consider---

1.  the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
    characteristics of the defendant;

2.  the need for the sentence imposed

A\) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for
the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense

B\) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;

C\) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and

D\) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational
training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most
effective manner ....

Consider whether these very different purposes for criminal punishment
are consistent with each other, or whether they all lead to a similar
conclusion about what the punishment should be for any particular
offender. Note that, as a principle, incapacitation (a means to "protect
the public from further crimes") has no necessary upper bound: a state
can prevent a person from doing crimes forever by keeping them in prison
forever (except perhaps for crimes that might be committed in prison).
And what is the upper bound for sentence that aims to deter future
wrongdoing? Does more punishment always yield more deterrence? (What is
an offender's incentive to desist from more criminal conduct once he has
committed a murder for which he knows he could get the death penalty?)
Should an offender whom we are confident is fully rehabilitated (however
we might reach that view) be released from prison regardless of whether
his incarceration meets some standard of morally proportionate
punishment?

The U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishment
Clause imposes a prohibition against "grossly disproportionate"
punishments. But determining whether a particular incarceration sentence
is disproportionate to what the offender "deserves" is in practice
exceedingly difficult. Partly for that reason, it is uncontroversial to
describe the Eighth Amendment's proportionality constraint on criminal
sentences as exceedingly weak in practice. See, e.g., Harmelin v.
Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991) (Michigan law that mandated a sentence of
life imprisonment without possibility of parole for simple possession of
672 grams of cocaine not unconstitutional). 

The exception to this characterization is in the context of the death
penalty and life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders and
mentally disabled offenders, which the Court has held are barred by the
Eighth Amendment. See Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002) (death
penalty barred for mentally disabled offenders); Roper v. Simmons, 543
U.S. 551 (2005) (same for those who committed murder before the age of
eighteen); Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010) (life-without-parole
sentences unconstitutional for juvenile offenders who commit crimes
other than homicide); Miller v. Alabama and Jackson v. Hobbs, 567 U.S.
460 (2012) (*mandatory* life-without-parole sentences are
unconstitutional for all crimes---including murder---committed by
juveniles, although judges may in their *discretion* impose sentence
teenage offenders to life without parole, or to decades-long sentences
that effectively can be life sentences).

***Effects of imprisonment***

Consider David J Harding, Jeffrey D Morenoff, Anh P Nguyen & Shawn D
Bushway, *[Short- and long-term effects of
imprisonment](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1701544114) on
future felony convictions and prison admissions*, 114(42) Proceedings
Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 11103-11108 (Oct. 2017).  Abstract:

A substantial contributor to prison admissions is the return of
individuals recently released from prison, which has come to be known as
prison\'s \"revolving door.\" However, it is unclear whether being
sentenced to prison itself has a causal effect on the probability of a
subsequent return to prison or on criminal behavior. To examine the
causal effect of being sentenced to prison on subsequent offending and
reimprisonment, we leverage a natural experiment using the random
assignment of judges with different propensities for sentencing
offenders to prison. Drawing on data on all individuals sentenced for a
felony in Michigan between 2003 and 2006, we compare individuals
sentenced to prison to those sentenced to probation, taking into account
sentence lengths and stratifying our analysis by race. Results show that
being sentenced to prison rather than probation increases the
probability of imprisonment in the first 3 years after release from
prison by 18 percentage points among nonwhites and 19 percentage points
among whites. Further results show that such effects are driven
primarily by imprisonment for technical violations of community
supervision rather than new felony convictions. This suggests that more
stringent postprison parole supervision (relative to probation
supervision) increases imprisonment through the detection and punishment
of low-level offending or violation behavior. Such behavior would not
otherwise result in imprisonment for someone who had not already been to
prison or who was not on parole. These results demonstrate that the
revolving door of prison is in part an effect of the nature of
postprison supervision.

LORD COLERIDGE, C.J. The two prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edwin
Stephens, were indicted for the murder of Richard Parker on the high
seas on the 25th of July in the present year. They were tried before my
Brother Huddleston at Exeter on the 6th of November, and, under the
direction of my learned Brother, the jury returned a special verdict,
the legal effect of which has been argued before us, and on which we are
now to pronounce judgment**\[ ... \]**

From these facts, stated with the cold precision of a special verdict,
it appears sufficiently that the prisoners were subject to terrible
temptation, to sufferings which might break down the bodily power of the
strongest man, and try the conscience of the best. Other details yet
more harrowing, facts still more loathsome and appalling, were presented
to the jury, and are to be found recorded in my learned Brother\'s
notes. But nevertheless this is clear, that the prisoners put to death a
weak and unoffending boy upon the chance of preserving their own lives
by feeding upon his flesh and blood after he was killed, and with the
certainty of depriving him, of any possible chance of survival. The
verdict finds in terms that \"if the men had not fed upon the body of
the boy they would probably not have survived,\" and that "the boy being
in a much weaker condition was likely to have died before them.\" They
might possibly have been picked up next day by a passing ship; they
might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is
obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and
profitless act. It is found by the verdict that the boy was incapable of
resistance, and, in fact, made none; and it is not even suggested that
his death was due to any violence on his part attempted against, or even
so much as feared by, those who killed him. Under these circumstances
the jury say that they are ignorant whether those who killed him were
guilty of murder, and have referred it to this Court to determine what
is the legal consequence which follows from the facts which they have
found**\[ ... \]**

.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

There remains to be considered the real question in the case whether
killing under the circumstances set forth in the verdict be or be not
murder. **\[ ... \]**.**\[ ... \]**. First it is said that it follows
from various definitions of murder in books of authority, which
definitions imply, if they do not state, the doctrine, that in order to
save your own life you may lawfully take away the life of another, when
that other is neither attempting nor threatening yours, nor is guilty of
any illegal act whatever towards you or any one else. But if these
definitions be looked at they will not be found to sustain this
contention.**\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

"If a man be desperately assaulted and in peril of death, and cannot
otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his assailant\'s fury, he will kill
an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force will not
acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit the fact,
for he ought rather to die himself than kill an innocent; but if he
cannot otherwise save his own life the law permits him in his own
defence to kill the assailant, for by the violence of the assault, and
the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself, the law of
nature, and necessity, hath made him his own protector cum debito modera
mine inculpatee tutelae.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. i. 51.)

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and
unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified
by some well-recognised excuse admitted by the law. It is further
admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing
was justified by what has been called "necessity." But the temptation to
the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called
necessity. Nor is this to be regretted. Though law and morality are not
the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily
illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal
consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder
in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it. It is not
so. To preserve one\'s life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be
the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of
instances in which it is a man\'s duty not to live, but to die. The
duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the
passengers, **\[ ... \]** these duties impose on men the moral
necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives
for others from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in
England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk. It is
not correct, therefore, to say that there is any absolute or unqualified
necessity to preserve one\'s life. **\[ ... \]**It is not needful to
point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been
contended for. Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity? By what
measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to be
strength, or intellect, or \'what? It is plain that the principle leaves
to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which will
justify him in deliberately taking another\'s life to save his own. In
this case the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting, was chosen.
Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? The answer
must be \"No\" --

> \"So spake the Fiend, and with necessity
>
> The tyrant\'s plea, excused his devilish deeds.\"

It is not suggested that in this particular case the deeds were
\"devilish,\" but it is quite plain that such a principle once admitted
might be made the legal cloak for unbridled passion and atrocious crime.
There is no safe path for judges to tread but to ascertain the law to
the best of their ability and to declare it according to their judgment;
and if in any case the law appears to be too severe on individuals, to
leave it to the Sovereign to exercise that prerogative of mercy which
the Constitution has intrusted to the hands fittest to dispense it.

It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an
excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how
awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment
straight and the conduct pure. We are often compelled to set up
standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we
could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare
temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it,
nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner
the legal definition of the crime. It is therefore our duty to declare
that the prisoners\' act in this case was wilful murder, that the facts
as stated in the verdict are no legal justification of the homicide; and
to say that in our unanimous opinion the prisoners are upon this special
verdict guilty of
murder.[^\[2\]^](#Xadc5b997a735929dc7acc18caff7c8b18b706ad)

Notes and Questions for Dudley and Stephens

 

Note this definition of the duress defense in the Criminal Code for
England and Wales (which had not been enacted yet at the time of *Dudley
and Stephens*):

Section (43) Duress of Circumstances

1\) A person is not guilty \...when he does an act under duress of
circumstances.

2\) A person acts under duress of circumstances if:

a\) he does act because he knows or believe that it is immediately
necessary to avoid death\...AND

b\) the danger he knows or believes to exist is such that\...he cannot
reasonably be expected to act otherwise.

3\) This section does not apply to a person who has knowingly and
without reasonable excuse exposed himself to the danger.

Would Section 43 provide Dudley and Stephens with a defense\--that is,
could a jury properly acquit them on the conclusion that they acted
under duress?

What outcome do you personally favor in the *Dudley and Stephens* case,
and why so? Consider the following options:

     a) Jury should convict the Ds as Murderers and impose the death
penalty (or, today, perhaps a life sentence)

     b) Jury should convict the Ds as Murderers but punish them lightly

     c) Jury should convict the Ds of some lesser offense, such as
manslaughter or abuse of a corpse

     d) Jury should convict the Ds, but then the Queen (or governor or
president) should pardon them or commute their sentences (i.e., let the
conviction stand but impose no punishment)

     e) Jury should acquit the Ds, because circumstances excuse their
actions

     f) Prosecutor should exercise her discretion not to prosecute
Dudley and Stephens

Consider the following background facts and whether any alters your
sense of the just outcome: 

     a) Richard Parker's family opposed prosecution, forgave Dudley in
open court, shaking his hand. His gravestone is a passage from Job:
"Though he slay me, yet I will trust him... Lord, lay not this sin to
their charge." 

     b) Prior to this fateful voyage, an inspector noticed rotted
"deadwood" (below the water line). Rather than replacing it with fresh
timber, the ship owner paid for repairs using the ship's own timber
(making for a cheaper but sloppier repair). 

     c) The *Mignonette* was widely rumored unsuitable for a long
voyage. Dudley, who was paid in lump sum by the ship's owner, with any
repairs to be paid out of his pocket, paid the crew higher than average
rates because of the perceived risk.

**     d) Public *response #1***: At the time of rescue, newspapers
stories recorded public outrage at Richard Parker's killing, along with
a demand for harsh punishment. 

**     e) Public *response #2***: Upon their conviction and sentencing
to die for the crime of murder, newspapers recorded public outcry for
compassion and a demand that Dudley and Stephens' lives be spared.

Legality, Vagueness and Interpretation

 

See Beth van Schaack, Crimen Sine Lege: *Judicial Lawmaking at the
Intersection of Law and Morals*, [97 Geo. L.J. 119,
119-120](https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1416&context=facpubs)
(2008):

One of the most fundamental defenses to a criminal prosecution is that
of *nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege* ("no crime without
law, no punishment without law"). In its simplest translation, this
Latin maxim asserts the ex post facto prohibition: that conduct must be
criminalized and penalties fixed in advance of any criminal prosecution.
More broadly, the maxim is also invoked in connection with corollary
legislative and interpretive principles compelling criminal statutes to
be drafted with precision (the principle of specificity), to be strictly
construed without extension by analogy, and to have ambiguities resolved
in favor of the accused (the principle of lenity or *in dubio pro reo*).
Together, these precepts undergird the principle of legality and serve
several purposes: ensuring that individuals are capable of obtaining
notice of prescribed conduct so they can rationally adjust their
behavior to avoid sanction; protecting the citizenry from arbitrary or
oppressive state action in the face of ambiguities or gaps in the law;
and effectuating the expressive purposes of the law by clearly
articulating conduct that is collectively condemned. The principle of
*nullum crimen sine lege* writ large thus embodies "an essential element
of the rule of law" by speaking to the very legitimacy of a legal rule,
providing a check on the power of all branches of government over
individuals, and policing the separation of powers by ensuring
legislative primacy in substantive rulemaking. Indeed, Alexander
Hamilton recognized violations of the principle as "the favorite and
most formidable instruments of tyranny."

Today, most crimes are defined by statutes, which in theory ensures
adherence to the legality principle by giving people advance notice of
what conduct the law prohibits. Yet some statutes are broadly,
ambiguously, or vaguely worded; many statutes require interpretation to
understand their meaning in particular contexts and applications.
Ordinary people may need to interpret statutes in order to figure out
whether their conduct is legal; police and prosecutors must interpret
statutes in order to conclude whether they can arrest or charge a person
for conduct that they believe violated a statute. Ultimately, courts\'
interpretation of criminal statutes are definitive, and for this reason
case law\--in addition to a statute\'s text\--continues to be an
important source the understanding the precise meaning of criminal law.
As cases in this chapter illustrate, the Constitution is understood to
prohibit excessively \"vague\" statutes, so courts occasionally hold
that statutes are \"void for vagueness.\" But more often, courts use a
variety of tools\--sometimes called \'canons\' of interpretation or
construction\--to interpret statutes whose meanings are in some respect
unclear or uncertain, without invalidating them as excessively vague. As
the next case, *Nash,* illustrates, statutes can be quite vague by any
ordinary standard and yet not deemed to be *unconstitutionally* vague.

 

 

 

 

Nash v. United States

 

Supreme Court of the United States

229 U.S. 373 (1913)

Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an indictment in two counts --- the first for a conspiracy in
restraint of trade, the second for a conspiracy to monopolize trade,
contrary to the act of. July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, commonly
known as the Sherman Act.\...

The allegations of fact in the two counts are alike. Summed up in
narrative form they are as follows: The American Naval Stores Company, a
West Virginia corporation having its principal office in Savannah and
branch offices in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc., was, engaged in
buying, selling, shipping and exporting spirits of turpentine in and
from Southern States, to other States and abroad. Nash was the
president; Shotter, chairman of the board of directors; Myers,
vice-president; Boardman, treasurer; DeLoach, secretary, and Moller,
manager of the Jacksonville, Florida, branch. The National
Transportation and Terminal Company, a New Jersey corporation, had
warehouses and terminals for handling spirits of turpentine and naval
stores at Fernandina, and other places named, in Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, etc., and was engaged in storing such turpentine and rosin
and issuing warehouse receipts for the same. Myers was the president;
DeLoach the secretary and Moller manager of the Jacksonville branch. On
May 1, 1907, it is alleged, these corporations and individuals conspired
to restrain commerce in the articles named, among the States and with
foreign nations --- the restraint to be effected in the following ways
among others: (1) by bidding down turpentine and rosin so that
competitors could sell them only at ruinous prices; (2) by causing naval
stores receipts that naturally would go to one port to go to another;
(3) by purchasing thereafter a large part of 'its' supplies at ports
known as closed ports and, with intent to depress the market, refraining
from purchasing any appreciable part at Savannah, the primary market in
the United States for naval stores, where purchases would tend to
strengthen prices, the defendants taking the receipts at the closed
ports named on a basis of the market at Savannah; (4) by coercing
factors and brokers into contracts with the defendants for the storage
and purchase of their receipts and refusing to purchase from such
factors and brokers unless such contracts were entered into; (5) by
circulating false statements as to naval stores production and stocks on
hand; (6) by issuing fraudulent warehouse receipts; (7) by fraudulently
grading, regrading and raising grades of rosins and falsely gauging
spirits of turpentine; (8) by attempting to bribe employees of
competitors so as to obtain information concerning their business and
stocks; (9) by inducing consumers, by payments and threats of boycotts,
to postpone dates of delivery of contract supplies and thus enabling
defendants to postpone purchasing when to purchase would tend to
strengthen the market; (10) by making tentative offers of large amounts
of naval stores to depress the market, accepting contract only for small
amounts and purchasing when the market had been depressed by the offers;
(11) by selling far below cost in order to compel competitors to meet
prices ruinous to everybody; (12) by fixing the price of turpentine
below the cost of production --- all the foregoing being for the purpose
of driving competitors out of business and restraining foreign trade or,
in the second count, of doing the same and monopolizing the trade.

The two counts before us were demurred to on the grounds that the
statute was so vague* *as to be inoperative on its criminal side\....
The demurrer was overruled and this action of the court raises the
important questions of the case\....

The objection to the criminal operation of the statute is thought to be
warranted by *The Standard Oil Co.* v. *United States,* 221 U.S. 1, and
*United States* v. *American Tobacco Co.,* 221 U.S. 106. Those cases may
be taken to have established that only such contracts and combinations
are within the act as, by reason of intent or the inherent nature of the
contemplated acts, prejudice the public interests by unduly restricting
competition or unduly obstructing, the course of trade. 221 U.S. 179.
And thereupon it is said that the crime thus defined by the statute
contains in its definition an element of degree as to which estimates
may differ, with the; result that a man might find himself in prison
because his honest judgment did not anticipate that of a jury of less
competent men. The kindred proposition that "the criminality of an act
cannot depend upon whether a jury may think it reasonable or
unreasonable. There must be some definiteness and certainty" is cited
from the late Mr. Justice Brewer sitting in the Circuit Court. *Tozer*
v. *United States,* 52 Fed. Rep. 917, 919.

But apart from the common law as to restraint of trade thus taken up by
the statute the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on
his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it,
some matter of degree. If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a
fine or a short imprisonment, as here; he may incur the penalty of
death. "An act causing death may be murder, manslaughter, or
misadventure according to the degree of danger attending it" by common
experience in the circumstances known to the actor. "The very meaning of
the fiction of implied malice in such cases at common law was, that a
man might have to answer with his life for consequences which he neither
intended nor foresaw." *Commonwealth* v. *Pierce,* 138 Massachusetts,
165, 178. *Commonwealth* v. *Chance,* 174 Massachusetts, 245, 252. "The
criterion in such cases is to examine whether common social duty would,
under the circumstances, have suggested a more circumspect conduct." 1
East P. C. 262. If a man should kill another by driving an automobile
furiously into a crowd, he might be convicted of murder however little
he expected the result. See *Reg.* v. *Desmond,* and other illustrations
in Stephen, Dig. Crim. Law, art 223, 1st ed., p. 146. If he did no more
than drive negligently through a street he might get off, with
manslaughter or less. *Reg.* v. *Swindall,* 2 C. & K. 230; *Rex* v.
*Burton,* 1 Strange, 481. And in the last case he might be held although
he himself thought that he was acting as a prudent man should\.... We
are of opinion that there is no constitutional difficulty in the way of
enforcing the criminal part of the act\....

\[Judgment reversed on other grounds.\]

\* \[Sherman Act Section 1: "Every contract, combination in the form of
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be
illegal." Section 2: "Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States,
or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony\....\"\]

with respect to Parts III, IV, and VI, in which JUSTICE SOUTER and

In 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation
Ordinance, which prohibits \"criminal street gang [ **\[ ...

members\" from \"loitering\" with one another or with other persons in
any public place. The question presented is whether the Supreme Court of
Illinois correctly held that the ordinance violates the [Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=1d3fbe49-21ad-4c7b-8b92-86714caf673c&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3WNT-PX70-004C-000X-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=gf4hk&earg=sr0&prid=4e4bf077-fd6e-4435-98d8-0d4c9c4d42a3).

Before the ordinance was adopted, the city council\'s Committee on
Police and Fire conducted hearings to explore the problems created by
the city\'s street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of
public loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the
neighborhoods where gang members are most active, as well as some of the
aldermen who represent those areas. Based on that evidence, the council
made a series of findings that are included in the text of the ordinance
and explain the reasons for its enactment.

The council found that a continuing increase in criminal street gang
activity was largely responsible for the city\'s rising murder rate, as
well as an escalation of violent and drug related crimes. It noted that
in many neighborhoods throughout the city, \"the burgeoning presence of

criminal gang members.\" Ibid.

The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to
\$ 500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and a requirement to
perform up to 120 hours of community service. Commission of the offense
involves four predicates. First, the police officer must reasonably
believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a
\"public place\" is a \"criminal street gang member.\" Second, the
persons must be \"loitering,\" which the ordinance defines as
\"remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose.\" Third, the
officer must then order \"all\" of the persons to disperse and remove
themselves \"from the area.\" Fourth, a person must disobey the
officer\'s order. If any person, whether a gang member or not, disobeys
the officer\'s order, that person is guilty of violating the ordinance.

During the three years of its enforcement, the police issued over 89,000
dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000 people for violating the
ordinance. In the ensuing enforcement proceedings, two trial judges
upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, but eleven others ruled
that it was invalid. In respondent Youkhana\'s case, the trial judge
held that the \"ordinance fails to notify individuals what conduct is
prohibited, and it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement by
police.\"

The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed. It held \"that the gang loitering
ordinance violates due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague
on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.\" [177

Furthermore, it concluded that the ordinance was \"not reasonably
susceptible to a limiting construction which would affirm its
validity.\"

We granted certiorari, 523 U.S. (1998), and now affirm. Like the
Illinois Supreme Court, we conclude that the ordinance enacted by the
city of Chicago is unconstitutionally vague.

III

The factual predicate for the city\'s ordinance is not in dispute. As
the city argues in its brief, \"the very presence of a large collection
of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on
on the public ways intimidates residents, who become afraid even to
leave their homes and go about their business. That, in turn, imperils
community residents\' sense of safety and security, detracts from
property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire neighborhoods.\"
The findings in the ordinance explain that it was motivated by these
concerns. We have no doubt that a law that directly prohibited such
intimidating conduct would be constitutional, but this ordinance broadly
covers a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertainty about
the scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for
respondents\' claim that the ordinance is too vague.

The city\'s principal response to this concern about adequate notice is
that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after they have failed
to comply with an officer\'s order to disperse. \"Whatever problem is

The broad sweep of the ordinance also violates \"\'the requirement that
a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law
enforcement.\'\" [Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at
358](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=1d3fbe49-21ad-4c7b-8b92-86714caf673c&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3WNT-PX70-004C-000X-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=gf4hk&earg=sr0&prid=4e4bf077-fd6e-4435-98d8-0d4c9c4d42a3).
There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. In any public place in
the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang
member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The
mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order
without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes. It
matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for
example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan
or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either
event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she
may \-- indeed, she \"shall\" \-- order them to disperse.

Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of
innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its language to determine if it
\"necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the
policeman on his beat.\" [Kolender v. Lawson, **\[ ...

principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this
case is the definition of loitering as \"to remain in any one place with
no apparent purpose.\"

As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it \"provides
absolute discretion to police officers to determine what activities
constitute loitering.\" **\[ ... \]**

Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance not
only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also has the
perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage much of the
intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the city
council\'s findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is
motivated either by an apparent purpose to publicize the gang\'s
dominance of certain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by
an equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in illegal
drugs. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is affirmed.

2 FN2: The ordinance states in pertinent part: "(a) Whenever a police
officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal
street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other
persons, he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove
themselves from the area. Any person who does not promptly obey such an
order is in violation of this section. " (b) It shall be an affirmative
defense to an alleged violation of this section that no person who was
observed loitering was in fact a member of a criminal street gang. "(c)

Note on Vagueness (Papachristou)

 

Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972), invalidated as
unconstitutionally vague the following Jacksonville, Florida, city
ordinance, which now seems comically vague, although similar laws were
once common in US jurisdictions:

"Rogues and vagabonds, or dissolute persons who go about begging, common
gamblers, persons who use juggling or unlawful games or plays, common
drunkards, common night walkers, thieves, pilferers or pickpockets,
traders in stolen property, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons, keepers
of gambling places, common railers and brawlers, persons wandering or
strolling around from place to place without any lawful purpose or
object, habitual loafers, disorderly persons, persons neglecting all
lawful business and habitually spending their time by frequenting houses
of ill fame, gaming houses, or places where alcoholic beverages are sold
or served, persons able to work but habitually living upon the earnings
of their wives or minor children shall be deemed vagrants and, upon
conviction in the Municipal Court shall be punished as provided for
Class D offenses."

Id. at 156-57 n.1. Among the problems with the statute, the Court noted,
are that \"\[t\]he qualification \'without any lawful purpose or
object\' may be a trap for innocent acts. Persons \'neglecting all
lawful business and habitually spending their time by frequenting
 . . .  places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served\' would
literally embrace many members of golf clubs . . . . Letting one's wife
support him is an intra-family matter, and normally of no concern to the
police.\" Id. at 164. Laws that sweep so broadly, the Court suggested,
infringe on innocent, harmless conduct; leave people to guess whether
their conduct is permissible; and require police and prosecutors both to
determine which instances are conduct are prohibited by the statute and
to pick and choose whom they will arrest and charge under the law from
among innumerable people who are arguably violating it. That discretion
may be exercised on discrimnatory grounds, as the facts of Papachristou
seemed to suggest. The defendants were two black men and two white women
who were spotted by police driving together in a car on a public street.

 

 

 

Interpreting non-vague statutes

 

With the next pair of *cases, Johnson* and *Muscarello,* we shift our
focus from the constitutional requirement that statutes not be
excessively 'vague' to our first examples of how courts interpret
criminal statutes\--that is, how courts determine the precise meaning of
constitutional, non-vague statutes. These two cases provide an
introduction to some of the challenges courts face in deciding precisely
what a law means and some the tools that courts use to resolve those
challenges. Pay attention to the interpretive rules, resources, and
techniques that courts use, e.g., statutory text, plain meaning,
purpose, legislative history, the "rule of lenity." What do the courts
say about when to use, or consider, each of these resources to determine
a statute's precise meaning as applied in a specific set of
circumstances?

 

 

 

Johnson v. State, 602 So. 2d 1288 (Fla. 1992)

 

Harding, J. \[for a unanimous court\]:

.... The issue before the court is whether section 893.13(1)(c)(1),
Florida Statutes (1989), permits the criminal prosecution of a mother,
who ingested a controlled substance prior to giving birth, for delivery
of a controlled substance to the infant during the thirty to ninety
seconds following the infant's birth, but before the umbilical cord is
severed. \[We answer the question in the negative.\]

Johnson \[argues against\] the applicability of section 893.13(1)(c)(1)
to her conviction \[arguing that\] the district court's interpretation
of the statute violates the legislature's intent; the plain language of
the statute prevents her conviction; ... and the State presented
insufficient evidence to show that she intentionally delivered cocaine
to a minor. ... The State contends that the district court correctly
found that the statute's plain language prohibits the delivery of the
controlled substance to a minor, and that the conviction does not
violate Johnson's constitutional rights.

We adopt Judge Sharp's analysis \[in dissent from the decision below,
*Johnson v. State,* 578 So. 2d 419, 420 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991)\] concerning
the insufficiency of the evidence to support Johnson's conviction and
her analysis concerning the legislature's intent in section
893.13(1)(c)(1). However, we note that Judge Sharp's analysis did not
clearly state the rules of statutory construction in the criminal
context. Although Judge Sharp correctly applied the rule of strict
construction, she failed to apply the other paramount rule of criminal
statutory construction, the rule of lenity. § 775.021(1), Fla. Stat.
(1989).

The rules of statutory construction require courts to strictly construe
criminal statutes, and that "when the language is susceptible to
differing constructions, \[the statute\] shall be construed most
favorably to the accused." § 775.021(1). In strictly construing criminal
statutes, we have held that only those terms which are "'clearly and
intelligently described in \[a penal statute's\] very words, as well as
manifestly intended by the Legislature'" are to be considered as
included in the statute. *State v. Wershow,* 343 So. 2d 605, 608 (Fla.
1977). We find that the legislative history does not show a manifest
intent to use the word "delivery" in the context of criminally
prosecuting mothers for delivery of a controlled substance to a minor by
way of the umbilical cord. This lack of legislative intent coupled with
uncertainty that the term "delivery" applies to the facts of the instant
case, compels this Court to construe the statute in favor of Johnson.
The text of Judge Sharp's dissent is as follows:

Johnson appeals from two convictions for delivering a controlled
substance to her two minor children in violation of section
893.13(1)(c)1., Florida Statutes (1989). The state's theory of the case
was that Johnson "delivered" cocaine or a derivative of the drug to her
two children *via* blood flowing through the children's umbilical cords
in the sixty-to-ninety second period after they were expelled from her
birth canal but before their cords were severed. The application of this
statute to this concept of "delivery" presents a case of first
impression in this state. Because I conclude that section 893.13(1)(c)1
was not intended to apply to these facts, I would vacate the convictions
and remand for the entry of a judgment of acquittal.

The record in this case establishes the following facts. ... In December
1988, Johnson, while pregnant with a daughter, suffered a crack
overdose. Johnson told paramedics that she had taken \$200 of crack
cocaine earlier that evening and she was concerned about the effects of
the drug on her unborn child. Johnson was then taken to the hospital for
observation.

Johnson was hospitalized again on January 23, 1989, when she was in
labor. Johnson told Dr. Tompkins, an obstetrician, that she had used
rock cocaine that morning while she was in labor. With the exception of
finding meconium stain fluid in the amniotic sack, there were no other
complications with the birth of Johnson's baby daughter. Approximately
sixty-to-ninety seconds elapsed from the time the child's head emerged
from her mother's birth canal until her umbilical cord was clamped.

The following day, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
investigated an abuse report of a cocaine baby concerning Johnson's
daughter. Johnson told the investigator that she had smoked pot and
crack cocaine three to four times every-other-day throughout the
duration of her pregnancy with her daughter. \...

At Johnson's trial, Dr. Tompkins testified that a mother's blood passes
nutrients, oxygen and chemicals to an unborn child by a diffusion
exchange at the capillary level from the womb to the placenta. The
umbilical cord then circulates the baby's blood (including the exchange
from its mother) between the placenta and the child. Metabolized cocaine
derivatives in the mother's blood thus diffuse from the womb to the
placenta, and then reach the baby through its umbilical cord. Although
the blood flow is somewhat restricted during the birthing process, a
measurable amount of blood is transferred from the placenta to the baby
through the umbilical cord during delivery and after birth.

... Dr. Stephen Kandall, a neonatologist, testified for the defense that
it was impossible to tell whether the cocaine derivatives which appeared
in these children's urine shortly after birth were the result of the
exchange from the mother to her children before or after they were born
because most of it took place from womb to the placenta before the birth
process was complete. ... Dr. Kandall admitted that it is theoretically
possible that cocaine or other substances can pass between a mother and
her baby during the thirty-to-sixty-second period after the child is
born and before the umbilical cord is cut, but that the amount would be
tiny.

I submit there was no medical testimony adequate to support the trial
court's finding that a "delivery" occurred here during the birthing
process, even if the criminal statute is applicable. ...

However, in my view, the primary question in this case is whether
section 893.13(1)(c)1. was intended by the Legislature to apply to the
birthing process. Before Johnson can be prosecuted under this statute,
it must be clear that the Legislature intended for it to apply to the
delivery of cocaine derivatives to a newborn during a sixty-to-ninety
second interval, before severance of the umbilical cord. I can find no
case where "delivery" of a drug was based on an involuntary act such as
diffusion and blood flow. Criminal statutes must be *strictly*---not
loosely---construed. § 775.021(1), Fla. Stat. (1989); *Perkins v.
State,* 576 So. 2d 1310 (Fla. 1991) ...

Further, in construing a statute, we must consider its history, the evil
to be corrected, the intention of the Legislature, the subject to be
regulated and the objects to be attained. Legislative intent is the
polestar by which the courts must be guided. *...* Legislative intent
may be express or it may be gathered from the purpose of the act, the
administrative construction of it, *other legislative acts bearing upon
the subject,* and all the circumstances surrounding and attendant upon
it. ... My review of other pertinent legislative enactments,
specifically chapter 415, leads me to conclude in this case that the
Legislature expressly chose to treat the problem of drug dependent
mothers and newborns as a public health problem and that it considered
but rejected imposing criminal sanctions, via section 893.13(1)(c)1.

In 1982, sections 415.501-514 were enacted to deal with the problem of
child abuse and neglect. The Legislature determined that because of the
impact that abuse or neglect has on a victimized child, siblings, family
structure, and inevitably on all citizens of the state, the prevention
of child abuse and neglect is a priority of this state. § 415.501, Fla.
Stat. (1989). To further this end, the Legislature required that a
comprehensive approach for the prevention of abuse and neglect of
children be developed for the state. *Id.* The statute defined an
"abused or neglected child" as a child whose physical or mental health
or welfare was harmed, or threatened with harm, by the acts of omissions
of the parent or other person responsible for the child's welfare. As
originally defined, "harm" included physical or mental injury, sexual
abuse, exploitation, abandonment, and neglect. § 415.503(7).

In 1987, a bill was proposed to broaden the definition of "harm" to
include physical dependency of a newborn infant upon certain controlled
drugs. However, there was a concern among legislators that this language
might authorize criminal prosecutions of mothers who give birth to
drug-dependent children. ... The bill was then amended to provide that
no parent of a drug-dependent newborn shall be subject to criminal
investigation solely on the basis of the infant's drug dependency. In
the words of the sponsor of the House bill:

This clearly states that the individual would not be subject to any
investigation solely upon the basis of the infant's drug dependency.

The prime purpose of this bill is to keep the families intact. It's not
for the purpose of investigation. ...

Again, there is a well-founded anxiety that we are looking to arrest
Moms. We're not looking to do that. What we are looking to do is we're
looking to intervene on behalf of many different state policies. . . .

The bill was passed by the Legislature and the changes were codified in
section 415.503(9)(a)2. Ch. 87-90 § 1, Laws of Fla.

From this legislative history, it is clear that the Legislature
*considered* and *rejected* a specific statutory provision authorizing
criminal penalties against mothers for delivering drug-affected children
who received transfer of an illegal drug derivative metabolized by the
mother's body, *in utero.* In light of this express legislative
statement, I conclude that the Legislature never intended for the
general drug delivery statute to authorize prosecutions of those mothers
who take illegal drugs close enough in time to childbirth that a doctor
could testify that a tiny amount passed from mother to child in the few
seconds before the umbilical cord was cut. Criminal prosecution of
mothers like Johnson will undermine Florida's express policy of "keeping
families intact" and could destroy the family by incarcerating the
child's mother when alternative measures could protect the child and
stabilize the family. Comment, *A Response to "Cocaine Babies",* 15 Fla.
St. U.L. Rev. at 881.

In similar \[Michigan and Ohio\] cases in which charges have been
brought against mothers after delivery of drug-affected newborns, those
charges have been dismissed. ... Neither judges nor prosecutors can make
criminal laws. This is the purview of the Legislature. If the
Legislature wanted to punish the uterine transfer of cocaine from a
mother to her fetus, it would be up to the Legislature to consider the
attending public policy and constitutional arguments and then pass its
legislation. The Legislature has not done so and the court has no power
to make such a law.

The Michigan court \[in *People v. Bremer,* No. 90-32227-FH (Mich. Cir.
Ct. Jan. 31, 1991)\], also rejected the prosecutor's argument that
charging women with delivery of controlled substances to their newborns
provides a strong deterrent against unlawful use of drugs by pregnant
women and prompts them to drug treatment. The court noted that
prosecution of these women would likely have the opposite effect. A
woman may abort her child or avoid prenatal care or treatment out of
fear of prosecution. Thus the court concluded that the state's interest
was better served by making treatment programs available to pregnant
addicts rather than driving them away from treatment by criminal
sanctions.

In *State v. Gray,* \[1990 WL 125695, No. L-89-239 (Ohio Ct. App. August
31, 1990)\], the defendant was indicted for child endangering based on
her use of cocaine during the last trimester of pregnancy. The trial
court concluded that the child endangering statute did not apply to this
situation and dismissed the charge against her. On appeal, the state of
Ohio argued that the trial court had failed to consider the time the
fetus is a child and still attached to the mother and the duty of care
created at that point. The appellate court concluded that the Ohio
General Assembly did not intend to criminalize the passage of harmful
substances from a mother to a child in the brief moments from birth to
the severance of the umbilical cord. "To construe the statute in this
manner would mean that every expectant woman who ingested a substance
with the potential of harm to her child, *e.g.,* alcohol or nicotine,
would be criminally liable under \[the child endangering statute\]. We
do not believe such result was intended by the General Assembly."

There can be no doubt that drug abuse is one of the most serious
problems confronting our society today. *National Treasury Employees
Union v. Von Raab,* 489 U.S. 656 (1989). Of particular concern is the
alarming rise in the number of babies born with cocaine in their systems
as a result of cocaine use by pregnant women. ... It is well-established
that the effects of cocaine use by a pregnant woman on her fetus and
later on her newborn can be severe. ... The basic problem of damaging
the fetus by drug use during pregnancy should not be addressed
piecemeal, however, by prosecuting users who deliver their babies close
in time to use of drugs and ignoring those who simply use drugs during
their pregnancy.

Florida could possibly have elected to make *in utero* transfers
criminal. But it chose to deal with this problem in other ways. One way
is to allow evidence of drug use by women as a ground for removal of the
child to the custody of protective services, as was done in this case.
Some states have responded to this crisis by charging women with child
abuse and neglect. \[Michigan, New York, Ohio citations omitted.\]

However, prosecuting women for using drugs and "delivering" them to
their newborns appears to be the least effective response to this
crisis. Rather than face the possibility of prosecution, pregnant women
who are substance abusers may simply avoid prenatal or medical care for
fear of being detected. Yet the newborns of these women are, as a group,
the most fragile and sick, and most in need of hospital neonatal care. A
decision to deliver these babies "at-home" will have tragic and serious
consequences. As the AMA Board of Trustees Reports notes:

\[C\]riminal penalties may exacerbate the harm done to fetal health by
deterring pregnant substance abusers from obtaining help or care from
either the health or public welfare professions, the very people who are
best able to prevent future abuse. The California Medical Association
has noted:

While unhealthy behavior cannot be condoned, to bring criminal charges
against a pregnant woman for activities which may be harmful to her
fetus is inappropriate. Such prosecution is counterproductive to the
public interest as it may discourage a woman from seeking prenatal care
or dissuade her from providing accurate information to health care
providers out of fear of self-incrimination. ...

Florida's Secretary of Health and Rehabilitative Services has also
observed that potential prosecution under existing child abuse or drug
use statutes already 'makes many potential reporters reluctant to
identify women as substance abusers.' ...

264 JAMA at 2669. *...*

In summary, I would hold that section 893.13(1)(c)1 does not encompass
"delivery" of an illegal drug derivative from womb to placenta to
umbilical cord to newborn after a child's birth. If that is the intent
of the Legislature, then this statute should be redrafted to clearly
address the basic problem of passing illegal substances from mother to
child *in utero,* not just in the birthing process.

*Johnson,* 578 So. 2d at 421-427 (Sharp, J., dissenting) (alteration in
original).

Since the Fifth District Court of Appeal's decision, several other
courts have ruled on issues similar to ones presented in this case.
\[Citations to Florida, Ohio, New York and Kentucky decisions---all
holding mothers cannot be prosecuted for child abuse or endangerment for
drug use during pregnancy---omitted.\]. At oral argument the State
acknowledged that no other jurisdiction has upheld a conviction of a
mother for delivery of a controlled substance to an infant through
either the umbilical cord or an *in utero* transmission; nor has the
State submitted any subsequent authority to reflect that this fact has
changed. The Court declines the State's invitation to walk down a path
that the law, public policy, reason and common sense forbid it to tread.
Therefore, we quash the decision below, answer the certified question in
the negative, and remand with directions that Johnson's two convictions
be reversed. It is so ordered.

Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125 (1998)

 

 Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

 A provision in the firearms chapter of the federal criminal code
imposes a 5-year mandatory prison term upon a person who \"uses or
carries a firearm\" \"during and in relation to\" a \"drug trafficking
crime.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1). The question before us is whether the
phrase \"carries a firearm\" is limited to the carrying of firearms on
the person. We hold that it is not so limited. Rather, it also applies
to a person who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle,
including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car, which the
person accompanies.

The question arises in two cases, which we have consolidated for
argument. The defendant in the first case, Frank J. Muscarello,
unlawfully sold marijuana, which he carried in his truck to the place of
sale. Police officers found a handgun locked in the truck\'s glove
compartment. During plea proceedings, Muscarello admitted that he had
\"carried\" the gun \"for protection in relation\" to the drug offense,
App. in No. 96-1654, p. 12, though he later claimed to the contrary, and
added that, in any event, his \"carrying\" of the gun in the glove
compartment did not fall within the scope of the statutory word
\"carries.\"

The defendants in the second case, Donald Cleveland and Enrique
Gray-Santana, placed several guns in a bag, put the bag in the trunk of
a car, and then traveled by car to a proposed drug-sale point, where
they intended to steal drugs from the sellers. Federal agents at the
scene stopped them, searched the cars, found the guns and drugs, and
arrested them.

In both cases the Courts of Appeals found that the defendants had
\"carried\" the guns during and in relation to a drug trafficking
offense. We granted certiorari to determine whether the fact that the
guns were found in the locked glove compartment, or the trunk, of a car,
precludes application of § 924(c)(1). We conclude that it does not.

II

A

 We begin with the statute\'s language. The parties vigorously contest
the ordinary English meaning of the phrase \"carries a firearm.\"
Because they essentially agree that Congress intended the phrase to
convey its ordinary, and not some special legal, meaning, and because
they argue the linguistic point at length, we too have looked into the
matter in more than usual depth. Although the word \"carry\" has many
different meanings, only two are relevant here. When one uses the word
in the first, or primary, meaning, one can, as a matter of ordinary
English, \"carry firearms\" in a wagon, car, truck, or other vehicle
that one accompanies. When one uses the word in a different, rather
special, way, to mean, for example, \"bearing\" or (in slang)
\"packing\" (as in \"packing a gun\"), the matter is less clear. But,
for reasons we shall set out below, we believe Congress intended to use
the word in its primary sense and not in this latter, special way.

Consider first the word\'s primary meaning. The *Oxford English
Dictionary* gives as its *first* definition \"convey, originally by cart
or wagon, hence in any vehicle, by ship, on horseback, etc.\" 2 Oxford
English Dictionary 919 (2d ed. 1989); see also Webster\'s Third New
International Dictionary 343 (1986) (*first* definition: \"move while
supporting (*as in a vehicle* or in one\'s hands or arms)\"); The Random
House Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 319 (2d ed. 1987)
(*first* definition: \"to take or support from one place to another;
convey; transport\").

The origin of the word \"carries\" explains why the first, or basic,
meaning of the word \"carry\" includes conveyance in a vehicle. See The
Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology 146 (1988) (tracing the word from Latin
\"carum,\" which means \"car\" or \"cart\"); 2 Oxford English
Dictionary, *supra*, at 919 (tracing the word from Old French \"carier\"
and the late Latin \"carricare,\" which meant to \"convey in a car\");
The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology 148 (C. Onions ed. 1966)
(same); The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, *supra*, at 143
(explaining that the term \"car\" has been used to refer to the
automobile since 1896).

The greatest of writers have used the word with this meaning. See,
*e.g.*, the King James Bible, 2 Kings 9:28 (\"His servants carried him
in a chariot to Jerusalem\"); *id.*, Isaiah 30:6 (\"They will carry
their riches upon the shoulders of young asses\"). Robinson Crusoe says,
\"with my boat, I carry\'d away every Thing.\" D. Defoe, Robinson Crusoe
174 (J. Crowley ed. 1972). And the owners of Queequeg\'s ship, Melville
writes, \"had lent him a \[wheelbarrow\], in which to carry his heavy
chest to his boarding-house.\" H. Melville, Moby Dick 43 (U. Chicago
1952). This Court, too, has spoken of the \"carrying\" of drugs in a car
or in its \"trunk.\" *California* v. *Acevedo,* 500 U.S. 565, 572-573
(1991); *Florida* v. *Jimeno,* 500 U.S. 248, 249 (1991).

These examples do not speak directly about carrying guns. But there is
nothing linguistically special about the fact that weapons, rather than
drugs, are being carried. Robinson Crusoe might have carried a gun in
his boat; Queequeg might have borrowed a wheelbarrow in which to carry,
not a chest, but a harpoon. And, to make certain that there is no
special ordinary English restriction (unmentioned in dictionaries) upon
the use of \"carry\" in respect to guns, we have surveyed modern press
usage, albeit crudely, by searching computerized newspaper databases --
both the New York Times database in Lexis/Nexis, and the \"US News\"
database in Westlaw. We looked for sentences in which the words
\"carry,\" \"vehicle,\" and \"weapon\" (or variations thereof) all
appear. We found thousands of such sentences, and random sampling
suggests that many, perhaps more than one third, are sentences used to
convey the meaning at issue here, *i.e.,* the carrying of guns in a
car....

Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word \"carry\"
-- a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the
dissent must rest. The Oxford English Dictionary\'s *twenty-sixth*
definition of \"carry\" is \"bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one
moves about; habitually to bear about with one.\" 2 Oxford English
Dictionary, *supra*, at 921. Webster\'s defines \"carry\" as \"to move
while supporting,\" not just in a vehicle, but also \"in one\'s hands or
arms.\" Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary, *supra*, at 343.
And Black\'s Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase \"carry arms or
weapons\" as

\"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a
pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and
ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with
another person.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).

These special definitions, however, do not purport to *limit* the
\"carrying of arms\" to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts
that one who bears arms on his person \"carries a weapon.\" But to say
that is not to deny that one may *also* \"carry a weapon\" tied to the
saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.

Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to
limit the word \"carries\" in the statute to any of these special
definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a
form of an important, but secondary, meaning of \"carry,\" a meaning
that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when,
for example, a column \"carries\" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford
English Dictionary, *supra*, at 919, 921. In this sense a gangster might
\"carry\" a gun (in colloquial language, he might \"pack a gun\") even
though he does not move from his chair. It is difficult to believe,
however, that Congress intended to limit the statutory word to this
definition -- imposing special punishment upon the comatose gangster
while ignoring drug lords who drive to a sale carrying an arsenal of
weapons in their van.

** **We recognize, as the dissent emphasizes, that the word \"carry\"
has other meanings as well. But those other meanings, (*e.g.*, \"carry
all he knew,\" \"carries no colours\"), see *post*, at 6, are not
relevant here. And the fact that speakers often do *not* add to the
phrase \"carry a gun\" the words \"in a car\" is of no greater relevance
here than the fact that millions of Americans did *not* see Muscarello
carry a gun in his car. The relevant linguistic facts are that the word
\"carry\" in its ordinary sense includes carrying in a car and that the
word, used in its ordinary sense, keeps the same meaning whether one
carries a gun, a suitcase, or a banana.

Given the ordinary meaning of the word \"carry,\" it is not surprising
to find that the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals have unanimously
concluded that \"carry\" is not limited to the carrying of weapons
directly on the person but can include their carriage in a car.
\[Citations omitted.\]

B

We now explore more deeply the purely legal question of whether Congress
intended to use the word \"carry\" in its ordinary sense, or whether it
intended to limit the scope of the phrase to instances in which a gun is
carried \"on the person.\" We conclude that neither the statute\'s basic
purpose nor its legislative history support circumscribing the scope of
the word \"carry\" by applying an \"on the person\" limitation.

This Court has described the statute\'s basic purpose broadly, as an
effort to combat the \"dangerous combination\" of \"drugs and guns.\"
*Smith* v. *United States,* 508 U.S. 223, 240 (1993). And the
provision\'s chief legislative sponsor has said that the provision seeks
\"to persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave
his gun at home.\" 114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (1968) (Rep. Poff) ....

From the perspective of any such purpose (persuading a criminal \"to
leave his gun at home\") what sense would it make for this statute to
penalize one who walks with a gun in a bag to the site of a drug sale,
but to ignore a similar individual who, like defendant Gray-Santana,
travels to a similar site with a similar gun in a similar bag, but
instead of walking, drives there with the gun in his car? How persuasive
is a punishment that is without effect until a drug dealer who has
brought his gun to a sale (indeed has it available for use) actually
takes it from the trunk (or unlocks the glove compartment) of his car?
It is difficult to say that, considered as a class, those who prepare,
say, to sell drugs by placing guns in their cars are less dangerous, or
less deserving of punishment, than those who carry handguns on their
person.

We have found no significant indication elsewhere in the legislative
history of any more narrowly focused relevant purpose. We have found an
instance in which a legislator referred to the statute as applicable
when an individual \"has a firearm on his person,\" *Ibid.* (Rep.
Meskill); an instance in which a legislator speaks of \"a criminal who
takes a gun in his hand,\" *id*., at 22239 (Rep. Pucinski); and a
reference in the Senate Report to a \"gun carried in a pocket.\" S. Rep
No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1983); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 21788, 21789
(1968) (references to gun \"carrying\" without more). But in these
instances no one purports to define the scope of the term \"carries\":
and the examples of guns carried on the person are not used to
illustrate the reach of the term \"carries\" but to illustrate, or to
criticize, a different aspect of the statute....

C

We are not convinced by petitioners\' remaining arguments to the
contrary. First, they say that our definition of \"carry\" makes it the
equivalent of \"transport.\" Yet, Congress elsewhere in related statutes
used the word \"transport\" deliberately to signify a different, and
broader, statutory coverage. The immediately preceding statutory
subsection, for example, imposes a different set of penalties on one
who, with an intent to commit a crime, \"ships, transports, or receives
a firearm\" in interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 924(b). Moreover, § 926A
specifically \"entitles\" a person \"not otherwise prohibited . . . from
transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm\" to \"transport a
firearm . . . from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry\"
it to \"any other place\" where he may do so. Why, petitioners ask,
would Congress have used the word \"transport,\" or used both \"carry\"
and \"transport\" in the same provision, if it had intended to
obliterate the distinction between the two?

** **The short answer is that our definition does not equate \"carry\"
and \"transport.\" \"Carry\" implies personal agency and some degree of
possession, whereas \"transport\" does not have such a limited
connotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods in bulk over
great distances....

As we interpret the statutory scheme, it makes sense. Congress has
imposed a variable penalty with no mandatory minimum sentence upon a
person who \"transports\" (or \"ships\" or \"receives\") a firearm
knowing it will be used to commit any \"offense punishable by
imprisonment for \[more than\] . . . one year,\" § 924(b), and it has
imposed a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence upon one who \"carries\" a
firearm \"during and in relation to\" a \"drug trafficking crime,\" §
924(c). The first subsection imposes a less strict sentencing regime
upon one who, say, ships firearms by mail for use in a crime elsewhere;
the latter subsection imposes a mandatory sentence upon one who, say,
brings a weapon with him (on his person or in his car) to the site of a
drug sale.

Second, petitioners point out that, in *Bailey* v. *United States,* 516
U.S. 137 (1995), we considered the related phrase \"uses . . . a
firearm\" found in the same statutory provision now before us. See 18
U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (\"uses or carries a firearm\"). We construed the
term \"use\" narrowly, limiting its application to the \"active
employment\" of a firearm. *Bailey*, 516 U.S. at 144. Petitioners argue
that it would be anomalous to construe broadly the word \"carries,\" its
statutory next-door neighbor.

In *Bailey*, however, we limited \"use\" of a firearm to \"active
employment\" in part because we assumed \"that Congress . . . intended
each term to have a particular, non-superfluous meaning.\" *Id*., at
146.A broader interpretation of \"use,\" we said, would have swallowed
up the term \"carry.\" *Ibid*. But \"carry\" as we interpret that word
does not swallow up the term \"use.\" \"Use\" retains the same
independent meaning we found for it in *Bailey*, where we provided
examples involving the displaying or the bartering of a gun. *Ibid*.
\"Carry\" also retains an independent meaning, for, under *Bailey*,
carrying a gun in a car does not necessarily involve the gun\'s \"active
employment.\" More importantly, having construed \"use\" narrowly in
*Bailey*, we cannot also construe \"carry\" narrowly without
undercutting the statute\'s basic objective. For the narrow
interpretation would remove the act of carrying a gun in a car entirely
from the statute\'s reach, leaving a gap in coverage that we do not
believe Congress intended.

 Third, petitioners say that our reading of the statute would extend its
coverage to passengers on buses, trains, or ships, who have placed a
firearm, say, in checked luggage. To extend this statute so far, they
argue, is unfair, going well beyond what Congress likely would have
thought possible. They add that some lower courts, thinking
approximately the same, have limited the scope of \"carries\" to
instances where a gun in a car is immediately accessible, thereby most
likely excluding from coverage a gun carried in a car\'s trunk or locked
glove compartment. See, *e.g*., *Foster*, 133 F.3d at 708 (concluding
that person \"carries\" a firearm in a car only if the firearm is
immediately accessible); *Giraldo*, 80 F.3d at 676 (same).

In our view, this argument does not take adequate account of other
limiting words in the statute -- words that make the statute applicable
only where a defendant \"carries\" a gun *both* \"during *and* in
relation to\" a drug crime. § 924(c)(1) (emphasis added). Congress added
these words in part to prevent prosecution where guns \"played\" no part
in the crime. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 314, n. 10; cf. *United States*
v. *Stewart*, 779 F.2d 538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (observing that
\"\'in relation to\'\" was \"added to allay explicitly the concern that
a person could be prosecuted . . . for committing an entirely unrelated
crime while in possession of a firearm\"), overruled in part on other
grounds, *United States* v. *Hernandez*, 80 F.3d 1253, 1257 (CA9 1996).

Once one takes account of the words \"during\" and \"in relation to,\"
it no longer seems beyond Congress\' likely intent, or otherwise unfair,
to interpret the statute as we have done....

 Finally, petitioners and the dissent invoke the \"rule of lenity.\" The
simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, however, is not sufficient
to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to
some degree. Cf. *Smith*, 508 U.S. at 239 (\"The mere possibility of
articulating a narrower construction . . . does not by itself make the
rule of lenity applicable\"). \"\'The rule of lenity applies only if,
\"after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,\" . . . we can
make \"no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"\' \" ...
Certainly, our decision today is based on much more than a \" guess as
to what Congress intended, \" and there is no \"grievous ambiguity\"
here. The problem of statutory interpretation in this case is indeed no
different from that in many of the criminal cases that confront us. Yet,
this Court has never held that the rule of lenity automatically permits
a defendant to win.

 In sum, the \"generally accepted contemporary meaning\" of the word
\"carry\" includes the carrying of a firearm in a vehicle. The purpose
of this statute warrants its application in such circumstances. The
limiting phrase \"during and in relation to\" should prevent misuse of
the statute to penalize those whose conduct does not create the risks of
harm at which the statute aims.

** **For these reasons, we conclude that the petitioners\' conduct falls
within the scope of the phrase \"carries a firearm.\" The decisions of
the Courts of Appeals are affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

 

Justice Ginsburg, with whom the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Section 924(c)(1) of Title 18, United States Code, is a
punishment-enhancing provision; it imposes a mandatory five-year prison
term when the defendant \"during and in relation to any crime of
violence or drug trafficking . . . uses or carries a firearm.\" In
*Bailey* v. *United States*, 516 U.S. 137 (1995), this Court held that
the term \"uses,\" in the context of § 924(c)(1), means \"active
employment\" of the firearm. In today\'s cases we confront a related
question: What does the term \"carries\" mean in the context of §
924(c)(1), the enhanced punishment prescription again at issue.

It is uncontested that § 924(c)(1) applies when the defendant bears a
firearm, *i.e.*, carries the weapon on or about his person \"for the
purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in
case of a conflict.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990)
(defining the phrase \"carry arms or weapons\"); see *ante*, at 5. The
Court holds that, in addition, \"carries a firearm,\" in the context of
§ 924(c)(1), means personally transporting, possessing, or keeping a
firearm in a vehicle, anyplace in a vehicle.

Without doubt, \"carries\" is a word of many meanings, definable to mean
or include carting about in a vehicle. But that encompassing definition
is not a ubiquitously necessary one. Nor, in my judgment, is it a proper
construction of \"carries\" as the term appears in § 924(c)(1). In line
with *Bailey* and the principle of lenity the Court has long followed, I
would confine \"carries a firearm,\" for § 924(c)(1) purposes, to the
undoubted meaning of that expression in the relevant context. I would
read the words to indicate not merely keeping arms on one\'s premises or
in one\'s vehicle, but bearing them in such manner as to be ready for
use as a weapon....

Unlike the Court, I do not think dictionaries, surveys of press reports,
or the Bible tell us, dispositively, what \"carries\" means embedded in
§ 924(c)(1). On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean,
*inter alia*, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over),
be infectious, or wear or bear on one\'s person. At issue here is not
\"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court\'s computer
search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns in a car
showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one third\" of the time.
One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some two thirds of the
time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution\'s Second
Amendment (\"keep and *bear* Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black\'s Law
Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the
person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being
armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict
with another person.\"

** **On lessons from literature, a scan of Bartlett\'s and other
quotation collections shows how highly selective the Court\'s choices
are. If \"the greatest of writers\" have used \"carry\" to mean convey
or transport in a vehicle, so have they used the hydra-headed word to
mean, *inter alia*, carry in one\'s hand, arms, head, heart, or soul,
sans vehicle. Consider, among countless examples:

\"He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom.\"
The King James Bible, Isaiah 40:11.

\"And still they gaz\'d, and still the wonder grew, That one small head
could carry all he knew.\" Goldsmith, The Deserted Village, ll. 215-216,
in The Poetical Works of Oliver Goldsmith 30 (A. Dobson ed. 1949).

\"There\'s a Legion that never was \'listed, That carries no colours or
crest.\" Kipling, The Lost Legion, st. 1, in Rudyard Kipling\'s Verse,
1885-1918, p. 222 (1920).

\"There is a homely adage which runs, \'Speak softly and carry a big
stick; you will go far.\'\" T. Roosevelt, Speech at Minnesota State
Fair, Sept. 2, 1901, in J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 575:16 (J.
Kaplan ed. 1992).

These and the Court\'s lexicological sources demonstrate vividly that
\"carry\" is a word commonly used to convey various messages. Such
references, given their variety, are not reliable indicators of what
Congress meant, in § 924(c)(1), by \"carries a firearm.\"

C

Noting the paradoxical statement, \"\'I *use* a gun to protect my house,
but I\'ve never had to *use* it,\'\" the Court in *Bailey*, 516 U.S. at
143, emphasized the importance of context -- the statutory context. Just
as \"uses\" was read to mean not simply \"possession,\" but \"active
employment,\" so \"carries,\" correspondingly, is properly read to
signal the most dangerous cases -- the gun at hand, ready for use as a
weapon. It is reasonable to comprehend Congress as having provided
mandatory minimums for the most life-jeopardizing gun-connection cases
(guns in or at the defendant\'s hand when committing an offense),
leaving other, less imminently threatening, situations for the more
flexible guidelines regime. As the Ninth Circuit suggested, it is not
apparent why possession of a gun in a drug dealer\'s moving vehicle
would be thought more dangerous than gun possession on premises where
drugs are sold: \"A drug dealer who packs heat is more likely to hurt
someone or provoke someone else to violence. A gun in a bag under a tarp
in a truck bed \[or in a bedroom closet\] poses substantially less risk.
*United States* v. *Foster*, 133 F.3d 704, 707 (CA9 1998) (en banc).

** **For indicators from Congress itself, it is appropriate to consider
word usage in other provisions of Title 18\'s chapter on \"Firearms.\"
See *Bailey*, 516 U.S. at 143, 146 (interpreting § 924(c)(1) in light of
18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g), 922(j), 922(k), 922(*o*)(1), 924(d)(1), 930(a),
930(b)). The Court, however, does not derive from the statutory complex
at issue its thesis that \"\'carry\' implies personal agency and some
degree of possession, whereas \'transport\' does not have such a limited
connotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods in bulk over
great distances.\" *Ante*, at 9. Looking to provisions Congress enacted,
one finds that the Legislature did not acknowledge or routinely adhere
to the distinction the Court advances today; instead, Congress sometimes
employed \"transports\" when, according to the Court, \"carries\" was
the right word to use.

Section 925(a)(2)(B), for example, provides that no criminal sanction
shall attend \"the transportation of \[a\] firearm or ammunition carried
out to enable a person, who lawfully received such firearm or ammunition
from the Secretary of the Army, to engage in military training or in
competitions.\" The full text of § 926A, rather than the truncated
version the Court presents, see *ante*, at 9, is also telling:

\"Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or
regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person
who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting,
shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a
firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully
possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully
possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation the
firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being
transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the
passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle: *Provided*, That in
the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver\'s
compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked
container other than the glove compartment or console.\"

In describing when and how a person may travel in a vehicle that
contains his firearm without violating the law, §§ 925(a)(2)(B) and 926A
use \"transport,\" not \"carry,\" to \"imply personal agency and some
degree of possession.\" See *ante*, at 9.

** **Reading \"carries\" in § 924(c)(1) to mean \"on or about \[one\'s\]
person\" is fully compatible with these and other \"Firearms\" statutes.
For example, under § 925(a)(2)(B), one could carry his gun to a car,
transport it to the shooting competition, and use it to shoot targets.
Under the conditions of § 926A, one could transport her gun in a car,
but under no circumstances could the gun be readily accessible while she
travels in the car. \"Courts normally try to read language in different,
but related, statutes, so as best to reconcile those statutes, in light
of their purposes and of common sense.\" *McFadden*, 13 F.3d at 467
(Breyer, C. J., dissenting). So reading the \"Firearms\" statutes, I
would not extend the word \"carries\" in § 924(c)(1) to mean transports
out of hand\'s reach in a vehicle.

** **II

Section 924(c)(1), as the foregoing discussion details, is not
decisively clear one way or another. The sharp division in the Court on
the proper reading of the measure confirms, \"at the very least, . . .
that the issue is subject to some doubt. Under these circumstances, we
adhere to the familiar rule that, \'where there is ambiguity in a
criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\'\"
*Adamo Wrecking Co.* v. *United States,* 434 U.S. 275, 284-285 (1978)
(citation omitted); see *United States* v. *Granderson,* 511 U.S. 39, 54
(1994) (\"Where text, structure, and history fail to establish that the
Government\'s position is unambiguously correct -- we apply the rule of
lenity and resolve the ambiguity in \[the defendant\'s\] favor.\").
\"Carry\" bears many meanings, as the Court and the \"Firearms\"
statutes demonstrate. The narrower \"on or about \[one\'s\] person\"
interpretation is hardly implausible nor at odds with an accepted
meaning of \"carries a firearm.\"

** **Overlooking that there will be an enhanced sentence for the
gun-possessing drug dealer in any event, see *supra*, at 2-4, the Court
asks rhetorically: \"How persuasive is a punishment that is without
effect until a drug dealer who has brought his gun to a sale (indeed has
it available for use) actually takes it from the trunk (or unlocks the
glove compartment) of his car?\" Correspondingly, the Court defines
\"carries a firearm\" to cover \"a person who knowingly possesses and
conveys firearms \[anyplace\] in a vehicle . . . which the person
accompanies.\" *Ante*, at 1. Congress, however, hardly lacks competence
to select the words \"possesses\" or \"conveys\" when that is what the
Legislature means. [^14^](#X52f43ecb27ee4302caf9f2e35f7ebc5d431ca15)
Notably in view of the Legislature\'s capacity to speak plainly, and of
overriding concern, the Court\'s inquiry pays scant attention to a core
reason for the rule of lenity: \"Because of the seriousness of criminal
penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral
condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define
criminal activity. This policy embodies \'the instinctive distaste
against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said
they should.\'\" *United States* v. *Bass,* 404 U.S. 336, 348 (1971)....

... Accordingly, I would reverse the judgments of the First and Fifth
Circuits.

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

1\. What are the methods courts used to determine the meaning of
statutory language in the preceding cases? Are they consistent? Which of
the methods used in these cases do you find most persuasive---or does it
depend on the case? On the facts?

2\. What is the proper unit of analysis for statutory interpretation,
according to the majority in *Muscarello*? What about according to the
dissent? Which do you find more persuasive---individual words or
phrases?

3\. Assume that there is a statute that criminalizes "any act which
directly injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent as to
require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer, as in the case
of acts which injuriously affect public morality, or obstruct, or
pervert public justice, or the administration of government." D is
accused of making phone calls to V where D, using language that would be
beeped on television, expresses interest in having sex with V. D and V
do not know each other, and D's comments leave V flustered and
disturbed. What arguments could D's attorney make about vagueness, and
on what grounds? Would your analysis change if the above rule were
derived from case law and not a statute? See Commonwealth v. Mochan, 177
Pa. Superior Ct. 454 (1955).

Consider Joel Johnson's explanation of the interaction between
unconstitutional vagueness and statutory ambiguity that can resolved by
interpretive tools including, occasionally, the rule of lenity. Although
courts in some states distinguish between "the rule of strict
construction" and "the rule of lenity," in general, as Johnson explains,
the former is an earlier label for the rule widely employed into the
late nineteenth century, while the latter gained in popularity in the
early twentieth century. Led by the U.S. Supreme Court, the name change
signaled a lesser role for the lenity rule in favor other interpretive
methods. See Joel Johnson, *Vagueness and Federal-State Relations*, 90
U. Ch. L. Rev. 1565, 1677-78, 1583, 1587 (2023):

... \[E\]arly American courts "routinely" applied the rule of strict
construction to penal statutes late into the nineteenth century \[citing
Amy Coney Barrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B.U. L.
Rev. 109, 129-30 & nn.91--92 (2010) (describing how "American judges
applied the principle of lenity from the start")\]....

When Justice Felix Frankfurter joined the Supreme Court in 1939, a
diminished view of strict construction came with him. Justice
Frankfurter led the charge against the rule's application to federal
statutes, but he did so in an "indirect way"---by moving it to "the end
of the interpretative process," with the result that courts would invoke
it only after trying to resolve ambiguity by looking to a statute's
"text, structure, purpose, and legislative history." As a marker of this
shift, Justice Frankfurter called the new diminished approach the rule
of "lenity." So reformulated and renamed, the rule of lenity "began to
lose its bite." As Professor Dan Kahan has observed, "\[r\]anking lenity
'last' among interpretive conventions \[has\] all but guarantee\[d\] its
irrelevance." ... If anything, the modern Court has made the rule
weaker---often restricting its application to instances in which
"grievous ambiguity" remains following the use of all other
interpretative tools....

It was no accident that the Court's reliance on narrowing constructions
of federal laws to avoid vagueness concerns roughly coincided with the
Court's transformation of the rule of strict construction into the far
weaker rule of lenity. With the rule of lenity relegated to "the end of
the interpretive process," any constitutional concerns---including
vagueness concerns---that might bear on the meaning of statutory
language necessarily preceded lenity in the hierarchy of
statutory-construction tools. As a functional matter, then, the
constitutional vagueness doctrine often seems to have filled the role
previously played by the rule of strict construction: when addressing
indefinite language, the Court could raise the red flag of
constitutional vagueness concerns and then construe the statute narrowly
in the name of avoiding those concerns.

 

 

 

Gray v. Kohl

 

United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida

568 F. Supp. 2d 1378 (2008)

K. Michael Moore, District Judge.

This cause came before the Court upon Defendant Richard D. Roth's Motion
for Summary Judgment and Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment.

UPON CONSIDERATION of the Motion, the Responses, the pertinent portions
of the record, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, the
Court enters the following Order.

BACKGROUND

This action arises from Defendants' prohibition of Plaintiff Thomas
Gray's ("Gray") distribution of Bibles on a public sidewalk within 500
feet of Key Largo School, a school safety zone pursuant to the Florida
School Safety Zone Statute. § 810.0975, Fla. Stat. Gray claims the
statute is unconstitutional for vagueness and overbreadth. The School
Safety Zone Statute states, in relevant part:

(2)(a) Each principal or designee of each public or private school in
this state shall notify the appropriate law enforcement agency to
prohibit any person from loitering in the school safety zone who does
not have legitimate business in the school safety zone or any other
authorization, or license to enter or remain in the school safety zone
or does not otherwise have invitee status in the designated safety zone.

\(b\) During the period from 1 hour prior to the start of a school
session until 1 hour after the conclusion of a school session, it is
unlawful for any person to enter the premises or trespass within a
school safety zone or to remain on such premises or within such school
safety zone when that person does not have legitimate business in the
school safety zone or any other authorization, license, or invitation to
enter or remain in the school safety zone. Any person who violates this
subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree\....

\(c\) Any person who does not have legitimate business in the school
safety zone or any other authorization, license, or invitation to enter
or remain in the school safety zone who shall willfully fail to remove
himself or herself from the school safety zone after the principal or
designee, having a reasonable belief that he or she will commit a crime
or is engaged in harassment or intimidation of students entering or
leaving school property, requests him or her to leave the school safety
zone commits a misdemeanor of the second degree Nothing in this section
shall be construed to abridge or infringe upon the right of any person
to peaceably assemble and protest.

\(d\) This section does not apply to residents or persons engaged in the
operation of a licensed commercial business within the school safety
zone.

810.0975(2), Fla. Stat. Section 810.0975(1) defines a "school safety
zone" as being "within 500 feet of any real property owned by or leased
to any public or private elementary, middle, or high school or school
board and used for elementary, middle, or high school education."

The following facts are set forth in the Complaint. Gray, a resident of
Key Largo, Florida, and member of Gideons International ("Gideons"),
feels a religious desire and obligation to share his religion with
others. Compl, ¶¶ 25-26. One way Plaintiff shares his religion is by
distributing Bibles in public. *Id.* at ¶ 27.

Key Largo has one road, U.S. 1, that spans its entire length. *Id.* at
137. Monroe County built and maintains a public bike path/sidewalk that
abuts the east side of U.S. 1 for approximately twenty miles in Key
Largo. *Id.* at ¶ 38. This public bike path/sidewalk is open and
accessible to the public and is regularly used by community members for
walking, running, biking, and other activities. *Id.* at 139. The public
bike path/sidewalk runs in front of com mercial businesses, government
buildings, personal residences, and public and private schools. *Id.* at
140.

Many activities occur within 500 feet of Key Largo School between one
hour prior to school beginning and one hour after school ends. *Id.* at
¶ 41. The public bike path/sidewalk abutting U.S. 1 and Key Largo School
is located within 500 feet of the school to both the north and south and
is routinely used by community members as they talk, walk, bike, and
jog. *Id.* at ¶¶ 42-43. Many businesses are located within 500 feet of
Key Largo School, including a pet motel, a gas station, "The Cracked
Conch" restaurant, and a plumbing business. *Id.* at ¶¶ 45-46. Also
within 500 feet of the school is a church, as well as a building where
trucks are housed. *Id.* at ¶¶ 5854. Numerous residences are also
located within 500 feet of the school. *Id.* at ¶ 47.

The Gideons' procedure for handing out Bibles from the public bike
path/sidewalk abutting school grounds is as follows: (1) approximately
two weeks prior to the distribution, a member calls the appropriate
police department to notify them of distribution; (2) ten to fifteen
minutes prior to distribution, a few Gideon members give school
administrators notice that they will be handing out Bibles after classes
are dismissed; (3) Gideon members are instructed that they must stand on
the public bike path/sidewalk during distribution and are not permitted
on school grounds; and (4) Gideon members are instructed not to force
Bibles on anyone....

[\[On\]]{.underline} January 19, 2007, Gray and other Gideons
distributed Bibles at Key Largo School. *Id.* at 169. Approximately two
weeks prior to the distribution at Key Largo School, Gray contacted
Deputy Williams to inform him of the planned distribution at Key Largo
School. *Id.* at 170. Gray contacted Deputy Williams three times to give
him notice. *Id.* at 1170-71. Deputy Williams told Gray that the planned
distribution from the public bike path/sidewalk at Key Largo School was
permissible....

Gray arrived at Key Largo School at approximately 2:00 p.m. on January
19, 2007. *Id.* at 173. Gray and another Gideon member then went to the
school administration building to inform the Principal of the planned
Bible distribution, but the Principal was not available. *Id.* at
176-78. Gray also spoke with Florida State Patrol Officer, Gretchen
Glenn, who was in the school office at this time, and Officer Glenn gave
no indication that the Bible distribution was problematic. *Id.* at ¶¶
81-82.

Gray then returned to the other Gideons on the public bike path/sidewalk
and positioned himself on the public bike path/sidewalk by the school
crosswalk. *Id.* at H83-85. Shortly after Gray took his position by the
crosswalk, the Principal came out of the school and stared at Gray for a
few minutes. *Id.* at ¶ 89. She did not approach or speak to Gray and
she did not witness Plaintiff handing out any Bibles. *Id.* At about
3:20 p.m., Deputy Williams stopped at Gray's position to see how
distribution was going. *Id.* at 188. For the duration of the time he
distributed Bibles at the school, Gray stood on the public bike
path/sidewalk and did not cross onto school grounds. *Id.* at 190.

At approximately 3:30 p.m., Gray received a call on his cell phone from
a fellow Gideon member who was distributing Bibles at the school that
day. *Id.* at ¶ 91. The caller informed Gray that he and another Gideon
member were being arrested. *Id.* at 192. Gray stopped distributing
Bibles, put them back in his truck, and walked up to the school's north
exit. *Id.* at 194. There were approximately five to six Sheriffs
Officers present. *Id.* at 195. Gray identified himself as the Gideon
member in charge and asked the officers who was in charge. They all
indicated that Officer John Perez was the arresting Officer. *Id.* at
196. Gray approached Officer Perez and asked what the charges were.
Officer Perez was highly agitated and said that Gray would know in
forty-eight hours when he received the report....

Gray immediately ceased his Bible distribution. *Id.* at ¶ 123. Gray has
not returned to distribute Bibles on public sidewalks within 500 feet of
school property due to his fear of arrest and prosecution. *Id.* at
1124. The Gideons who Officer Perez arrested were charged with violating
the School Safety Zone Statute but were never convicted....

On April 20, 2007, Gray filed the Verified Complaint in this case,
stating five (5) causes of action: (1) violation of the right to freedom
of speech under the First Amendment; (2) violation of the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) violation of the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) violation of the
right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment as
incorporated and applied through the Fourteenth
Amendment[*.*\...]{.underline}

ANALYSIS

*A. Vagueness*

Gray facially challenges § 810.0975 (the "School Safety Zone Statute")
on grounds that it is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. "Vagueness may invalidate a
criminal law for either of two independent reasons. First, it may fail
to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to
understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even
encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." *City of Chicago v.
Morales,* 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999); *see Kolender v. Lawson,* 461 U.S.
352, 357 (1983); Village of *Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,* 455 U.S. 489,
498 (1982); *Smith v. Goguen,* 415 U.S. 566, 573-74 (1974); *Grayned v.
City of Rockford,* 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972); *Papachristou v. City of
Jacksonville,* 405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972). "'In evaluating a facial
challenge to a state law, a federal court must \... consider any
limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has
proffered.'" *Kolender,* 461 U.S. at 355 (quoting *Village of Hoffman
Estates,* 455 U.S. at 494 n. 5). Criminal penalties are scrutinized more
closely for vagueness than civil penalties because the consequences of
imprecise criminal statutes are more severe. *Village of Hoffman
Estates,* 455 U.S. at 499-500. "\[A\] scienter requirement may mitigate
a law's vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to
the complainant that his conduct is proscribed." *Id.*

1.  Notice

"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due
Process Clause if it is so vague and standard-less that it leaves the
public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits." *Morales,* 527 U.S. at
56 (citing *Giaccio v. Pennsylvania,* 882 U.S. 399, 402-03 (1966)).
"\[Because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and
unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary
intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so
that he may act accordingly." *Village of Hoffman Estates,* 455 U.S. at
498. "\[A\] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act
in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess
at its meaning and differ in its application violates the first
essential of due process of law." *Connally v. General Construction
Co.,* 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). "No one may be required at peril of
life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal
statutes." *Lanzetta v. New Jersey,* 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939).

a\. Subsection (2)(b)

Subsection (2)(b) of the School Safety Zone Statute prohibits any person
from entering the school safety zone during certain hours of the day
unless they have "legitimate business" within the school safety zone.
"Legitimate business" is not defined in the statute and there is no
scienter requirement. The statute exempts residents, persons engaged in
the operation of a licensed commercial business, or persons having
another authorization, license or invitation to enter or remain in the
school safety zone. § 810.0975(2)(b), (3), Fla. Stat. Violation of this
portion of the statute contains no prerequisite that a person refuse to
leave the area once notified that they have no "legitimate business" in
the school safety zone. An individual is in violation of subsection
(2)(b) as soon as they enter the school safety zone during an applicable
time of day without "legitimate business" to justify their presence.
Because the school safety zone extends 500 feet outward from the
perimeter of school property, the school safety zone around Key Largo
School encompasses residential neighborhoods, businesses and sidewalks
on both sides of U.S. 1. Therefore, people in any of these areas who are
not exempt may be convicted of a second degree misdemeanor unless they
are in the school safety zone on "legitimate business."

By its terms, the School Safety Zone Statute passes constitutional
muster only if "legitimate business" reasonably informs individuals of
ordinary intelligence of the acts that will render them in violation of
the statute. Florida's appellate courts have never had occasion to
define, clarify or narrow the meaning of "legitimate business" within
the context of § 810.0975. However, other Florida statutes and municipal
ordinances have used the term "legitimate business" to define
permissible conduct. Former Jacksonville municipal curfew ordinance §
614.104 prohibited minors under 16 from loitering or wandering on public
streets between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and sunrise unless accompanied
by a parent or on "legitimate business." The First District Court of
Appeal of Florida found the ordinance unconstitutionally vague because
the term "legitimate business" "did not provide sufficient guidance to
parties as to what conduct was prohibited." *K.L.J. v. State of
Florida,* 581 So.2d 920, 922 (Fla. 1st DCA 1991). Additionally,
Florida's statute prohibiting trespass upon school grounds prohibits any
person not having "legitimate business on the campus" from entering or
remaining on the campus. § 810.097(1), Fla. Stat. The Third District
Court of Appeal of Florida has held that the term "legitimate business
on the campus" means "any purpose for being \[on campus\] which is
connected with the operation of the school." *A.C. v. The State of
Florida,* 538 So.2d 136, 137 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1989). Accordingly, the court
found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it
sufficiently described the type of activity that would expose a person
to criminal liability. *Id.; see also J.H. v. State of Florida,* 625
So.2d 883 (Fla. 1st DCA 1993).

Here, § 810.0975(2)(b) has no language, such as "on campus," that limits
the scope of "legitimate business." Therefore, no inference limiting the
scope of "legitimate business" to any purpose connected to the purpose
of the school is warranted. Even if such an inference could be
extrapolated from the text of the statute, to do so would increase the
sweep of the statute by criminalizing the presence of any nonexempt
person within 500 feet of school property who enters or remains in the
area with no reason connected to the purpose of the school. Given the
wide range of non-exempt persons and the various types of areas within
the school safety zone, such as sidewalks, residential houses and
streets, businesses, parking lots, etc., construing "legitimate purpose"
to mean any purpose which is connected with the operation of the school
would result in an application so broad that it would likely infringe on
First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Moreover, "\[t\]he Constitution
does not permit a legislature to 'set a net large enough to catch all
possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say
who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.'"
*Morales,* 527 U.S. at 60 (quoting *United States v. Reese,* 92 U.S.
214, 221 (1875)). Therefore, given that Florida's appellate courts have
not limited the scope of "legitimate business" for purposes of the
School Safety Zone Statute, this Court must rely solely on the text of
the statute to determine if it is unconstitutionally vague. *See
Kolender,* 461 U.S. at 355.

This Court finds that subsection (2)(b) of the School Safety Zone
Statute is unconstitutionally vague because it does not provide citizens
of ordinary intelligence with reasonable notice of the types of acts
that the statute criminalizes. The term "legitimate business" requires
citizens to guess at the conduct that falls within the statute's ambit
and to speculate concerning whether their reason for being in the school
safety zone is legitimate enough. The vagueness that dooms this statute
is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of
"legitimate business," but rather about what "legitimate business" is
covered by the statute and what is not. *Morales, 521* U.S. at 60; *see
Allen v. City of Bordentown,* 216 N.J. Super. 557, 565, 524 A.2d 478
(1987) (finding curfew statute unconstitutionally vague because the
words "legitimate business" are unduly subjective and fail to provide
fair notice of proscribed conduct). "Thus, the \[statute\] is vague, not
in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an
imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense
that no standard of conduct is specified at all. As a result, 'men of
ordinary intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.'" *Coates,*
402 U.S. at 614 (quoting *Connolly,* 269 U.S. at 391). Such
"\[u\]ncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to 'steer far wider of
the unlawful zone' \... than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas
were clearly marked." *Grayned,* 408 U.S. at 109 (quoting *Baggett v.
Bullitt,* 377 U.S. 360, 372 (1964)).

With respect to the imprecise scope of conduct proscribed by the School
Safety Zone Statute, the statute is similar to the ordinance held
unconstitutionally vague in *Coates v. City of Cincinnati,* 402 U.S. 611
(1971). In *Coates,* the Court assessed the constitutionality of a
Cincinnati ordinance making it a criminal offense for "three or more
persons to assemble \... on any of the sidewalks \... and there conduct
themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by." *Id.* The Court
held that the ordinance's prohibition against annoying behavior was
unconstitutionally vague because it provided an unascertainable standard
that failed to describe the proscribed conduct with reasonable
specificity, especially since "conduct that annoys some people does not
annoy others." *Id.* at 614. As a result, enforcement of the statute
would necessarily depend on whether or not a policeman was annoyed.
*Id.*

Here, citizens are no more likely to successfully ascertain what
constitutes "legitimate business" because the term is purely subjective.
The term "legitimate business" describes conduct at least as imprecisely
as does the word "annoying," because what constitutes an emergency to
one person, and thus "legitimate business," may be a mere trifle to
another. Similarly, what constitutes a moral imperative to one person,
and thus "legitimate business," may be an inconvenience or annoyance to
another. Although "legitimate business" is not an intrinsically
indiscernible term, and indeed may even have a generally accepted usage,
it does not describe a range of conduct with the specificity required of
a penal statute to enable a person of ordinary intelligence to avoid
having to speculate at its meaning. Therefore, the School Zone Safety
Statute is unconstitutionally vague because it fails "to provide the
kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what
conduct it prohibits." *Morales,* 527 U.S. at 56.

b\. Subsection (2)(c)

Subsection (2)(c) gives rise to a criminal penalty if a person fails to
vacate the school safety zone after being instructed to do so by a
principal or designee who reasonably believes a crime is about to be
committed or that the person is engaged in harassment or intimidation of
students. An argument could therefore be made that subsection (2)(c)
provides sufficient notice of proscribed conduct because a person will
always be adverted to the prohibited conduct by the principal or
designee and •will also have an opportunity to leave the school safety
zone before the conduct becomes a crime.

However, the vagueness of a statute that lacks clarity and precision
sufficient to provide a citizen of ordinary intelligence with notice of
the conduct it prohibits cannot be remedied by a provision that permits
a potential offender to cease the activity once they are advised that
their conduct is proscribed by the statute. *See Morales,* 527 U.S. at
58 (rejecting city's assertion that gang congregation ordinance provided
fair notice of proscribed conduct where no violation of the ordinance
occurred until a person failed to respond to an order of dispersal).
This is so for two reasons. First, because an order to leave the school
safety zone can only be given once the prohibited conduct has already
occurred, the statute fails to provide the advance notice that will
protect a citizen from being ordered to leave the school safety zone in
the first instance. *Id.* at 59. "Such an order cannot retroactively
give adequate warning of the boundary between the permissible and the
impermissible applications of the law." *Id.; see Wright v. Georgia,*
373 U.S. 284 (1963) (stating that "a generally worded statute that is
construed to pun ish conduct that cannot be constitutionally punished is
unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it fails to give adequate
warning of the boundary between the constitutionally permissible and
constitutionally impermissible applications of the statute"). Second,
the School Safety Zone Statute fails to define how long a person must
leave the covered area or whether they can return by simply subjectively
deciding that they have a reason that better approximates "legitimate
business." ...

Unlike subsection (2)(b), however, in addition to being present within a
school safety zone without "legitimate business," no offense results
under subsection (2)(c) unless a person refuses an order by a principal
or designee to leave the school safety zone. No order to vacate may
issue unless the principal or designee has "a reasonable belief that
\[the person\] will commit a crime or is engaged in harassment or
intimidation." § 810.0975(2)(e), Fla. Stat. The effect of this
additional limitation is that a person is proscribed from being in a
school safety zone without "legitimate business," but may not be asked
to leave, and therefore runs no risk of violating subsection (2)(c),
unless the principal or designee reasonably believes the person will
commit a crime or is engaged in harassment or intimidation. In other
words, although the statute proscribes entry into a school safety zone
without "legitimate business," the mere act of doing so does not
constitute criminal conduct unless accompanied by other evidence giving
rise to a reasonable belief that a person will commit a crime or is
engaged in harassment or intimidation.

Plaintiff has not argued that this additional limitation is also
unconstitutionally vague, but has instead focused primarily on the
vagueness created by the statute's dependence on the term "legitimate
business." This Court finds that subsection (2)(c)'s requirement that a
principal or designee have "a reasonable belief that \[the person\] will
commit a crime or is engaged in harassment or intimidation" prior to
issuing an order to leave the school safety zone resolves the
unconstitutional vagueness fatal to subsection (2)(b). Despite the
statute's reliance on "legitimate business," the additional limitations
are not unconstitutionally vague because the terms "reasonable belief,"
"harassment" and "intimidation" provide sufficient notice to enable
ordinary people to understand what kind of conduct subsection 2(e)
prohibits.

Of these terms, "harassment" is perhaps the least specific and most
subjective. However, unlike the terms "legitimate business" and "annoy,"
which are not defined in any of Florida's penal statutes, the term
"harassment" is defined as "engaging\] in a course of conduct directed
at a specific person that causes substantial emotional distress in such
person and serves no legitimate purpose." § 784.048(Z )(a), Fla. Stat.
Although this statutory definition of harassment makes use of the term
"legitimate purpose," its reliance on acts directed towards a specific
person resulting in substantial emotional distress is sufficiently
specific to put an ordinary person on notice of proscribed conduct. *See
U.S v. Eckhardt,* 466 F.3d 938, 943-44 (11th Cir.2006) (finding that
federal statute criminalizing harassing phone calls was not
unconstitutionally vague); *U.S. v. Bowker,* 372 F.3d 365, 381 (6th
Cir.2004), *vacated on other grounds* 543 U.S. 1182 (2005) (same).

This Court is cognizant that subsection (2)(c)'s applicability may be
unclear in some situations. However, the test for unconstitutional
vagueness is not whether the statute is unclear in some of its
applications. A statute is only unconstitutional if it is "impermissibly
vague in all of its applications." *Village of Hoffman Estates,* 455
U.S. at 497. Furthermore, any questionable application of the statute is
always subject to an as-applied challenge. Therefore, subsection (2)(c)
is not unconstitutionally vague....

2\. Arbitrary and Discriminatory Enforcement

A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it authorizes or encourages
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. *Morales,* 527 U.S. at 56;
*Kolender,* 461 U.S. at 357. A legislature enacting a penal statute must
"establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement." *Kolender,*
461 U.S. at 358 (quoting *Smith v. Goguen,* 415 U.S. 566, 574 (1974)).
"Where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines, a
criminal statute may permit 'a standardless sweep \[that\] allows
policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal
predilections.'" *Id.* (quoting *Goguen,* 415 U.S. at 575).

Subsection (2)(b) of the School Safety Zone Statute contains no standard
for law enforcement to ascertain when a person within a school safety
zone is there on "legitimate business." *See Id. "As* such, the statute
vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to
determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute and must be
permitted to go on his way in the absence of probable cause to arrest."
*Id.* Subsection (2)(b) therefore grants law enforcement with unbridled
discretion and "entrusts lawmaking 'to moment-to-moment judgment of the
policeman on his beat.'" *Goguen,* 415 U.S. at 575 (quoting *Gregory v.
City of Chicago,* 394 U.S. 111, 120 (1969)). As a result, subsection
(2)(b) of the School Safety Zone Statute "furnishes a convenient tool
for 'harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting
officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their
displeasure.'" *Papachristou,* 405 U.S. at 170 (quoting *Thornhill v.
Alabama,* 310 U.S. 88, 97-98 (1940)). Although the necessity of
providing children with safe and secure environs within and around
educational areas is an interest of great importance, "it cannot justify
legislation that would otherwise fail to meet constitutional standards
for definiteness and clarity." *Kolender,* 461 U.S. at 357. "Although
due process does not require impossible standards of clarity, this is
not a case where further precision in the statutory language is either
impossible or impractical." *Id.* Therefore, subsection (2)(b) of the
School Safety Zone Statute is unconstitutionally vague because it
authorizes and encourages arbitrary enforcement. For the reasons stated
above in Section 111(A)(1)(b) of this Order, subsection (2)(c) does not
create the same potential for arbitrary enforcement. Subsection (2)(a)
also lacks the potential for arbitrary enforcement because it contains
no enforcement mechanism independent of subsections (2)(b) and (c)....

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiffs
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART. Subsections 2(a) and
2(b) of § 810.0975, Florida Statutes, are declared unconstitutionally
vague. The State of Florida and its officers are hereby permanently
enjoined from enforcing these subsections....

Actus reus, or the act requirement, is the first part of culpability in
criminal law. (The second part, mens rea, will be covered in Chapter 4.)
Almost every crime must have an act, but defining that act can be
tricky. Sometimes something that seems like an act isn't an act; other
times, something that does not seem like an act is one. When you read
these cases, notice distinctions between voluntary and involuntary acts,
and between conduct and the results of conduct. Consider why the court
reaches the decision it does in each case, and what its decision says
about its corresponding concept of blameworthiness.

 

 

 

 

A Note on Common Law

 

The phrase "common law" refers to a body of law that is created and
reinforced by judicial decisions.

Based on context, this phrase can have two distinct meanings (see below)
and you should become familiar with both.

**As a legal system:**

The common law system uses case law precedents (as opposed to statutes)
to determine outcomes. In contrast, civil law systems (e.g. France,
Germany, and Louisiana) do not use judicial precedents in the same way;
that is, prior court decisions to not have create, and have the status
of, binding law in the same way.

**As a source of law:**

We also use the phrase "common law" to refer to the rules or laws that
existed before the statutes that displaced them were created.  Most
common law rules are largely derived from English (and colonial
American) sources. Since the nineteenth century, states mostly have
replaced the common law of crimes with statutes that criminal offenses.
In many instances, however, the criminal statute merely codified the
older common law definition of the crime. For example, at common law,
murder was defined by courts as "the killing of another human being with
malice aforethought." That definition remains in some state homicide
statutes. On the other hand, many criminal statutes deliberately change
the definition of a crime from the older, common law definition. Also,
be aware that a few states (including Virginia and Massachusetts)
continue to define a few crimes solely in the common law\--that is, the
definition of, say, \"larceny\" or \"manslaughter\" is not found in any
statute in that state but only in the state common law.

Some states' constitutions and statutes preserve common law crimes:

**Fla. Stat. Ann. § 775.01:** \"The common law of England in relation to
crimes, except so far as the same relates to the modes and degrees of
punishment, shall be of full force in this state where there is no
existing provision by statute on the subject.\" **Id. § 775.02: \"**When
there exists no such provision by statute, the court shall proceed to
punish such offense by fine or imprisonment, but the fine shall not
exceed \$500, nor the imprisonment 12 months.\"

**Miss. Code § 99-1-3: \"**Every offense not provided for by the
statutes of this state shall be indictable as heretofore at common
law.\"

**Va. Code § 1-200:** \"The common law of England, insofar as it is not
repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of
this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be
the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\"

**Va. Code § 18.2-16:** \"A common-law offense, for which punishment is
prescribed by statute, shall be punished only in the mode so
prescribed.\"

Other states explicitly abolish common law criminal offenses. See, e.g.:

**Minnesota Stat. § 609.015(1)**: \"Common law crimes abolished. Common
law crimes are abolished and no act or omission is a crime unless made
so by this chapter or by other applicable statute, but this does not
prevent the use of common law rules in the construction or
interpretation of the provisions of this chapter or other statute.
Crimes committed prior to September 1, 1963, are not affected thereby.\"

**Alaska Stat. § 11.81.220:** \"No conduct constitutes an offense unless
it is made an offense (1) by this title; (2) by a statute outside this
title; or (3) by a regulation authorized by and lawfully adopted under a
statute.\"

*Common law\'s relevance to statutes* :Even when the law is defined by
statute, the common law often is relevant. Common law rules can and do
often help us interpret and apply statutes to different fact patterns.
If there are ambiguities in a statute (and there so often are) or if the
statute is particularly old and incorporates common law terms or
phrases, courts will rely upon the common law to help determine what the
words in a statute mean.

*A final point*: "Common law" is not exactly the same as "case law,\"
although the common law is *found* in case law. In the modern era of
statutes and constitutions, many court decisions\--which contribute to
\"case law\"\--may not rely on, or say anything about, the common law.
Thus, any single case, such as *Martin v. State,* is not equivalent to,
and may not apply or restate, the "common law."

4 Div. 805

1944-01-18

**\[ ... \]**

SIMPSON, Judge.

Appellant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway, and appeals.
Officers of the law arrested him at his home and took him onto the
highway, where he allegedly committed the proscribed acts, viz.,
manifested a drunken condition by using loud and profane language.

The pertinent provisions of our statute are: "Any person who, while
intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more
persons are present, \* \* \* and manifests a drunken condition by
boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on
conviction, be fined", etc. Code 1940, Title 14, Section 120.

Under the plain terms of this statute, a voluntary appearance is
presupposed. The rule has been declared, and we think it sound, that an
accusation of drunkenness in a designated public place cannot be
established by proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated
condition, was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the
arresting officer. Thomas v. State, 33 Ga. 134, 125 S.E. 778; Reddick v.
State, 35 Ga. 256, 132 S.E. 645; Gunn v. State, 37 Ga. 333, 140 S.E.
524; 28 C.\]. S., Drunkards, 14, p. 560.

Conviction of appellant was contrary to this announced principle and, in
our view, erroneous. It appears that no legal conviction can be
sustained under the evidence, so, consonant with the prevai1ing rule,
the judgment of the trial court is reversed and one here rendered
discharging appellant. Code 1940, Title 7, Section 260; Robison v.
State, 30 Ala.App. 12, 200 So. 626; Atkins v. State, 27 Ala.App. 212,
169 So. 330.

Of consequence, our original opinion of affordance was likewise laid in
error. It is therefore withdrawn.

Reversed and rendered.

 

 

 

Notes and Questions on Martin v State

 

1\) Using Martin, decide the following scenario: Jacob lives in Canada
near the U.S.-Canadian border. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), U.S. federal
law does not allow "at any time \[those without the correct immigration
documents to be\] found in the United States." Jacob is kidnapped and
forcibly brought into the United States. Is he guilty? Is he guilty if
he was given sedatives before being kidnapped? 

2\) Punishing Thoughts? The phrase "I'm going to kill you" has become
somewhat of a colloquial expression of anger. What if, on your morning
commute, someone cuts you off and you think in your head a variation of
the above phrase. Can the law punish you for this thought? 

3\) Involuntary vs Voluntary Acts. Consider the following statements:

     a) David stretched his leg. 

     b) David's leg extended. 

While these two statements seem to describe the same situation, sentence
(b) could be an involuntary act. What if his little brother pulled
David\'s leg, or a doctor hit his kneecap, causing a reflexive
reaction? 

4\) Hypo 1: Consider Actus Reus and voluntary act issue in the context
of California Law 

CA Health & Safety Code 11550: 

-   No person

-   Shall be under the influence

-   Of any controlled substance

-   Unless under the direction of a person licensed by the state

(Any person convicted of violating this subdivision is guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be sentenced to serve a term of not less than 90
days or more than one year in a county jail.)

     a) What's the Actus Reus of this statute? 

5\) Assume someone slips a drug into your drink at a party, and you're
later arrested after testing positive for a controlled substance. Using
the rule from *Martin v. State*, what is your best defense? 

6\) Shlomie, age 17, is hanging out with a few friends. They'd had some
beer to drink, several hours before. They're sitting in Shlomie's car,
in the friend's driveway, \[*not a public place*\] playing loud music
and joking about whether Shlomie's shoes look enough like bowling shoes
that he won't need to rent shoes when the police drive up, shine a light
in the car window, and ask them what they're doing. The boys turn off
the music and nervously answer the police officer's questions. The
police ask them if they've been drinking. They say no, and then the
police say, "OK, you're free to go."  The boys interpret this as a
demand that they leave, given their fear of police. Shlomie backs out of
the driveway and onto the road, at which point, the police turn on their
lights and pull him over, ask him to get out and take a breathalyzer
test. 

     a) Assuming the same law as applicable in Martin, and assuming
Shlomie tests positive for intoxication, is he guilty under Alabama
law? 

"Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place
where one or more persons are present...and manifests a drunken
condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, ...shall, on conviction, be
fined."

     b) Make an argument for the State, using the rule regarding
voluntary act (from State v. Martin), explaining why Shlomie is guilty. 

     c) Make an argument(s) for the Defense for why Shlomie should be
found not guilty.

7\) A defendant is charged with an offense under a statute that provides
as follows: \"Any person who, while intoxicated, appears in any public
place and manifests a drunken condition by obstreperous or indecent
conduct is guilty of a misdemeanor.\" At trial, the evidence shows that
the defendant was intoxicated, and was walking home from a party through
a residential neighborhood, when police stopped him to ask what he was
doing. Aggravated at being stopped by police, the defendant answered
rudely, and the conversation escalated such that the defendant became
angry and obstreperous, whereupon police arrested him. 

Can the defendant properly be convicted of violating the statute? 

     a) No, because the defendant was not voluntarily obstreperous.

     b) No, because the statute requires proof of a voluntary appearance
in a public place.

     c) Yes, because the defendant voluntarily became intoxicated.

     d) Yes, because the defendant voluntarily behaved in an
obstreperous manner.

 

 

 

People v. Decina

 

New York Court of Appeals\
2 N.Y.2d 133 (1956)

FROESSEL, J.\
At about 3:30 p.m. on March 14, 1955, a bright, sunny day, defendant was
driving, alone in his car, in a northerly direction on Delaware Avenue
in the city of Buffalo.... \[D\]efendant\'s car swerved to the left,
across the center line in the street, so that it was completely in the
south lane, traveling 35 to 40 miles per hour. It then veered sharply to
the right, crossing Delaware Avenue and mounting the easterly curb at a
point beneath the viaduct and continued thereafter at a speed estimated
to have been about 50 or 60 miles per hour or more....\
A group of six schoolgirls were walking north on the easterly sidewalk
of Delaware Avenue ... when defendant\'s car struck them from behind.
One of the girls escaped injury by jumping against the wall of the
viaduct.... Three of the children, 6 to 12 years old, were found dead on
arrival by the medical examiner, and a fourth child, 7 years old, died
in a hospital two days later as a result of injuries sustained in the
accident.\
After striking the children, defendant\'s car ... crashed through a
brick wall of a grocery store .... To one witness he appeared dazed, to
another unconscious, lying back with his hands off the wheel. Various
people present shouted to defendant to turn off the ignition of his car,
and "within a matter of seconds the horn stopped blowing and the car did
shut off."\
Defendant was pulled out of the car by a number of bystanders and laid
down on the sidewalk. To a policeman who came on the scene shortly he
appeared "injured, dazed"; another witness said that "he looked as
though he was knocked out .... An injured customer in the store, after
receiving first aid, pressed defendant for an explanation of the
accident and he told her: "I blacked out from the bridge."\
... \[At the hospital, Decina\], who still felt a little dizzy or
blurry, said that as he was driving he noticed a jerking of his right
hand, which warned him that he might develop a convulsion, and that as
he tried to steer the car over to the curb he felt himself becoming
unconscious, and he thought he had a convulsion. He was aware that
children were in front of his car but did not know whether he had struck
them.\
Defendant then proceeded to relate to Dr. Wechter his past medical
history.... In 1946 he was treated in this same hospital for an illness
during which he had some convulsions. Several burr holes were made in
his skull and a brain abscess was drained. Following this operation
defendant had no convulsions from 1946 through 1950. In 1950 he had four
convulsions, caused by scar tissue on the brain. From 1950 to 1954 he
experienced about 10 or 20 seizures a year, in which his right hand
would jump although he remained fully conscious. In 1954, he had 4 or 5
generalized seizures with loss of consciousness, the last being in
September, 1954, a few months before the accident. Thereafter he had
more hospitalization, a spinal tap, consultation with a neurologist, and
took medication daily to help prevent seizures. On the basis of this
medical history, Dr. Wechter made a diagnosis of Jacksonian epilepsy,
and was of the opinion that defendant had a seizure at the time of the
accident....\
Defendant was indicted and charged with violating section 1053-a of the
Penal Law.... \[That statute provides: "A person who operates or drives
any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner,
whereby a human being is killed, is guilty of criminal negligence in
operation of a vehicle resulting in death." The defendant now argues
that the lower courts should have sustained his demurrer to the
indictment on the grounds that\] the indictment here does not charge a
crime. The indictment states essentially that defendant, knowing "that
he was subject to epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him
likely to lose consciousness for a considerable period of time", was
culpably negligent "in that he consciously undertook to and did operate
his Buick sedan on a public highway" (emphasis supplied) and "while so
doing" suffered such an attack which caused said automobile "to travel
at a fast and reckless rate of speed, jumping the curb and driving over
the sidewalk" causing the death of 4 persons. In our opinion, this
clearly states a violation of section 1053-a of the Penal Law. The
statute does not require that a defendant must deliberately intend to
kill a human being, for that would be murder. Nor does the statute
require that he knowingly and consciously follow the precise path that
leads to death and destruction. It is sufficient, we have said, when his
conduct manifests a "disregard of the consequences which may ensue from
the act, and indifference to the rights of others. No clearer
definition, applicable to the hundreds of varying circumstances that may
arise, can be given. Under a given state of facts, whether negligence is
culpable is a question of judgment." People v. Angelo, 246 N. Y. 451,
457.\
Assuming the truth of the indictment, as we must on a demurrer, this
defendant knew he was subject to epileptic attacks and seizures that
might strike at any time. He also knew that a moving motor vehicle
uncontrolled on a public highway is a highly dangerous instrumentality
capable of unrestrained destruction. With this knowledge, and without
anyone accompanying him, he deliberately took a chance by making a
conscious choice of a course of action, in disregard of the consequences
which he knew might follow from his conscious act, and which in this
case did ensue. How can we say as a matter of law that this did not
amount to culpable negligence within the meaning of section 1053-a?\
To hold otherwise would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself
in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if
it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and
reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or
involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution under
the statute. His awareness of a condition which he knows may produce
such consequences as here, and his disregard of the consequences,
renders him liable for culpable negligence, as the courts below have
properly held .... To have a sudden sleeping spell, an unexpected heart
or other disabling attack, without any prior knowledge or warning
thereof, is an altogether different situation ..., and there is simply
no basis for comparing such cases with the flagrant disregard manifested
here....\
Accordingly, the Appellate Division properly sustained the lower
court\'s order overruling the demurrer, as well as its denial of the
motion in arrest of judgment on the same ground.\
DESMOND, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part). ... I think the
indictment should be dismissed because it alleges no crime. Defendant\'s
demurrer should have been sustained.\
The indictment charges that defendant knowing that "he was subject to
epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to lose
consciousness" suffered "an attack and loss of consciousness which
caused the said automobile operated by the said defendant to travel at a
fast and reckless rate of speed" and to jump a curb and run onto the
sidewalk "thereby striking and causing the death" of 4 children.
Horrible as this occurrence was and whatever necessity it may show for
new licensing and driving laws, nevertheless this indictment charges no
crime known to the New York statutes. Our duty is to dismiss it.\
... The essentials of the crime are, ... first, vehicle operation in a
culpably negligent manner and, second, the resulting death of a person.
This indictment ... describe\[s\] the way in which defendant is supposed
to have offended against that statute. That descriptive matter ... shows
that defendant did not violate section 1053-a. No operation of an
automobile in a reckless manner is charged against defendant. The
excessive speed of the car and its jumping the curb were "caused," says
the indictment itself, by defendant\'s prior "attack and loss of
consciousness." Therefore, what defendant is accused of is not reckless
or culpably negligent driving, which necessarily connotes and involves
consciousness and volition. The fatal assault by this car was after and
because of defendant\'s failure of consciousness. To say that one drove
a car in a reckless manner in that his unconscious condition caused the
car to travel recklessly is to make two mutually contradictory
assertions. One cannot be "reckless" while unconscious. One cannot while
unconscious "operate" a car in a culpably negligent manner or in any
other "manner." The statute makes criminal a particular kind of knowing,
voluntary, immediate operation. It does not touch at all the involuntary
presence of an unconscious person at the wheel of an uncontrolled
vehicle. To negative the possibility of applying section 1053-a to these
alleged facts we do not even have to resort to the rule that all
criminal statutes are closely and strictly construed in favor of the
citizen and that no act or omission is criminal unless specifically and
in terms so labeled by a clearly worded statute.\
... Numerous are the diseases and other conditions of a human being
which make it possible or even likely that the afflicted person will
lose control of his automobile....  Just what is the court holding here?
\[That\] a driver whose brief blackout lets his car run amuck and kill
another has killed that other by reckless driving. But any such
"recklessness" consists necessarily not of the erratic behavior of the
automobile while its driver is unconscious, but of his driving at all
when he knew he was subject to such attacks. Thus, it must be that such
a blackout-prone driver is guilty of reckless driving (Vehicle and
Traffic Law, § 58) whenever and as soon as he steps into the driver\'s
seat of a vehicle. Every time he drives, accident or no accident, he is
subject to criminal prosecution for reckless driving or to revocation of
his operator\'s license....\
The demurrer should be sustained and the indictment dismissed.

 

 

 

Notes and Questions for People v. Decina

 

1\) Epilepsy: Voluntary or Involuntary?  How would *Decina*\'s analysis
change in the following circumstances. 

     a) If Decina had no prior seizures? 

     b) If Decina were given medication, in the form of a daily pill,
that would eliminate seizures and he forgot to take his pill on the day
of the accident? 

     c) If Decina were given a new time-release medication patch that,
in 99 of 100 people, completely eliminated seizures? 

 

2\) Model Penal Code and Decina. Using the Model Penal Code, has Decina
committed an act? Model Penal Code section 2.01 reads, in relevant part:

Section 2.01. Requirement of Voluntary Act; Omission as Basis of
Liability; Possession as an Act.

\(1\) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based
on conduct that includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an
act of which he is physically capable.

\(2\) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this
Section:

\(a\) a reflex or convulsion;

\(b\) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;

\(c\) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;

\(d\) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or
determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

 

3\) Be careful: Decina is a case about the actus reus, but it also
touches on mens rea. It is important as you move forward to note that
criminal negligence is different from ordinary (or tortious) negligence.
In torts, your definitions come from cases. In criminal law, your
definitions come from statutes. It is a mistake to make "free-standing"
negligence arguments in criminal law\--all legal arguments must be made
with reference to authority.

 

 

 

Proctor v. State, 15 Okla. Crim. 338, 176 P. 771 (Okla. Crim. App. 1918)

 

Galbraith, J.

The plaintiff in error was charged by information filed in the district
court of Oklahoma county, tried and convicted of "keeping a place, to
wit, a two-story brick building, with the intent and for the purpose of
unlawfully selling, bartering, and giving away spirituous, vinous,
fermented and malt liquors," etc.

To the information a demurrer was interposed upon the ground that the
information fails to charge a public offense under any law of the state
of Oklahoma, and that section 4 of chapter 26, Session Laws of Oklahoma
1913, on which said information is based, is unconstitutional and void.

The statute under which the charge was laid ... reads as follows:

"Sec. 4. It shall be unlawful for any person to rent to another or keep
a place with the intention of, or for the purpose of manufacturing,
selling, bartering, giving away, or otherwise furnishing, any
spirituous, vinous, fermented or malt liquors, or any imitation thereof,
or substitute therefor, or any liquors or compounds whatsoever, whether
medicated or not, which contain as much as one-half of one per centum of
alcohol, measured by volume, and which is capable of being used as a
beverage, except preparations compounded by any licensed pharmacist, the
sale of which would not subject him to the payment of the special tax
required by the laws of the United States. Any person violating any
provision of this section shall be punished by a  fine of not less than
fifty (\$50.00) dollars, nor more than two thousand (\$2,000.00)
dollars,  and by imprisonment of not less than thirty (30) days in the
county jail, nor more than five (5) years in the state penitentiary."

It is alleged upon this appeal that the demurrer to the information was
improperly overruled.

It is argued that the above statute is in excess of the power vested in
the Legislature, in this, that it makes a mere intention, unexecuted,
and not connected with any overt act, a crime, and that this is an
impossible thing in organized society under a constitutional government.
It is further argued that the ownership of property, namely, "the
keeping a place," is an entirely lawful act, and that, when this lawful
act is accompanied with an unlawful intent to violate the law at some
future and indefinite time, that cannot be declared by statute to be a
crime, so long as the unlawful intent is not connected with some overt
act, to place the unlawful intent into operation by possession of
intoxicating liquors or by actual "sale or barter"; that this statute
runs counter to the first and fundamental principles of law and is
absolutely inoperative and void.

It is admitted on behalf of the state that ownership of property, that
is, "the keeping a place, "is an innocent and lawful act, but it is
contended that this statute was enacted in the exercise of the police
power, and that, if the Legislature determined that "the keeping a
place" with the purpose and intent of selling, bartering, and giving
away of intoxicating liquors was detrimental to the good morals and
public welfare, or was essential in the enforcement of the prohibitory
law, it was within the legislative power to declare such use of property
to be criminal and an offense against the law; that the statute itself
does not run counter to the fundamental principles of the law; and that
it does not condemn the ownership or use of property, a mere "keeping of
a place," but, when property is kept or used with unlawful intent to
violate the law, it is within the condemnation of the statute and is
properly denominated a crime; that the keeping a place connected with an
intent to violate the law constitutes an overt act and may properly be
declared to be an offense against the law. The following excerpt from
the Attorney General\'s brief will render his position clear:

"Can it be said that the Legislature intended to make that punishable
which is absolutely incapable of proof? An \'unexecuted intent\' to do a
thing amounts merely to a thought, and thoughts without action cannot be
punished and were never intended to be punished. But it may be said
that, if a person shall establish a building or place without having
possession of liquor, and thereafter should say to several of his
friends that sometime in the future he intended to sell liquors in that
particular building or place, what is to prevent his punishment under
the laws?

"Here we have the keeping of the place and his voluntary statements that
he intends to use such place unlawfully in the future. Our answer is
that there must exist a present keeping and a present intent, and this
keeping and intent, coupled, constitute the overt act. The intent is a
question of fact, not of law. No intent, however felonious, unless
coupled with some overt act, is criminal."

It will be observed that here is a clear admission on the part of the
state that the information in the instant case was insufficient,
inasmuch as the unlawful intent was not connected directly with some
overt act, and therefore that the demurrer thereto was well taken. It
cannot be true that "the keeping a place," coupled with the present
intent to violate the law, constitutes an overt act. It is admitted that
"the keeping a place" is an innocent thing, and that an unexecuted
criminal intent is not punishable as a crime, therefore that no crime is
charged.

The possession or ownership of liquors is not alleged in the
information, nor is it alleged that the liquors were manufactured,
bartered, or given away in the place kept. The information does not
attempt to charge an overt act or any attempt to place the unlawful
intention into execution. As it stands, the information upon its face
charges: First, the keeping of a place, an admittedly lawful act; and,
second, the possession of an unexecuted unlawful intent to barter, sell,
or give away liquor. And it is admitted that this unlawful intent, so
long as unexecuted, amounts merely to a thought, and is not subject to
punishment. In the language of Mr. Justice Sherwood, of the Supreme
Court of Missouri:

"With a mere guilty intent unconnected with an overt act, or outward
manifestation, the law has no concern." (*Ex parte Smith,* 135 Mo. 223.)

So in the instant case the information merely charges an innocent act,
"the keeping a place," and the possession of an unlawful, unexecuted
intent, and attempts to make that a crime. There is no overt act charged
in the information in connection with the unlawful intent. It is true
the charging part of the information is in the language of the statute,
and would be sufficient if the statute defined a crime, but the statute
itself fails to define a crime, inasmuch as it attempts to make an
innocent act, namely, "the keeping of a place," accompanied with an
unlawful and unexecuted intent to violate the law, a crime. This the
Legislature had no power to do, whatever may have been its intention in
enacting the statute under consideration. To constitute a crime there
must be some omission or commission.

An intent to commit a crime is not indictable; and, although the intent
is, in general, of the very essence of a crime, some overt act is the
only sufficient evidence of the criminal intent. Kelley\'s Crim. Law &
Prac. par. 5; 4 Blackstone *Comm*. 21; *Howell v. Stewart,* 54 Mo. 400.
The essential elements necessary to  constitute a crime under the law
are enumerated in Blackstone *Comm*. book 4, p. 20, as follows:

"An involuntary act, as it has no claim to merit, so neither can it
induce any guilt; the concurrence of the will, when it has its choice
either to do or to avoid the fact in question being the only thing that
renders human action either praiseworthy or culpable. Indeed, to make a
complete crime cognizable by human laws, there must be both a will and
an act. For, though, in *foro conscientiae,* a fixed design or will to
do an unlawful act is almost as heinous as the commission of it, yet, as
no temporal tribunal can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of
the mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it
therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know. For which reason, in
all temporal jurisdictions, an overt act, or some open evidence of an
intended crime, is necessary in order to demonstrate the depravity of
the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And, as a vicious will
without a vicious act is no civil crime, so on the other hand, an
unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all. So that to
constitute a crime against human laws there must be, first, a vicious
will,  and, secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious
will."

To the same effect Mr. Bishop, in his work on Criminal Law, vol. 1,
announces the rule applicable to the question under consideration as
follows, in section 204:

"Now the state that complains in criminal causes, does not suffer from
the mere imaginings of men. To entitle her to complain, therefore, some
act must have followed the unlawful thought. This doctrine is
fundamental, and, in a general way, universal; but slight differences in
its common law applications appear in the books, and now and then a
statute is enacted departing from judicial precedent."

In section 206:

"Sec. 206. From the foregoing views results the rule established in the
legal authorities that an act and evil intent must combine to constitute
in law a crime."

And in section 207:

"Sec. 207. And generally, perhaps always, the act and intent must, to
constitute an offense, concur in point of time."

A case in point is that of *Ex parte Smith,* 135 Mo. 223, 36 S.W. 628
\[1896\], where the first and second paragraphs of the syllabus are as
follows:

"A municipal ordinance making it a crime for \'any one knowingly to
associate with persons having the reputation of being thieves, burglars,
pickpockets, pigeon droppers, bawds, prostitutes, or gamblers, or any
other person, for the purpose or with the intent to agree, conspire,
combine, or confederate to commit any offense, or to cheat or defraud
any person of any money or property,\' is unconstitutional as being an
invasion of the rights of personal liberty."

"Guilty intention, unconnected with an overt act or outward
manifestation, cannot be the subject of punishment under statute."

Mr. Justice Sherwood, in the course of the opinion in the above case,
says:

"This ordinance is now attacked on the ground of its unconstitutionality
in that it invades the right of personal liberty by assuming to forbid
that any person should knowingly associate with those who have the
reputation of being thieves, etc. And certainly it stands to reason
that, if the Legislature, either state or municipal, may forbid one to
associate with certain classes of persons of unsavory, or malodorous
reputations, by the same token it might dictate who the associates of
any one may be. But if the Legislature may dictate who our associates
may be, then what becomes of the constitutional protection to personal
liberty, which Blackstone says \'consists in the power of locomotion, of
changing situation, or moving one\'s person to whatsover place one\'s
own inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint, unless by
due course of law\'? 1 Blackstone\'s Commentaries, 134. Obviously there
is no difference in point of legal principle between a legislative or
municipal act which forbids certain associations and one which commands
certain associations. We deny the power of any legislative body in this
country to choose for our citizens whom their associates shall be.

"And as to that portion of the eighth clause which uses the words, \'for
the purpose or with the intent to agree, conspire, combine, or
confederate, first to commit any offense,\' etc., it is quite enough to
say that human laws and human agencies have not yet arrived at such a
degree of perfection as to be able, without some overt act done, to
discern and to determine by what intent or purpose the human heart is
actuated. So that, did we concede the validity of the former portion of
the eighth clause, which we do not, still it would be wholly
impracticable for human laws to punish or even to forbid improper
intentions or purposes. For with mere guilty intention, unconnected with
overt act or outward manifestation, the law has no concern. *Howell v.
Stewart,* 54 Mo. 400."

We quite agree with Justice Sherwood that:

"Human laws and human agencies have not yet arrived at such a degree of
perfection as to be able without some overt act done to discern and to
determine by what intent or purpose the human heart is actuated."

** **The purpose of the Legislature in the enactment of the statute is
not clear, since it makes the intent to do the forbidden act a felony,
and does not attempt to repeal the statute (section 3610, Rev. Laws
1910) which makes it a misdemeanor to keep a place for the sale of
intoxicating liquors, the evil presumably intended to be suppressed.
These statutes present the strange anomaly, the one denominates the
completed act, keeping a place where intoxicating liquors "are received
and kept for sale" as a misdemeanor, while the other condemns "the
keeping a place" with intent to sell, etc., as a felony and makes it
punishable as such, thus penalizing the intent to do the act as a
felony, while the act when done is penalized only as a misdemeanor. In
any view of the case this statute is condemned by the due process of law
provision of the Constitution.

We conclude that "the keeping a place" with the unlawful purpose and
intent to sell, barter, or give away intoxicating liquors cannot be
declared to be a crime, for the reason that such an act, although
connected with an unlawful intent, still lacks an essential element
necessary to constitute a crime under the law, in this, that the statute
fails to connect such unlawful intent with any overt act, as a result or
consequence, and further fails to charge the possession of the liquors,
the very means essential to the consummation of the unlawful purpose to
violate the prohibitory law, and therefore the statute under
consideration does not define a crime, and that the information in the
instant case did not charge an offense, and the demurrer thereto was
well taken, and should have been sustained.

It is therefore ordered that the judgment of conviction be vacated, and
the cause remanded, with direction to the trial court to discharge the
accused.

 

 

 

State v. Shell

 

501 S.W.3d 22 (Mo. App. 2016)

 

Jason Shell (Defendant) appeals the judgment of the Circuit Court of St.
Charles County, entered after a jury trial, convicting him of one count
of distribution of a controlled substance and one count of involuntary
manslaughter. \...

Factual Background

In January 2012, Defendant and James Eyman (Decedent) were planning to
buy heroin. In text messages, Decedent told Defendant that he had \$40
to put toward the purchase. Combined with Defendant\'s \$30, the men
were able to purchase seven doses of heroin. Defendant contacted his
heroin dealer and purchased all \$70 worth of heroin, to be paid back by
Decedent when they met up later in the evening.

After buying the heroin, Defendant went to Decedent\'s parents\' house
--- where Decedent was living at the time --- and picked up Decedent.
The men went to Defendant\'s house, where they each injected themselves
with heroin. Defendant took three doses, while Decedent took four.
Defendant drove Decedent back to his parents\' house around 11:00 p.m.
Decedent went inside, told his mother that he was tired and going to
bed, and went into his bedroom.

At around 1:00 p.m. the next day, Decedent\'s mother went to check on
him because he had not gotten up yet. She discovered Decedent was dead.
Detective William Parks went to the house and saw that Decedent had a
puncture mark on his arm that was consistent with injecting heroin with
a hypodermic needle. Decedent\'s father told Detective Parks that
Decedent had gone out with Defendant the night before. Detective Parks
seized Decedent\'s cell phone and sent it to the cyber-crime unit. The
cell phone revealed Decedent\'s texts with Defendant about their plans
the evening before.

A few days later, Detective Parks went to Defendant\'s workplace to talk
to Defendant about Decedent\'s death. \...Defendant told Detective Parks
about how the men planned to buy heroin, how he picked Decedent up and
how they went back to his house and injected heroin. Defendant

said that he noticed that Decedent was nodding out**\[ ... \]**​ and
lethargic. The men drove to a movie

theatre but decided not to see the movie. They returned to Defendant\'s
house, where Defendant offered Decedent to stay the night so that
Defendant could keep an eye on him. Defendant was concerned with
Decedent\'s physical condition because of the amount of heroin that
Decedent injected. Nonetheless, Decedent decided to return home because
he had a curfew. \.... Subsequently, Defendant was charged with
distribution of a controlled substance and first-degree involuntary
manslaughter. \...

At the conclusion of trial, the jury found Defendant guilty of
distribution of a controlled substance and first-degree involuntary
manslaughter. The court sentenced Defendant to concurrent terms of
eighteen years\' imprisonment for distribution and fifteen years\'
imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter. Defendant appeals.

Discussion

Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction
for involuntary manslaughter. \... Defendant argues that he did not have
a duty to seek medical care for Decedent. \...

Criminal liability \"is premised on a defendant\'s conduct involving
voluntary acts.\" ​State v. Voss, No. ED101396, 488 S.W.3d 97, 110, 2016
WL 145727, at \*6 (Mo.App.E.D. 2016)​ **\[ ... \]** A voluntary act can
be an omission to perform an act. ​Id.​ However, a defendant cannot be
guilty of an offense \"based solely upon an omission to perform an act
unless the law defining the offense expressly so provides, or a duty to
perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.\" ​Id.​ \...\
Therefore, we must determine whether Defendant had a duty to seek
medical care for Decedent, and if so, whether he satisfied said duty.
\...

A. Did Defendant have a duty to act?

As noted, because Missouri\'s involuntary manslaughter statute does not
explicitly consider a defendant\'s failure to act, a duty to perform the
omitted act must be otherwise imposed by law\.... There are at least
four situations that may give rise to a duty to act: (1) where a statute
imposes a duty to care for another; (2) where the defendant stands in a
certain status relationship to another; (3) where the defendant assumed
a contractual duty to care for another; and (4) where one has
voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless
person as to prevent others from rendering aid. ​Gargus,​ 462 S.W.3d at
422​ **\[ ... \]**. A defendant stands in a \"certain status
relationship\" with the victim in cases \"where some act or omission on
the part of the defendant either created or increased the risk of injury
to \[another\]\" ​Voss, Id.​ at 112​.

Here, Defendant argues that he did not have a duty to seek medical help
for Decedent because none of the situations as laid out in ​Gargus​ apply
to the facts of his case, and specifically that he did not stand in a
\"certain status relationship\" to Decedent. Defendant maintains that
even if the law did impose a duty to act, he satisfied any duty by
inviting Decedent to stay the night, and once Decedent rejected
Defendant\'s offer, Defendant had no further duty to provide help. The
State counters that Defendant did, in fact, have a duty to act because
he voluntarily assumed the care of a vulnerable person (Decedent) and
Decedent was reliant upon Defendant for medical care.

In ​Voss,​ this Court held that the defendant had a duty to act because he
\"created and/or increased the risk of injury to \[the victim\]\" by
providing the victim with heroin, suggesting how much heroin the victim
should use, helping the victim prepare the heroin for ingestion, and
\"leaving the hotel room after \[the victim\] exhibited signs of an
overdose which \[the defendant\] recognized as such.\" ​Voss, Id.​ at 112​,
2016 WL 145727 at \*8. Accordingly, the Court concluded that because the
law imposed a duty to act, a reasonable juror could have concluded that
the defendant breached said duty by failing to go back to the hotel room
or obtain medical help for the victim. Id.​ at \*8.

Here, we cannot conclude that Defendant \"created and/or increased the
risk of injury\" to Decedent. The present case is factually
distinguishable from ​Voss,​ where the defendant played a much more active
role in the victim\'s drug overdose. Unlike ​Voss,​ Defendant\'s role in
Decedent\'s heroin use was simply that of distributor. During
Defendant\'s trial, there was no evidence that Defendant suggested how
much heroin for Decedent to use or that Defendant actively helped
Decedent ingest the drugs. While we certainly do not condone
Defendant\'s delivery of heroin to Decedent, the present case does not
rise to the level of creating or increasing the risk of injury. Under
this Court\'s holding in ​Voss,​ such a special relationship requires more
than just delivery of the heroin. Therefore, we conclude that the law
did not impose a duty because Defendant did not create and/or increase
the risk of injury to Decedent.

Regardless, we next consider the State\'s argument that the law imposed
a duty because Defendant voluntarily assumed the care of a vulnerable
person who was reliant upon him for medical care. This Court\'s
reasoning in ​State v. Gargus,​ 462 S.W.3d 417 (Mo.App.E.D. 2013),​ is
instructive. In that case, the defendant was convicted of elder abuse
following the death of her diabetic, bedbound, eighty-one-year-old
mother (the victim). ​Id.​ at 418. On appeal, the defendant argued that
the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support her
conviction because she did not have a duty to act to protect the victim.
​Id.​ at 421. The Court concluded that the defendant voluntarily assumed
care of and secluded the victim. ​Id.​ at 422. However, the Court stated
that Missouri law \"suggests a duty to act arises, whether or not the
defendant has secluded the victim, when the defendant voluntarily
assumes the care of a vulnerable person who is dependent upon the
defendant for basic necessities, such as food, clothing, shelter, and
medical care.\" ​Id.​ at 423. The Court concluded that, even if the
defendant had not secluded the victim, the defendant had a duty to act
because the defendant \"voluntarily assumed the care of \[the victim\],
knowing \[the victim\] was entirely dependent on \[the defendant\] for
her care,\" and as a result, the defendant had a duty to act reasonably
in providing that care. ​Id.​ at 424. As a result, the Court found there
to be sufficient evidence to support criminal liability for the
defendant\'s omissions. Id.

Here, it is clear that Defendant did not seclude Decedent. In fact, the
evidence shows that Defendant did the opposite --- he returned Decedent
to his parents\' house, where Decedent interacted with his mother.
Nonetheless, under ​Gargus,​ Defendant may have had a duty to act if he
voluntarily assumed the care of Decedent and Decedent was dependent upon
Defendant for medical care. In ​Gargus,​ the victim was diabetic, unable
to walk, confined to a bed. These particular facts, combined with the
\"egregious\" circumstances giving rise to criminal liability, differ
from the present case. Here, we cannot conclude that Defendant
voluntarily assumed the care of Decedent and that Decedent was entirety
dependent upon Defendant for his medical care. While Defendant and
Decedent engaged in drug use together, various other facts established
at trial support our conclusion. After Defendant dropped Decedent back
at his parents\' house,

Decedent had a conversation with his mother. Decedent may have started a
load of laundry, and then he told his mother that he was tired, said
goodnight, and told her that he loved her. These facts, when considered
in the context of Decedent\'s entire evening, show that Decedent was not
entirely dependent upon Defendant. Furthermore, Defendant was not the
only person with whom Decedent had interactions after ingesting the
drugs. Accordingly, we conclude that the law did not impose a duty to
act because Defendant did not seclude Decedent, and Decedent was not
dependent upon Defendant for medical care.

Conclusion

Given the foregoing, we affirm Defendant\'s conviction of Count I,
distribution of a controlled substance. We reverse and vacate
Defendant\'s conviction of Count II, involuntary manslaughter.

Notes and Questions on State v. Shell

 

1\) *Fraternity Hazing Gone Wrong*

Fraternity hazing is a common issue among universities across the
country. 

During a night of hazing, *A* is forced by *B* and other fraternity
members to do push-ups for hours while drinking large amounts of
alcohol. *A* begins to have a seizure. Rather than call an ambulance,
*B* states this happens to pledges all the time. *C* does not actively
participate, but does not call for help. *A* is left alone and
eventually dies. Under Shell, has B acted to cause A\'s death? Has C
acted?

Listen
[here](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5012154) to
the real incident this note is modeled on. 

2\) *Over Charging Defendants*

Twenty states allow prosecutors to bring charges for manslaughter in the
event of drug overdoses. It is argued that allowing prosecutors to bring
these charges deters individuals from distributing or selling drugs. Can
you foresee any counterproductive results of these laws? Does that
depend on how we define public safety?

Consider the Defendant in State v. Shell: Why couldn\'t the prosecutor
go after the actual narcotics dealer Defendant purchased drugs from?
What was Defendant\'s relation to Decedent? Does this seem like the sort
of defendant the charging laws are meant to target?

[Visit this  story to learn more about over
charging.](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/17/533327584/the-controversy-over-charging-drug-dealers-with-murder-after-overdoses)
\" 

3\) Write out the "rule" arising from *State v. Shell* about when a
failure to act will satisfy the "actus reus" requirement. Think about
writing something that could be used by someone *in a future case* with
different facts (a judge, a lawyer advising her client, or you on a
test). Be prepared to share your rule with classmates (have it typed out
and ready to share).

4\) A defendant is charged with criminal battery (unlawful physical
conduct). The state\'s evidence shows that the victim was struck in the
face by the defendant\'s fist. In which of the following situations is
the defendant most likely to be not guilty of the crime? 

     a) The defendant had ingested a hallucinogenic drug two hours
earlier, and thought the victim was a vampire. 

     b) The defendant was suffering from a spontaneous seizure and had
no control over his motions. 

     c) The defendant was shadow boxing without realizing that the
victim was near him. 

     d) The defendant, who had just awakened from a deep sleep, was not
fully aware of what was happening and mistakenly thought the victim was
attacking him. 

5) A defendant is charged with an offense under a statute that provides
as follows: \"Any person who, while intoxicated, appears in any public
place and manifests a drunken condition by obstreperous or indecent
conduct is guilty of a misdemeanor.\" At trial, the evidence shows that
the defendant was intoxicated, and was walking home from a party through
a residential neighborhood, when police stopped him to ask what he was
doing. Aggravated at being stopped by police, the defendant answered
rudely, and the conversation escalated such that the defendant became
angry and obstreperous, whereupon police arrested him.

Can the defendant properly be convicted of violating the statute?

1.  No, because the defendant was not voluntarily obstreperous.

2.  No, because the statute requires proof of a voluntary appearance in
    a public place.

3.  Yes, because the defendant voluntarily became intoxicated.

4.  Yes, because the defendant voluntarily behaved in an obstreperous
    manner.

6\) D owned and operated a restaurant that, for the past year, had
suffered severe losses. D was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy. One
evening as she was leaving after closing, D noticed smoke coming from
the rear of the restaurant. D realized that she had accidentally left
the oven on, causing a fire in the kitchen, which spread throughout the
restaurant. D reached for her phone to call 911 when she remembered that
her business was insured for \$100,000 and that the proceeds would pay
off all of her debts. D decided not to call. The restaurant was
completely destroyed by the fire and D collected the insurance proceeds.
D is charged with arson: "the willful or malicious setting a fire of

Commonwealth v. Carter, 481 Mass. 352 (2019)

 

KAFKER, J.

 At age seventeen, Michelle Carter was charged with involuntary
manslaughter as a youthful offender for the suicide death of Conrad Roy,
age eighteen. In Commonwealth v. Carter, 474 Mass. 624 (2016) (*Carter
I*), we affirmed the Juvenile Court judge's denial of the motion to
dismiss the youthful offender indictment, "conclud\[ing\] that there was
probable cause to show that the coercive quality of the defendant's
verbal conduct overwhelmed whatever willpower the eighteen year old
victim had to cope with his depression, and that but for the defendant's
admonishments, pressure, and instructions, the victim would not have
gotten back into \[his\] truck and poisoned himself to death." Id. at
635-36. Thereafter, the defendant waived her right to a jury trial, and
the case was tried to a judge in the Juvenile Court over several days.
The defendant was convicted as charged and has appealed. We now consider
whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the judge's
finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed
involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender, and whether the other
legal issues raised or revisited by the defense, including that the
defendant's verbal conduct was protected by the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution, require reversal of the conviction. We
conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the judge's finding
of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed
involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender, and that the other
legal issues presented by the defendant, including her First Amendment
claim, lack merit. We therefore affirm.

*Facts*

In *Carter I*, 474 Mass. at 625-630 & nn.3-8, we discussed at length the
facts before the grand jury, including the numerous text messages
exchanged between the defendant and the victim in the days leading up
the victim's death on July 12, 2014. Viewed in the light most favorable
to the Commonwealth, Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. 671, 676-677,
393 N.E.2d 370 (1979), the evidence supporting the defendant's
conviction was not substantially different at trial and revealed the
following facts.

On July 13, 2014, the victim's body was found in his truck, which was
parked in a store parking lot in Fairhaven. He had committed suicide by
inhaling carbon monoxide that was produced by a gasoline powered water
pump located in the truck.

The defendant, who lived in Plainville, and the victim, who divided his
time between his mother's home in Fairhaven and his father's home in
Mattapoisett, first met in 2012, when they were both visiting relatives
in Florida. Thereafter, they rarely saw each other in person, but they
maintained a long-distance relationship by electronic text messaging2
and cellular telephone (cell phone) conversations. A frequent subject of
their communications was the victim's fragile mental health, including
his suicidal thoughts. Between October 2012 and July 2014, the victim
attempted suicide several times by various means, including overdosing
on over-the-counter medication, drowning, water poisoning, and
suffocation. None of these attempts succeeded, as the victim abandoned
each attempt or sought rescue.

At first, the defendant urged the victim to seek professional help for
his mental illness. Indeed, in early June 2014, the defendant, who was
planning to go to McLean Hospital for treatment of an eating disorder,
asked the victim to join her, saying that the professionals there could
help him with his depression and that they could mutually support each
other. The victim rebuffed these efforts, and the tenor of their
communications changed. As the victim continued researching suicide
methods and sharing his findings with the defendant, the defendant
helped plan how, where, and when he would do so, and downplayed his
fears about how his suicide would affect his family. She also repeatedly
chastised him for his indecision and delay, texting, for example, that
he "better not be bull shiting me and saying you're gonna do this and
then purposely get caught" and made him "promise" to kill himself. The
trial judge found that the defendant's actions from June 30 to July 12
constituted wanton or reckless conduct in serious disregard of the
victim's well-being, but that this behavior did not cause his death.
This and other evidence, however, informed and instructed the judge
about the nature of their relationship and the defendant's understanding
of "the feelings that he has exchanged with her---his ambiguities, his
fears, his concerns," on the next night.

In the days leading to July 12, 2014, the victim continued planning his
suicide, including by securing a water pump that he would use to
generate carbon monoxide in his closed truck. On July 12, the victim
drove his truck to a local store's parking lot and started the pump.
While the pump was operating, filling the truck with carbon monoxide,
the defendant and victim were in contact by cell phone. Cell phone
records showed that one call of over forty minutes had been placed by
the victim to the defendant, and a second call of similar length by the
defendant to the victim, during the time when police believe the victim
was in his truck committing suicide. There is no contemporaneous record
of what the defendant and victim said to each other during those calls.

The defendant, however, sent a text to a friend at 8:02 P.M., shortly
after the second call: "he just called me and there was a loud noise
like a motor and I heard moaning like someone was in pain, and he
wouldn't answer when I said his name. I stayed on the phone for like 20
minutes and that's all I heard." And at 8:25 P.M., she again texted that
friend: "I think he just killed himself." She sent a similar text to
another friend at 9:24 P.M.: "He called me, and I heard like muffled
sounds and some type of motor running, and it was like that for 20
minutes, and he wouldn't answer. I think he killed himself." Weeks
later, on September 15, 2014, she texted the first friend again, saying
in part:

"I failed \[the victim\] I wasn't supposed to let that happen and now
I'm realizing I failed him. \[H\]is death is my fault like honestly I
could have stopped him I was on the phone with him and he got out of the
car because it was working and he got scared and I fucking told him to
get back in \... because I knew he would do it all over again the next
day and I couldn't have him live the way he was living anymore I
couldn't do it I wouldn't let him."

The judge found that the victim got out of the truck, seeking fresh air,
in a way similar to how he had abandoned his prior suicide attempts. The
judge also focused his verdict, as we predicted in *Carter I*, supra at
634, on "those final moments, when the victim had gotten out of his
truck, expressing doubts about killing himself." The judge found that
when the defendant realized he had gotten out of the truck, she
instructed him to get back in, knowing that it had become a toxic
environment and knowing the victim's fears, doubts, and fragile mental
state. The victim followed that instruction. Thereafter, the defendant,
knowing the victim was inside the truck and that the water pump was
operating---the judge noted that she could hear the sound of the pump
and the victim's coughing---took no steps to save him. She did not call
emergency personnel, contact the victim's family, or instruct him to get
out of the truck. \[The defendant eventually texted the victim's sister,
but not until 10:18 P.M., more than two hours after the second lengthy
phone call with the victim. In that text, the defendant asked, "Do you
know where your brother is?", and did not explain what she knew about
the victim.\] The victim remained in the truck and succumbed to the
carbon monoxide. The judge concluded that the defendant's actions and
her failure to act constituted, "each and all," wanton and reckless
conduct that caused the victim's death.

*Discussion*

 In *Carter I*, we considered whether there was probable cause for the
grand jury to indict the defendant as a youthful offender for
involuntary manslaughter, whereas here, we consider whether the evidence
at trial was sufficient to support her conviction of that offense beyond
a reasonable doubt, a much higher standard for the Commonwealth to meet.
In *Carter I*, however, we also addressed and resolved several legal
principles that govern this case. We rejected the defendant's claim that
her words to the victim, without any physical act on her part and even
without her physical presence at the scene, could not constitute wanton
or reckless conduct sufficient to support a charge of manslaughter.
*Carter I*, 474 Mass. at 632-633. Rather, we determined that verbal
conduct in appropriate circumstances could "overcome a person's
willpower to live, and therefore \... be the cause of a suicide." Id. at
633. We also ruled that "there was ample evidence to establish probable
cause that the defendant's conduct was wanton or reckless under either a
subjective or objective standard." Id. at 635. See id. at 631, quoting
Commonwealth v. Pugh, 462 Mass. 482, 496-497 (2012) (wanton or reckless
conduct may be "determined based either on the defendant's specific
knowledge or on what a reasonable person should have known in the
circumstances"). As we explained, "an ordinary person under the
circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger posed by
telling the victim, who was mentally fragile, predisposed to suicidal
inclinations, and in the process of killing himself, to get back in a
truck filling with carbon monoxide." *Carter I*, supra at 635. We
further explained that "the defendant---the victim's girl friend, with
whom he was in constant and perpetual contact---on a subjective basis
knew that she had some control over his actions." Id. **\[ ... \]**For
the most part, we decline to revisit these legal issues today, as we
discern no error in our earlier analysis. With these principles in mind,
we turn to the defendant's arguments on appeal, providing further
explication, particularly on the First Amendment claim, where we deem
necessary or appropriate.

*a. Sufficiency of the evidence*. The defendant argues that her
conviction was unsupported by sufficient evidence. In particular, she
argues that, to the extent her conviction was based on the victim\'s
getting out of the truck and her ordering him back into it, it was
improperly based on her after-the-fact statement, in her text message to
a friend, that the victim \"got out of the \[truck\] because it was
working and he got scared and I fucking told him to get back in,\" a
statement she asserts is uncorroborated....

Here, the defendant\'s statement was more than adequately corroborated
not only by the victim\'s death but also by text messages exchanged with
the victim encouraging him to commit suicide, and by the fact that the
defendant and the victim were in voice contact while the suicide was in
progress --- that is, despite the physical distance between them, the
defendant was able to communicate with the victim, hear what was going
on in the truck, and give him instructions.... The judge emphasized that
the \"photos taken at the scene of the crime, where \[the victim\'s\]
truck was located, clearly illustrate the location of the water pump
immediately adjacent to where he would have been sitting in the truck,
next to his upper torso and his head, thereby giving a good explanation
to \[the defendant\'s description\] that the noise was loud within the
truck. \[The defendant\] at that point, therefore, had reason to know
that \[the victim\] had followed her instruction and had placed himself
in the toxic environment of that truck.\" ...

\[Moreover, the trial judge's findings\] expressly tracked the elements
of manslaughter. He found: "She instructs \[the victim\] to get back
into the truck, well knowing of all of the feelings that he has
exchanged with her---his ambiguities, his fears, his concerns." This,
the judge found, constituted "wanton and reckless conduct by \[the
defendant\], creating a situation where there is a high degree of
likelihood that substantial harm would result to \[the
victim\]."[9](#X80e1abf14d141514600e484a139fd83994aba27)

*Conclusion*

The evidence against the defendant proved that, by her wanton or
reckless conduct, she caused the victim's death by suicide. Her
conviction of involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender is not
legally or constitutionally infirm. The judgment is therefore affirmed.

***Optional reading**: below are some of Carter's text exchanges with
Roy, which appear in footnotes to the full **Carter** opinion, and also
in the **Carter I** decision*:

For example, on July 7, 2014, between 10:57 p.m. and 11:08 p.m., they
exchanged the following text messages:

Defendant: \"Well there\'s more ways to make CO. Google ways to make
it\....\"

Victim: \"Omg\"

Defendant: \"What\"

Victim: \"portable generator that\'s it\"

Defendant: \"That makes CO?\"

Victim: \"yeah! It\'s an internal combustion engine.\"

Defendant: \"Do you have one of those?\"

Victim: \"There\'s one at work.\"

Similarly, on July 11, 2014, at 5:13 p.m., the defendant sent the victim
the following text message: \"\... Well in my opinion, I think u should
do the generator because I don\'t know much about the pump and with a
generator u can\'t fail\"

---

During the evening of July 11 and morning of July 12, 2014, the victim
and the defendant exchanged the following text messages:

Victim: \"I have a bad feeling tht this is going to create a lot of
depression between my parents/sisters\" \...

Defendant: \"I think your parents know you\'re in a really bad place. Im
not saying they want you to do it, but I honestly feel like they can
except it. They know there\'s nothing they can do, they\'ve tried
helping, everyone\'s tried. But there\'s a point that comes where there
isn\'t anything anyone can do to save you, not even yourself, and
you\'ve hit that point and I think your parents know you\'ve hit that
point. You said you\'re mom saw a suicide thing on your computer and she
didn\'t say anything. I think she knows it\'s on your mind, and she\'s
prepared for it\"

Defendant: \"Everyone will be sad for a while, but they will get over it
and move on. They won\'t be in depression I won\'t let that happen. They
know how sad you are and they know that you\'re doing this to be happy,
and I think they will understand and accept it. They\'ll always carry u
in their hearts\" \...

Victim: \"i don\'t want anyone hurt in the process though\"

Victim: \"I meant when they open the door, all the carbon monoxide is
gonna come out they can\'t see it or smell it. whoever opens the door\"

Defendant: \"They will see the generator and know that you died of
CO\....\" \...

Victim: \"Idk I\'m freaking out again\" \...

Defendant: \"I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and
you\'re ready, you just need to do it! You can\'t keep living this way.
You just need to do it like you did last time and not think about it and
just do it babe. You can\'t keep doing this every day\"

Victim: \"I do want to. but like I\'m freaking for my family. I guess\"

Victim: \"idkkk\"

Defendant: \"Conrad. I told you I\'ll take care of them. Everyone will
take care of them to make sure they won\'t be alone and people will help
them get thru it. We talked about this, they will be okay and accept it.
People who commit suicide don\'t think this much and they just do it\"

On July 12, 2014, between 4:25 a.m. and 4:34 a.m., they exchanged the
following text messages:

Defendant: \"So I guess you aren\'t gonna do it then, all that for
nothing\"

Defendant: \"I\'m just confused like you were so ready and determined\"

Victim: \"I am gonna eventually\"

Victim: \"I really don\'t know what I\'m waiting for .. but I have
everything lined up\"

Defendant: \"No, you\'re not, Conrad. Last night was it. You keep
pushing it off and you say you\'ll do it but u never do. Its always
gonna be that way if u don\'t take action\"

Defendant: \"You\'re just making it harder on yourself by pushing it
off, you just have to do it\"

Defendant: \"Do u wanna do it now?\"

Victim: \"Is it too late?\"

Victim: \"Idkk it\'s already light outside\"

Victim: \"I\'m gonna go back to sleep, love you I\'ll text you
tomorrow\"

Defendant: \"No? Its probably the best time now because everyone\'s
sleeping. Just go somewhere in your truck. And no one\'s really out
right now because it\'s an awkward time\"

Defendant: \"If u don\'t do it now you\'re never gonna do it\"

Defendant: \"And u can say you\'ll do it tomorrow but you probably
won\'t\"

At various times between July 4 and July 12, 2014, the defendant and the
victim exchanged several similar text messages:

Defendant: \"You\'re gonna have to prove me wrong because I just don\'t
think you really want this. You just keeps pushing it off to another
night and say you\'ll do it but you never do\"\...

Defendant: \"SEE THAT\'S WHAT I MEAN. YOU KEEP PUSHING IT OFF! You just
said you were gonna do it tonight and now you\'re saying
eventually\....\" \...

Defendant: \"But I bet you\'re gonna be like \'oh, it didn\'t work
because I didn\'t tape the tube right or something like that\' \... I
bet you\'re gonna say an excuse like that\" \...

Defendant: \"Do you have the generator?\"

Victim: \"not yet lol\"

Defendant: \"WELL WHEN ARE YOU GETTING IT\" \...

Defendant: \"You better not be bull shiting me and saying you\'re gonna
do this and then purposely get caught\" \...

Defendant: \"You just need to do it Conrad or I\'m gonna get you help\"

Defendant: \"You can\'t keep doing this everyday\"

Victim: \"Okay I\'m gonna do it today\"

Defendant: \"Do you promise\"

Victim: \"I promise babe\"

Victim: \"I have to now\"

Defendant: \"Like right now?\"

Victim: \"where do I go?:(\"

Defendant: \"And u can\'t break a promise. And *just go in a quiet
parking lot or something*\" (emphasis added).

[**\[ ... \]**](#X4d2f4feec8f63e767cf2a637af3565324119995)

[9](#X499bf450138bf2e0654aed0d36c6db5b77e0cbc) There is no question in
this case that the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
the defendant engaged in wanton or reckless conduct, that is,
"intentional conduct \... involv\[ing\] a high degree of likelihood that
substantial harm will result to another." *Pugh*, 462 Mass. at 496. Both
the objective and subjective standards discussed above are satisfied.
Given the victim's mental illness, his previous suicide attempts, and
his suicide plans, there can be no doubt that an ordinary person such as
the defendant, his girlfriend who constantly communicated with him,
would understand the grave danger to his life, and yet she continued to
pressure him to follow through with his plan. The difficult issue before
us is not whether the defendant's conduct was wanton or reckless, as
this is not a close question, but whether her conduct was the cause of
the victim's death.

Mens Rea: Required mental states

 

The \"Guilty Mind\" Element

 

*Mens rea\--*Latin for \'guilty mind\'\--is the traditional common law
term for the state of mind that must accompany conduct in order for one
to be guilty of a crime. The materials in this section introduce you to
the concept of mens rea. Like actus reus, mens rea weaves together ideas
about the offender\'s blameworthiness, the seriousness of the crime, and
the punishment that should be imposed. Mental state is critical to
determining culpability. It is universal intuition that there is a moral
difference between doing something knowingly v. unknowingly,
intentionally v. unintentionally, or intentionally-but-carefully v.
intentionally-but-negligently or recklessly. Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes expressed this notion in a now-famous aphorism: "Even a dog knows
the difference between being kicked and being stumbled over."

Courts and legislatures in the U.S. (and those in the United Kingdom and
other common law countries) continue to use a wide variety of
traditional terms developed in the common law to describe required *mens
rea* or mental states for crimes, such as: scienter, intent, purpose,
knowledge, malice/maliciously, corrupt/corruptly, and more. But two
terms are especially widely used and important\--\"general intent\" and
\"specific intent.\" \"At common law, crimes generally were classified
as requiring either \'general intent\' or \'specific intent.\'\" United
States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 403 (1980). Don\'t expect clear,
consistent definitions of these terms that are easy to understand and
apply. \"This venerable distinction \... has been the source of a good
deal of confusion.\" Id. This confusion arises in part because courts
have been unable to consistently define general and specific intent,
which has led some courts discourage trial judges, when instructing
juries on mens rea requirements, to "eschew use of difficult legal
concepts like \'specific intent\' and \'general intent.\'\" Liparota v.
United States, 471 U.S. 419, 433 n.16 (1985). In part because "the
mental element in criminal law encompasses more than the two
possibilities of \'specific\' and \'general\' intent.\" *Liparota*, at
423 n.5. And in part difficulties arise because legislatures do not
employ these terms consistently in criminal codes, or draft criminal
statutes carefully with these terms in mind.

Additionally, as we will later see, there are also strict liability
offenses: crimes for which the defendant\'s state of mind is irrelevant.
These typically involve acts/harms determined to be particularly
injurious to public health and must be deterred/punished regardless of
intent. To be convicted under a strict liability statute, the defendant
must only have committed a voluntary act (actus reus) that caused the
harmful result (causation) the statute was designed to prevent. Some
examples of strict liability offenses are traffic violations, statutory
rape, and felony murder. (Note that for all these offenses, the actor is
knowingly doing *something*\--driving, having sex, committing a
non-homicide felony. But no knowledge, intent, or unreasonableness is
required as to the resulting strict liability crime.)

The following cases provide an introduction to some of the challenges of
defining precisely what those terms mean, or require, in particular
criminal statutes. As you read these cases, consider what reasoning
courts use to justify their decisions and what these reasons reveal
about the evolving concept of blameworthiness. Always pay close
attention to how the \"guilty\" state of mind is framed by the relevant
statute(s) and the relationships between various mens rea and the
severity of punishment.

We then turn to a modern reform effort to replace these common law terms
with different, perhaps-more-precise culpability terms\--those proposed
by the American Law Institute\'s Model Penal Code, which have been
adopted in a fair number (roughly half) of state criminal codes and
somewhat influential even in jurisdictions that have not formally
enacted them. As we will see, the MPC categorizes culpable mental states
into four tiers of culpability: [purposely]{.underline} (acting with a
conscious objective to produce the offense specified in the statute);
[knowingly]{.underline} (acting while being practically certain of the
offending result); [recklessly]{.underline} (acting with a conscious
disregard for the risk of causing the offending result); and
[negligently]{.underline} (causing the offending result when the actor
should have been aware of the risk). See MPC s 2.02(3).

While many statutes will seem loosely based on the four-tiered MPC
framework, you should not assume they are identical. Courts often cite
the MPC as persuasive (that is, influential but not formally binding)
authority, but it is important to remember that the enacted legislation,
and not the MPC, is what controls within any jurisdiction. In other
words, even if a statute uses the mens rea term \"intentional\" in a
manner akin to the MPC\'s definition of \"purposeful,\" one may not
necessarily substitute one term for another. As you work through these
cases, train yourself to focus squarely on the actual language of a
given statute and how a lawyer advocating for either side might
interpret it.

A Note on Common Law v. the MPC

 

In this chapter, we will distinguish between states that are \"common
law jurisdictions\" and states that are \"Model Penal Code
jurisdictions.\" These are imperfect labels. No state that has adopted
the American Law Institute\'s entire Model Penal Code as its state
criminal code, and many courts in states that have not enacted any of
the Model Penal Code will onetheless look to, and cite, the Model Penal
Code as persuasive authority. But with respect to the mental state
requirements of criminal statutes, the basic distinction that these
labels convey is this: \"common law jurisdictions\" are those in which
the state\'s statutes and case law continue to use terms developed in
the common law, such as \"general intent,\" \"specific intent,\" and
\"malice.\" By contrast, \"Model Penal Code jurisdictions\" are those
states that have abandoned these terms and replaced them with statutory
definitions\--borrowed from the MPC\--of terms such as \"purposely,\"
\"knowingly,\" \"recklessly,\" and \"negligently,\" along with some
MPC-inspired rules for how to determine precisely what these terms
require within any specific criminal statute.

People v. Stark

 

 

Court of Appeal of California, Third Appellate District

26 Cal. App. 4th 1179, 31 Cal. Rptr. 2d 887 (1994)

 

PUGLIA, P. J.

A jury convicted defendant of willful diversion of construction funds
(Pen. Code, § 484b) and found the taking exceeded \$25,000 (Pen. Code, §
12022.6, subd. (a)). Imposition of sentence was suspended and defendant
was granted probation for five years.

... \[W\]e shall reject defendant's contention that the trial court
erred in instructing the jury that willful diversion of construction
funds is a general intent crime. Finding no error, we shall affirm.

In 1989, Doctors Steven Johnson and Douglas Martin contracted with
defendant, doing business as Stark Construction, to build a medical
facility for approximately \$350,000. The project was begun in October
1989, and as various phases of the project were completed, defendant
received partial payment from a construction loan obtained by the
doctors. With these payments defendant was to pay the subcontractors and
materialmen who had either performed work or provided materials for the
job.

By February 15, 1990, defendant had received three draws from the
construction loan, totalling about \$245,000. On March 1, the doctors
received several calls from subcontractors and materialmen informing the
doctors they had not been paid. The doctors discussed the matter with
defendant and it was agreed the doctors would thereafter write the
checks to the subcontractors and materialmen. The building was completed
on March 1. On March 16 the doctors issued approximately \$70,000 in
checks to subcontractors and material suppliers from the fourth draw.

When the doctors continued to receive calls from people who were
supposed to have been paid, but had not been paid, from the first three
draws, they again confronted defendant. Defendant informed the doctors
he had been experiencing financial difficulties on other jobs and some
of the money from the medical building project had been spent to defray
costs incurred for those jobs. Defendant promised to repay the money as
the other jobs progressed.

Months later, when money owed subcontractors and material suppliers
still had not been paid, the doctors contacted the Contractor's State
License Board and the district attorney. The doctors estimated
defendant's diversion of the funds cost them approximately \$46,000.

Defendant testified, admitting he used the money from the medical
building project to defray costs on some of his other jobs. However, he
always intended to pay the money back.

I

Penal Code section 484b provides in pertinent part:

"Any person who receives money for the purpose of obtaining or paying
for services, labor, materials or equipment and willfully fails to apply
such money for the such purpose by either willfully failing to complete
the improvements for which funds were provided or willfully failing to
pay for services, labor, materials or equipment provided incident to
such construction, and wrongfully diverts the funds to a use other than
that for which the funds were received, shall be guilty of a public
offense ...."

Relying on *People* v*. Dollar* (1991) 228 Cal. App. 3d 1335 and arguing
here as he did in the trial court, defendant contends Penal Code section
484b defines a specific intent crime. Therefore, he continues, the trial
court prejudicially erred when it instructed the jury the offense was
one requiring only general criminal intent. We conclude Penal Code
section 484b defines a general intent crime and that *Dollar* is
inapposite.

In *People* v. *Whitfield* (1994) 7 Cal.4th 437, the court reiterated
the general rule for differentiating between specific and general
criminal intent offenses: "\[As a\] general rule '\[w\]hen the
definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular
act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future
consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed
act. This intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the
definition refers to defendant's intent to do some further act or
achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of
specific intent.'" Id. at 449....

Defendant concedes there was a wrongful diversion of the construction
funds and that this act requires only general criminal intent, i.e.,
merely the intent to do the act. He contends there must exist in the
mind of the defendant the additional intent either to fail to complete
the work or, as in this case, not to pay either material suppliers or
subcontractors. Therefore, defendant argues, the offense is one of
specific intent.

The only "act" described by Penal Code section 484b is the wrongful
diversion, i.e., "a diversion to a use other than bona fide project
costs" (*People* v. *Butcher* (1986) 185 Cal. App. 3d 929, 938), of
funds accepted for one or more of the specific purposes set forth in
Penal Code section 484b. Nothing in section 484b suggests that when the
defendant wrongfully diverts the funds that he intend to do a further
act or to achieve a future consequence. The offense is complete if the
wrongful diversion was the cause of failure either to complete the
improvement or, as here, to pay for services, labor, materials or
equipment. It is immaterial whether defendant intended that there be a
failure either to complete the project or to pay subcontractors or
material suppliers. Consequently, the offense defined by section 484b is
one of general criminal intent, and the trial court did not err in so
instructing the jury.

*People* v. *Dollar*, *supra*, does not aid defendant. In that case the
accused, who had previously been convicted of committing a lewd and
lascivious act upon the victim, was thereafter convicted of threatening
her (Pen. Code, § 139) after he had unsuccessfully attempted to grab her
and, as she was running away, yelled, "I'll get you soon, bitch." (228
Cal. App. 3d at p. 1338.) On appeal the accused contended the trial
court erred in instructing the jury the offense was a general rather
than specific intent crime.

In pertinent part, Penal Code section 139 reads:

"(a) Except as provided in Sections 71 and 136.1, any person who has
been convicted of any felony offense specified in Section 12021.1 who
willfully and maliciously communicates to a witness to, or a victim of,
the crime for which the person was convicted, a credible threat to use
force or violence upon that person or that person's immediate family,
shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one
year or by imprisonment in the state prison .... (c) As used in this
section, 'a credible threat' is a threat made with the intent and the
apparent ability to carry out the threat so as to cause the target of
the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or the safety of his
or her immediate family."

In concluding the offense was one requiring a specific intent, the court
stated: "A threat as defined in section 139 would be a general intent
crime if it is merely the threat itself that is being proscribed by the
statute. If section 139 falls within the category of general intent
crimes, it cannot proscribe additional future goals or consequences
beyond the act of making the threat itself.... Section 139 draws a
distinction between an idle threat, a joke or a threat that no one would
believe, and a credible threat, which the section defines. For a threat
to be credible, the criminal actor must have the apparent ability to
carry out the threat and must have the additional criminal intent to
cause the victim of the threat fear \[*sic*\] for him or herself or for
his or her immediate family. The communication of the threat itself is
the act. The intent to create a future or additional consequence is the
intent to cause the victim to feel fear or intimidation." (228 Cal. App.
3d at p. 1341.)

As noted above, in cases arising under section 484b it is immaterial
whether at the time of the wrongful diversion the defendant intends or
desires that the improvement not be completed or the suppliers and
subcontractors not be paid. To violate the statute all that it required
is the wrongful diversion of the funds, which means not applying the
funds for the purpose for which they were disbursed, and that the
diversion be the cause of at least one of the described failures. In
contrast, a violation of Penal Code section 139 requires the making of
the threat coupled with the intent to cause fear in the target of the
threat, thus defining an additional mental state not required by Penal
Code section 488b. We conclude *Dollar* is of no assistance to
defendant....

The judgment is affirmed.

BROWN, J.

In this case we determine the required mens rea for a conviction of
felony child abuse based on direct infliction of unjustifiable physical
pain and mental suffering. (Pen. Code, § 273a, former subd. (1), now §
273a, subd. (a) (section 273a(1)).) The Court of Appeal concluded
criminal negligence is required. We disagree, and therefore reverse its
judgment.

1.  Facts And Procedural Background

Michael Sargent, Jr. (Michael), defendant's son, was born on March 24,
1993, three months premature. He weighed two pounds, four ounces, and
spent the first three months of his life in the hospital. By August 19,
1993, he was the equivalent of a four to six-week-old infant in terms of
neck muscle development. On that date, Marysville Fire Department
personnel and a paramedic responding to a "911" call found Michael in a
deep coma and close to death on defendant's apartment floor. He was not
breathing, had no heartbeat, no eye or motor movement, and no response
to verbal stimuli. There was bright red blood coming from his nose and
mouth.

Michael was ultimately airlifted to the University of California at
Davis Medical Center. While Michael's subsequent condition was not made
clear at trial, it appears he survived and was released from the
hospital on September 3, 1993.

Defendant's explanation of Michael's injuries varied. On August 19,
1993, defendant told a neighbor, paramedic, and hospital personnel
Michael had rolled off the couch and fallen 18 to 20 inches to a
carpeted floor. On August 24, 1993, defendant was interviewed by the
police. He denied dropping Michael or losing his temper.

On August 25, 1993, defendant was again interviewed by the police. He
stated he had dropped Michael while throwing him up in the air to stop
him from crying, causing Michael to strike his head on the linoleum
kitchen floor. The interviewing officers told defendant a consulting
physician had concluded Michael was a victim of shaken baby syndrome.
Defendant initially denied Michael was ever shaken. He then changed his
story a third time. He said he and Michael's mother had an argument, and
she dropped defendant and Michael off at the house. Defendant carried
Michael in his car seat into the house. The infant was crying
inconsolably. Defendant started to try to make a bottle for Michael.
When Michael continued crying, defendant shook him front to back as
Michael sat in his car seat. Defendant then returned to making the
bottle. When Michael continued to cry, and refused a pacifier, "that's
when I was shaking him more hard." Defendant shook Michael four or five
times, causing the infant's head to lose contact with the car seat "a
couple of times." Michael stopped crying. He "had this weird look in his
eyes \... like \[he\] was going to sleep you know like he was falling or
something." When defendant picked him up, Michael's back bowed. His eyes
closed, and he appeared to have difficulty breathing.

Defendant was charged with felony child abuse (§ 273a(1)), alleged to be
a serious felony because it involved the personal infliction of great
bodily injury. (§§ 667, subd. (a), 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).) It was further
alleged that defendant had suffered a prior serious felony conviction
for burglary (§§ 459, 667, subd. (a); 1192.7, subd. (c)(18)), and served
two prior prison terms (§ 667.5, subd. (b)).

At trial, Dr. John McCann, a pediatrician and director of the Davis
Medical Center's child protection program, testified as a medical expert
on child abuse for the prosecution. When Michael arrived at the Davis
Medical Center he was sedated and consequently paralyzed because he
appeared to be having seizures. No bruises or other external trauma,
except for swelling around the eyes, were observed. A CAT (computerized
axial tomography) scan revealed bilateral subdural hematomas, or blood
over the surface of Michael's brain on both sides behind his ears. In
addition, his brain was swollen. During his examination of Michael, Dr.
McCann observed flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages in both eyes.

Based on all of this information, Dr. McCann opined Michael was a victim
of shaken baby syndrome. Seventy to seventy-five percent of the children
injured by shaking suffer either severe long-term disabling injury, such
as blindness, seizures, and difficulty walking or talking, or death.
McCann stated that shaking Michael was a circumstance likely to result
in great bodily injury or death. For a fall to have caused the injuries
sustained, Michael would have to fall out a second story window, not off
the couch or from his father's arms.

Dr. Todd Brandtman testified as a defense medical expert. He was an
emergency room physician who had neither treated nor examined Michael.
He did not have expertise in child abuse. He testified Michael's
injuries could have resulted from being dropped, and that photographs of
Michael taken two days after he left the hospital showed a swollen spot
on the back of his head....

The jury was instructed that it could find defendant guilty of violating
section 273a(1) based on general criminal intent if it found defendant
willfully inflicted unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering on
Michael. In addition, the jury was required to find the infliction
occurred under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great
bodily harm or death. The jury was further instructed that permitting a
child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or when
having the care or custody of a child permitting the child to be
injured, or permitting the child to be placed in a situation that
endangers the child's person or health in violation of section 273a(1)
required criminal negligence. Both general criminal intent and criminal
negligence were defined.

The prosecutor argued that the jury could conclude defendant committed
child abuse whether it found defendant had shaken Michael with general
criminal intent, or dropped Michael with criminal negligence, and that
this crime was a felony if it was committed under circumstances or
conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.

The jury found defendant guilty of a violation of section 273a(1). The
verdict did not indicate which branch of section 273a(1) the jury found
defendant had violated, that is, whether defendant had directly
inflicted the abuse by shaking Michael, or had been criminally negligent
in dropping him. In a bifurcated court trial, the enhancement
allegations were found true. The court sentenced defendant to the upper
term of six years for the felony child abuse count, with a consecutive
five-year enhancement.

The Court of Appeal, with one justice dissenting, concluded criminal
negligence must be demonstrated to convict a defendant of infliction of
unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, and the evidence did
not support the inference that defendant was criminally negligent. The
court relied on cases involving other branches of section 273a(1) that
generally required criminal negligence. It disagreed with *People v.
Atkins* (1975) 53 Cal. App. 3d 348 ..., concluding their interpretation
of section 273a(1) "reads out of the statute the element which embodies
criminal negligence, the requirement that the culpable conduct occur in
circumstances likely to produce great bodily harm or death."

The court further concluded that "\[t\]here is nothing in the record
from which it can be inferred that the defendant knew or should have
known of the risk of great bodily harm or death from shaking the infant,
e.g., attendance at a prenatal education session concerning this
risk\.... Nor can we take judicial notice that such a risk is generally
known.... The defendant denied knowledge of the syndrome and the record
is devoid of evidence showing that he knew or should have known of the
syndrome. Accordingly, there is no basis for a finding that he knew or
should have known that great bodily injury or death is likely to result
from shaking his baby."

Finally, the court concluded that "defendant was convicted under the
second branch of section \[273a(1)\], the 'inflict\[ion of\] \...
unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering' upon a child 'under
circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death
\....'" The prosecution was not predicated on criminal negligence in
dropping Michael. While defendant testified "he dropped the child and
that is how the child was injured \... there was no evidence of fracture
or bruises which would support that theory and the prosecution
introduced extensive evidence to refute the claim. Given that strong
evidence supporting the prosecution's theory of the mechanism of injury,
it is entirely unlikely that the conviction was predicated upon dropping
the baby." Rather, "there is far more than a 'reasonable probability'
that the jury in fact found the defendant guilty solely on the shaken
baby syndrome theory. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant's
felony conviction cannot be affirmed." The court modified the judgment
to a conviction of violation of section 273a, former subdivision (2), a
misdemeanor, and remanded to the trial court for resentencing. The
judgment was otherwise affirmed....

1.  DISCUSSION

2.  *Background*

3.  *General Intent and Criminal Negligence*

\(1\) Section 20 provides, "In every crime or public offense there must
exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, or criminal
negligence." (See also § 26, subd. Five \[persons incapable of
committing crime include those "who committed the act or made the
omission charged through misfortune or by accident, when it appears that
there was no evil design, intention, or culpable negligence"\].) Intent
can be either general or specific. "When the definition of a crime
consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference
to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask
whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intention
is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the definition refers to
defendant's intent to do some further act or achieve some additional
consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent." (*People
v. Hood* (1969) 1 Cal. 3d 444, 456-457.) General criminal intent thus
requires no further mental state beyond willing commission of the act
proscribed by law.

Criminal negligence is "'aggravated, culpable, gross, or reckless, that
is, \... such a departure from what would be the conduct of an
ordinarily prudent or careful \[person\] under the same circumstances as
to be incompatible with a proper regard for human life ....'" (*People
v. Penny* (1955) 44 Cal. 2d 861, 879 \[285 P.2d 926\].) "Under the
criminal negligence standard, knowledge of the risk is determined by an
objective test: '\[I\]f a reasonable person in defendant's position
would have been aware of the risk involved, then defendant is presumed
to have had such an awareness.'" (*Williams v. Garcetti* (1993) 5 Cal.
4th 561, 574 ....)

Section 273a(1) is an omnibus statute that proscribes essentially four
branches of conduct. At the time of defendant's crimes, and in
substantively identical form currently, it provided: "Any person who,
under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or
death, \[1\] willfully causes or permits any child to suffer, or \[2\]
inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or
\[3\] having the care or custody of any child, willfully causes or
permits the person or health of such child to be injured, or \[4\]
willfully causes or permits such child to be placed in such situation
that its person or health is endangered, is punishable by imprisonment
in the county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 2,
4, or 6 years." (*Ibid*.)

\(2\) We have observed that violation of section 273a(1) "can occur in a
wide variety of situations: the definition broadly includes both active
and passive conduct, i.e., child abuse by direct assault and child
endangering by extreme neglect." (*People v. Smith* (1984) 35 Cal. 3d
798, 806.) We have also observed, however, that "\[t\]wo threshold
considerations \... govern all types of conduct prohibited by this law:
first, the conduct must be willful; second, it must be committed 'under
circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or
death.' (§ 273a, subd. (1).) Absent either of these elements, there can
be no violation of the statute." ...

We have not previously addressed the question of the appropriate mens
rea for direct infliction of abuse cases under section 273a....

In *People v. Peabody* (1975) 46 Cal. App. 3d 43, the defendant's
four-month-old infant suffered multiple nonaccidental fractures. (*Id*.
at pp. 45-46.) There was no evidence that the defendant, as opposed to
the baby's father, had inflicted the injuries on her child. (*Id*. at p.
46.) Thus, "the conviction can stand only under that portion of the
statute which proscribes a person from wilfully causing or permitting a
child to be placed in a health endangering situation under circumstances
likely to produce great bodily harm or death." (*Ibid*., italics
omitted.) The court held that under these circumstances, section 273a(1)
"requires proof of criminal negligence." (46 Cal. App. 3d at p. 48.) ...

Moreover, other than the Court of Appeal opinion in this case, those
cases which impose a criminal negligence requirement involve indirect
abuse, such as failing to seek medical treatment, child endangerment, or
willfully permitting situations that imperil children. (See, e.g.,
*Walker v. Superior Court, supra*, 47 Cal. 3d at pp. 118, 135 \[failure
to obtain medical care resulting in 4-year-old's death\]; *People v.
Hansen* (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 473, 476-478 \[34-year-old man
encouraged 14-year-old neighbor to play fatal game of Russian
roulette\]; *...* *People v. Lee* (1991) 234 Cal. App. 3d 1214,
1217-1218, 1221 \[mother convicted of second degree murder and felony
child endangerment for death of emaciated and dehydrated infant\];
*People v. Rippberger* (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 1667, 1673, 1682
\[failure to seek medical treatment for child suffering from
meningitis\]; *People v. Odom* (1991) 226 Cal. App. 3d 1028, 1031, 1032
\[children living in squalor, and surrounded by highly dangerous drug
lab and weapons\]; *...* *Cline v. Superior Court* (1982) 135 Cal. App.
3d 943, 945-946, 948-949 \[father endangered toddler by throwing him
into a car driven by another and then encouraging or knowingly
permitting dangerous ride\].)

However, a number of cases involving indirect abuse and child
endangerment broadly state, as did *Walker v. Superior Court*, *supra*,
47 Cal. 3d at page 135, that section 273a is a criminal negligence
statute). ...

1.  *Appropriate Mens Rea When Child Abuse Directly Inflicted*

(4a) We first consider whether a violation of section 273a(1) based on
direct infliction of unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering
requires proof of general criminal intent or criminal negligence. As
noted above, the Court of Appeal concluded that criminal negligence is
required; defendant urges us to adopt this view. The Attorney General
argues that only general criminal intent is required.

We begin with the language of the statute. The language "inflicts \[on a
child\] unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering" is most readily
interpreted as requiring general criminal intent. That is, the statute
describes "a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further
act or achieve a future consequence." (*People v. Hood, supra*, 1 Cal.
3d at pp. 456-457.)

Moreover, the language of section 273a(1) is similar to that of section
273d, which proscribes corporal punishment or child beating. ... Section
273d has been interpreted as a general intent statute. (*People v.
Atkins, supra*, 53 Cal. App. 3d at p. 358 \["\[t\]here need not be found
a deliberate intent to cause a traumatic condition, but only the more
general intent to inflict upon a child any cruel or inhuman corporal
punishment or injury"\] .... Given the similarities between section
273a(1) and section 273d, the mens rea element should be the same....

Defendant asserts that section 273a(1) and section 273d differ
significantly because section 273a(1), but not section 273d, requires
that the culpable conduct occur "under circumstances or conditions
likely to produce great bodily harm or death." ...

Section 273a does not provide that a defendant must "know or reasonably
should know that his or her actions occur under circumstances or
conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death." Rather, the
statute proscribes the infliction of unjustifiable physical pain or
mental suffering on a child. Whether that infliction is "under
circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or
death" is a question for the trier of fact....

The scienter for any crime is inextricably linked to the proscribed act
or omission. (See § 20 \["In every crime or public offense there must
exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, or criminal
negligence."\].) The actus reus for section 273a(1) is infliction of
unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering on a child. Hence, the
scienter requirement applies to such an act. There is no separate
scienter which attaches to the phrase "circumstances or conditions
likely to produce great bodily harm or death."

We note this inquiry, as a practical matter, will in most cases not
differ significantly from the imposition of a criminal negligence mens
rea element into the language "under circumstances or conditions likely
to produce great bodily harm or death." Thus in this case, while
defendant denied any awareness that his actions were likely to harm
Michael, any reasonable person would recognize that shaking a
four-and-a-half-month-old infant, who had been born three months
prematurely and had the neck development of a fourto six-week-old, with
the force equivalent to dropping him out of a second story window, was a
circumstance or condition likely to result in great bodily harm or
death....

Nor, contrary to defendant's assertion, will section 273a(1) be
tantamount to a strict liability crime if we do not conclude criminal
negligence is a required element of the statute. (5) Generally speaking,
a strict liability offense is one which dispenses with a mens rea,
scienter, or wrongful intent element. (See *People v. Simon* (1995) 9
Cal. 4th 493, 519.) Felony child abuse requires a mens rea: the
defendant must willfully inflict unjustifiable physical pain or mental
suffering on a child.

At oral argument, defendant's counsel asserted that concluding the
second branch of section 273a(1) has a general criminal intent mens rea
would result in parents being prosecuted for shaking a child or slapping
it on the back to save it from choking. However, shaking or slapping a
choking child, whatever physical pain or mental suffering that may
involve, is justified. Section 273a(1) sanctions only the infliction of
*unjustifiable* physical pain or mental suffering.

In sum, we conclude that when the conduct at issue involves the direct
infliction of unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering on a
child, criminal negligence is not an element of the offense. Rather, the
defendant must have a mens rea of general criminal intent to commit the
proscribed act. In addition, the trier of fact must determine whether
the infliction of the unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering on
a child was under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great
bodily harm or death. If so, the crime is punishable as a felony. If
not, it is punishable solely as a misdemeanor....

The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

7 Section 273d, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part: "Any person
who willfully inflicts upon a child any cruel or inhuman corporal
punishment or injury resulting in a traumatic condition is guilty of a
felony \...."

3 The jury was instructed in the language of CALJIC Nos. 1.20, 3.30,
3.36, 4.45, 9.37: "In the crime charged in Count I of the Information
and in the lesser \[included\] crime there must exist a union or joint
operation of act or conduct and general criminal intent. To constitute
general criminal intent, it's not necessary that there exist an intent
to violate the law. When a person intentionally does that which the law
declares to be a crime he or she is acting with general criminal
intent\[\] \[e\]ven though he or she may not know that the act or
conduct is unlawful. "When a person commits an act or makes an omission
through misfortune or by accident under circumstances that show neither
criminal intent nor purpose nor criminal negligence, he or she does not
thereby commit a crime. "The Defendant is accused in Count I of the
Information of having violated Section 273(a)(1) of the Penal Code, a
crime. Every person who under circumstances or conditions likely to
produce great bodily harm or death, one, willfully inflicts
unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering on a child or, two,
willfully causes or as a result of criminal negligence permits a child
to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering or, three, has
care or custody of a child and, A, willfully causes or \... as a result
of criminal negligence, permits the child to be injured or, B, willfully
causes or as a result of criminal negligence permits the child to be
placed in a situation that endangers the child's person or health is
guilty of a violation of Section 273(a)(1) of the Penal Code, a crime.
The word 'willfully' as used in this instruction means with knowledge of
the consequences or purposefully. "In the crime charged in the
Information there must exist a union or joint operation of act or
conduct and either general criminal intent or criminal negligence. To
establish general criminal intent, it's not necessary that there should
exist an intent to violate the law. A person who intentionally does that
which the law declares to be a crime is acting with general criminal
intent even though he may not know that such act or conduct is unlawful.
"Unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering is the infliction of
pain or suffering which cannot be defended or excused under the
circumstances as reasonable, both as to necessity and to degree. "Great
bodily harm refers to significant or substantial injury and does not
refer to trivial or insignificant injury. If a child is placed in a
situation likely to produce great bodily harm or death it is not
necessary that \... actual bodily injury occur in order to constitute
the offense. However, if such bodily injury does occur, its nature and
extent are to be considered in connection with all of the evidence in
determining whether the circumstances were such as were likely to
produce great bodily harm or death. "In order to prove such a crime each
of the following elements must be proved: A person willfully inflicted
unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering on a child or a person
willfully causes or as a result of criminal negligence permitted a child
to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering or, one, a
person having care or custody of a child, A, willfully caused or as a
result of criminal negligence permitted the child to be injured or, B,
willfully caused or as a result of criminal negligence permitted the
child to be placed in a situation that endangered the child's person or
health. And, two, such conduct occurs under circumstances likely to
produce great bodily harm or death. "Criminal negligence means conduct
which is more than ordinary negligence. Ordinary negligence is the
failure to exercise ordinary or reasonable care. Criminal negligence
refers to a negligent act which is aggravated, reckless and gross and
which is such a departure from that which would be the conduct of an
ordinarily, prudent, careful person under the same circumstances as to
be contrary to a proper regard for human life or to constitute
indifference to the consequences of such act. The facts must be such
that the consequences of the negligent act could reasonably have been
foreseen and it must appear that the danger to human life was not the
result of inattention, mistaken judgment or misadventure but the natural
and probable result of an aggravated, reckless or grossly negligent
act." "The word 'willfully' when applied to the intent with which an act
is done or omitted means with a purpose or willingness to commit the act
or make the omission in question. The word 'willfully' does not require
any intent to violate the law or to injure another or to acquire any
advantage."

2 Section 273a was enacted in 1905 to read: "Any person who willfully
causes or permits any child to suffer, or who inflicts thereon
unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, and whoever, having the
care or custody of any child, causes or permits the life or limb of such
child to be endangered, or the health of such child to be injured, and
any person who willfully causes or permits such child to be placed in
such situation that its life or limb may be endangered, or its health
likely to be injured, is guilty of a misdemeanor." (Stats. 1905, ch.
568, § 5, p. 759.) The statute was not amended until 1963, when the
former misdemeanor offense was made an alternative felony/misdemeanor
offense. (Stats. 1963, ch. 783, § 1, p. 1811.) In 1965, the section was
divided into subdivisions (1) and (2), which were separate
felony/misdemeanor and misdemeanor provisions. In addition, the language
"under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm
or death" was added to new subdivision (1). (Stats. 1965, ch. 697, § 1,
p. 2091.) In 1993, subdivisions (1) and (2) were redesignated
subdivisions (a)(1) and (b). (Stats. 1993, ch. 1253, § 1.) In 1994,
subdivisions (a)(1) and (b) were redesignated subdivisions (a) and (b).
(Stats. 1994, ch. 1263, § 3.) At the time of defendant's crime, former
section 273a provided: "(1) Any person who, under circumstances or
conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, willfully
causes or permits any child to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable
physical pain or mental suffering, or having the care or custody of any
child, willfully causes or permits the person or health of such child to
be injured, or willfully causes or permits such child to be placed in
such situation that its person or health is endangered, is punishable by
imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state
prison for 2, 4, or 6 years. "(2) Any person who, under circumstances or
conditions other than those likely to produce great bodily harm or
death, willfully causes or permits any child to suffer, or inflicts
thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or having the
care or custody of any child, willfully causes or permits the person or
health of such child to be injured, or willfully causes or permits such
child to be placed in such situation that its person or health may be
endangered, is guilty of a misdemeanor." (Stats. 1984, ch. 1423, § 2,
pp. 4994-4995.) The current version of section 273a is substantively
identical. As relevant here, the sole difference between the two
subdivisions is that former subdivision (1), now subdivision (a),
punishable as a felony or misdemeanor, requires that the proscribed
conduct occur in "circumstances or conditions likely to produce great
bodily harm or death"; former subdivision (2), now subdivision (b), a
misdemeanor, has no such requirement.

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

Criminal offense definitions nearly always require proof of something
more than an "act," or conduct. In the standard description, criminal
offenses may have three kinds of elements: (1) conduct, (2)
circumstances, and (3) results. Murder is the classic offense defined by
the result ("causing the death of another"). Not all offenses have all
three types; many offenses require no result or consequence.
Circumstance elements include a wide range statutory requirement---e.g.,
the victim's age (as in a child abuse or statutory rape statute); the
time of day or the status of the building (burglary was once defined as
entry into "the dwelling house of another at nighttime"); surrounding
conditions (conduct done "in circumstances likely to cause harm"); or
who owns property (taking of "the property of another"). Can you
identify the all the elements in the offenses at issue in *Stark* and
*Sargent*?

*Stark* repeats the standard definition of general intent: "the intent
to do the act." For some offenses, that provides a clear answer about
the *mens rea* of the offense. But for other offenses, such as the
statute at issue *Sargent*, "general intent" provides a less clear
answer. There, the key question is whether the prosecution must prove
something more about the defendant's mental state regarding other
elements of the crime. This is one reason that courts and commentators
have long complained that "Specific and general intent have been
notoriously difficult terms to define and apply, and a number of text
writers recommend that they be abandoned altogether." People v. Hood,
462 P.2d 370 (Cal. 1969). But determining what else, beyond his conduct,
that an offender must intend, know, or be aware of can pose difficult
interpretative questions, as in *Sargent*.

California's felony child abuse statute effectively defines more than
one offense, because harm can be inflicted directly (or actively) by the
defendant, or indirectly (or passively) by, for example, permitting
someone else to abuse the child. Both forms of child abuse are general
intent crimes. General intent answers the mens rea question relatively
easily for direct infliction cases---the offender must intend his
physical actions. But *Sargent* follows earlier California cases, such
as Walker v. Superior Court, 763 P.2d 852 (Cal. 1988), in concluding
that, in passive cases, the defendant must have intended his conduct
*and* been criminally negligent. That is not, as we will see next, a
requirement of "specific intent." But it is something more than merely
"intent to do the act." Can you explain why the court concluded that
this additional negligence requirement is important to ensuring that
only culpable, blameworthy actors are convicted in such cases?

 

 

 

Note on \'willful blindness\'

 

In some circumstances, defendants\' claims that they lack the
\"knowning\" or \"intentional\" mens rea required for an offense is
proven by means of the doctrine of \"willful blindness,\" also known as
\"deliberate ignorance\" or \"conscious avoidance.\" A recent Eleventh
Circuit provides a representative account of the doctrine. See United
States v. Pineda, 843 Fed. Appx. 174, 179-180 (11^th^ Cir. 2021):

We \"consistently\" have recognized \"deliberate ignorance of criminal
activity as the equivalent of knowledge.\" United States v. Arias, 984
F.2d 1139, 1143 (11th Cir. 1993). Deliberate ignorance occurs when \"a
party has his suspicion aroused but then deliberately omits to make
further enquiries, because he wishes to remain in ignorance ....\"
United States v. Rivera, 944 F.2d 1563, 1570 (11th Cir. 1991). A
deliberate ignorance instruction \[to the jury\] is appropriate where
the facts \"support the inference that the defendant was aware of a high
probability of the existence of the fact in question and purposely
contrived to avoid learning all of the facts in order to have a defense
in the event of a subsequent prosecution.\" Id. at 1571. Where \"the
evidence could support both actual knowledge or deliberate ignorance,\"
the district court may instruct the jury on both methods of establishing
the defendant\'s knowledge.....

\[In this case, the\] facts all support the inference that Pineda
purposely avoided learning about the fraud \.... See *Rivera*, 944 F.2d
at 1571 (explaining that the deliberate ignorance instruction is
warranted where the defendant \"purposely avoided learning all the facts
necessary to obtain positive knowledge\"); United States v. Maitre, 898
F.3d 1151, 1157 (11th Cir. 2018) (concluding there was sufficient
evidence of deliberate ignorance in identity theft case where the
defendant accepted fifteen to twenty purses from her boyfriend as
gifts---some containing \"other people\'s wallets and IDs\"---even
though she \"knew he didn\'t have a job\").

For an excellent, short account of the distinctions between \"actual
knowledge,\" \"willful blindness\" and a \"should have known\" mens rea,
as well as the challenges of proving a party\'s subjective knowledge or
beliefs, see Daniel Richman, *Actual Knowledge, Willful Blindness, and
the Jan. 6
Hearings*, [LawFare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/actual-knowledge-willful-blindness-and-jan-6-hearings)
blog, June 21, 2022 (\"defendants cannot escape criminal liability \'by
deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts
that are strongly suggested by the circumstances. \... \[D\]efendants
who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual
knowledge.\'\").

The U.S. Supreme Court summarized the doctrine of willful blindness (or
\"conscious avoidance\") in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A.,
563 U.S. 754 (2011):

The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in criminal law.
Many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or
willfully, and courts applying the doctrine of willful blindness hold
that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by
deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts
that are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The traditional
rationale for this doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner
are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge. Edwards, *The
Criminal Degrees of Knowledge*, 17 Mod. L. Rev. 294, 302 (1954)
(observing on the basis of English authorities that "up to the present
day, no real doubt has been cast on the proposition that \[willful
blindness\] is as culpable as actual knowledge"). It is also said that
persons who know enough to blind themselves to direct proof of critical
facts in effect have actual knowledge of those facts.

A federal district court cited *Global-Tech Appliances* in rejecting
Danean MacAndrew\'s defense tthat on January 6, 2021, \"she was unaware
she was unlawfully present in the Capitol because she focused her entire
attention on the four-inch screen of her phone while inside.\"
(Preoccupation with a cell phone is a dismaying credible claim these
days, but it remains a weak defense.) The court convicted of MacAndrew
of various offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a) and 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)
such as \"Violent Entry and Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol Building.\"
MacAndrew\'s claim of having lacked awareness was partly belied by her
own social media: \"Defendant herself captured numerous instances of
events placing her on notice that her presence was unlawful, including
her exclamation while inside the Capitol that she believed she was being
teargassed.\" She also conceded in testimony that she found \"the events
around her \'strange\' and not at all akin to the prior pro-Trump events
she had attended,\" not least because she \"enter\[ed\] the United
States Capitol without security screening and with her backpack \...
after she witnessed other members of the crowd suffering from the
effects of pepper spray.\" The court concluded that MacAndrew either
knew she had entered and remained in the Capitol unlawfully or she was
willfully blind to that fact, noting:

\"willful blindness\" (sometimes termed \"willful ignorance\") is one
method by which a factfinder may conclude that a defendant \"knowingly\"
committed a criminal act. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.,
563 U.S. 754, 766 (2011)\.... In general, where a defendant \"knows or
strongly suspects that he is involved in criminal dealings but
deliberately avoids learning more exact information about the nature of
extent of those dealings,\" that defendant is said to act \"knowingly.\"

State v. Schminkey

 

Iowa Supreme Court

597 N.W.2d 785 (1999)

TERNUS, Justice.

The defendant, William Schminkey, entered *Alford* pleas to the offenses
of homicide by vehicle, *see* Iowa Code § 707.6A(.1) (1997), and theft
of a motor vehicle, *see id.* §§ 714.1, .2(2). *See generally North
Carolina v. Alford,* 400 U.S. 25, 37 (1970) (holding that an accused may
consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is unwilling
or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the
crime). The court sentenced him to consecutive ten-year and five-year
terms of imprisonment, respectively. Schminkey now claims that the
record lacks a sufficient factual basis for a finding that he was guilty
of the theft offense....

We agree that the record does not show a factual basis for Schminkey's
conviction of the crime of theft of a motor vehicle. This conclusion
makes it unnecessary to consider Schminkey's claim that the State
breached the plea agreement. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence on the
theft conviction and remand for further proceedings....

The underlying facts of the tragic episode culminating in Schminkey's
convictions are undisputed. Because the ultimate focus in this case is
on the record before the district court at the time of the guilty plea
proceedings, we recite the facts as they appeared to the court during
that phase of the case.

Schminkey spent the evening of May 17, 1997, drinking, first at a party
and then at a bar. Although Schminkey has no recollection of leaving the
bar or of what happened after he left, witnesses established that he
departed the bar and then drove a pickup owned by Dale Kimm, a man
Schminkey did not know. Schminkey did not have Kimm's permission to
drive the pickup. Several witnesses observed the pickup being driven
erratically and in excess of the speed limit. They saw the vehicle
heading north, approaching a controlled intersection in the town of Van
Horne at an excessive rate of speed. The pickup went through the
intersection without slowing down and struck two vehicles facing south,
that were stopped at the intersection stop sign. The driver and only
occupant of the first vehicle, nineteen-year-old Jason Kray, died en
route to the hospital.

Notwithstanding the collision, the driver of the pickup appeared to be
fleeing the scene, accelerating the engine and proceeding down the road
for another block or so before crashing into a fence. Witnesses who
assisted in extricating Schminkey from the pickup said he smelled
strongly of alcohol. A later urine test showed his blood alcohol level
to be .189, significantly over the legal limit of .10. *See* Iowa Code §
321J.2(1).

Schminkey was charged with homicide by vehicle in violation of Iowa Code
section 707.6A(1), involuntary manslaughter in violation of Iowa Code
section 707.5(1), and theft of a motor vehicle in violation of Iowa Code
sections 714.1 and 714.2(2). Claiming he was unable to recall the events
of the evening due to his intoxication, Schminkey entered into a plea
agreement with the State, whereby, in exchange for his *Alford* plea to
the theft and homicide charges, the State would dismiss the involuntary
manslaughter charge and recommend that Schminkey's sentences on the
remaining charges run concurrently.

The State dismissed the manslaughter charge. At the plea hearing, the
district court made a determination that a factual basis for the pleas
appeared in the record and then accepted Schminkey's guilty pleas.
Schminkey was subsequently sentenced to consecutive ten-year and
five-year terms of incarceration\....

The district court may not accept a guilty plea without first
determining that the plea has a factual basis. *See* Iowa R. Crim. P.
8(2)(b); *State v. Burtlow,* 299 N.W.2d 665, 668 (Iowa 1980). This
requirement exists even where the plea is an *Alford* plea. *See
Alford,* 400 U.S. at 38 n. 10\.... In deciding whether a factual basis
exists, we consider the entire record before the district court at the
guilty plea hearing, including any statements made by the defendant,
facts related by the prosecutor, the minutes of testimony, and the
presentence report....

The offense of theft is defined in section 714.1(1), which states that a
person commits theft when he "\[t\]akes possession or control of the
property of another, or property in the possession of another, *with
the* *intent to deprive the other thereof."* (Emphasis added.) Schminkey
challenges the factual basis for the intent element of this crime.

The intent required for the commission of a theft is an intent to
deprive the owner of his or her property. *See Eggman v. Scurr,* 311
N.W.2d 77, 79 (Iowa 1981). Schminkey argues that this element of the
crime requires proof that he intended to *permanently* deprive the owner
of his vehicle. He contrasts the theft statute, section 714.1(1), with
Iowa Code section 714.7, defining the crime of operating a vehicle
without the owner's consent. The latter statute prohibits the
"possession or control of \... any self-propelled vehicle \... without
the consent of the owner of such, *but without the intent to permanently
deprive the owner thereof."* Iowa Code § 714.7 (emphasis added). This
crime, operating a vehicle without the owner's consent, is expressly
made a lesser included offense of the crime of theft. *See id.*

Schminkey correctly argues that an intent to *permanently* deprive the
owner of his property is an essential element of theft under section
714.1(1). The legislature's distinction of the crime of theft from the
crime of operating a vehicle without the owner's consent --- the
existence or absence of an intent to *permanently* deprive the owner ---
supports this conclusion. In addition, this interpretation of section
714.1(1) is consistent with the crime of larceny as it was defined prior
to the revision of Iowa's criminal laws in 1978.... Prior to the
criminal code revisions, the crime of larceny, *see* Iowa Code § 709.1
(1977), and the separate crime of larceny of a motor vehicle, *see id.*
§ 321.82, required proof of an intent to permanently deprive the owner
of the stolen property or vehicle.... In one of the few cases in which
this court has addressed the issue of intent since the criminal code
revisions, we held that the record must demonstrate more than an intent
to temporarily deprive the owner of the property in order to prove a
theft. *See Fluhr,* 287 N.W.2d at 867....

Because proof that the defendant acted with the specific purpose of
depriving the owner of his property requires a determination of what the
defendant was thinking when an act was done, it is seldom capable of
being established with direct evidence.... Accordingly, we *examine* the
record *for* facts and circumstances that would support an inference
that Schminkey intended to permanently take possession of the truck.

The record upon which the trial court could draw to determine whether a
factual basis existed for Schminkey's plea of guilty to the theft charge
was minimal. Because Schminkey entered an *Alford,* plea, he made no
admissions with respect to his commission of this crime. The county
attorney made no factual statements. The presentence report had not been
completed. The court merely had before it the minutes of testimony....

From the minutes of testimony, it can be established that at 7 p.m. on
the day of the accident, Schminkey accompanied a friend to a party where
he consumed several beers. He eventually left that party and went to a
bar where he drank more alcohol. Later in the evening, at approximately
10:45 p.m., Schminkey was seen driving a pickup from Blairstown to Van
Horne. Minutes later, he was involved in the accident described above,
and then crashed the vehicle into a fence a block or two from the
accident scene. The minutes also show that the owner of the pickup had
parked the vehicle in Blairstown and had not given Schminkey permission
to drive it.

We find no facts or circumstances in this recitation that would allow an
inference that Schminkey intended to *permanently* deprive the owner of
his vehicle. In a similar case that arose under Iowa's old larceny
statute, this court reversed a conviction based on a guilty plea in part
on the ground that the trial court could not have found a factual basis
for the defendant's guilty plea because the record did not establish a
factual basis for the intent element of the crime. *Brainard,* 222
N.W.2d at 721 (plurality opinion). In *Brainard,* the defendant admitted
in the plea colloquy that he took another's automobile without
permission. *Id.* at 720. He denied that he intended to sell the car,
but he admitted that he did not intend to bring it back. *Id.* This
court stated that "\[t\]he essential question as to \[the defendant's\]
intent is whether he intended to deprive the owner permanently of his
automobile." *Id.* at 721. We concluded the record did not show a
factual basis for finding that the defendant had that intent. *Id.*
Without that intent, we noted, he would at most be guilty of the lesser
offense of operating a motor vehicle without the owner's consent. *Id.*

Under analogous circumstances, the court of appeals has also concluded
the record lacked a factual basis for a finding of intent. *State v.
Henning,* 299 N.W.2d 909, 911 (Iowa App.1980). In *Henning,* the
defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault with intent to inflict
serious injury. *Id.* at 909. During the plea colloquy, he acknowledged
being involved in a fight, but stated that he did not otherwise remember
the event. *Id.* at 911. The court of appeals found the record adequate
to show a factual basis for the defendant's *acts,* but not to show a
factual basis for the requisite *intent. Id.*

Other states have, under similar facts, reached the same result as did
our courts in *Brainard* and *Henning.* \[Citations to cases from
Florida, Maryland, and Mississippi omitted.\]

We acknowledge the general statements made in some of our prior cases
that possession of stolen property creates an inference supporting a
conviction of larceny. *See State v. Rosewall,* 239 N.W.2d 171, 174
(Iowa 1976); *State v. Everett,* 157 N.W.2d 144, 146 (Iowa 1968); *State
v. Brightman,* 252 Iowa 1278, 1284, 110 N.W.2d 315, 318 (1961); *State
v. Girdler,* 251 Iowa 868, 873, 102 N.W.2d 877, 879 (1960). In none of
these cases, however, was the defendant's intent at issue. In
*Brightman,* a suit stolen from a dry cleaning business was discovered
in the defendant's home six months after it had been taken.... The
defendant claimed that he had purchased the suit from an over-the-road
trucker.... The element of larceny at issue in this case was whether the
defendant took the suit from the cleaners; there was no discussion of
his intent. The same analysis is applicable to the *Rosewall* and
*Girdler* cases; the defendant's intent was not an issue in these cases
either. *See Rosewall,* 239 N.W.2d at 174 ("Defendants here challenge
only the 'taking' element of the larceny charge."); *Girdler,* 251 Iowa
at 872-73, 102 N.W.2d at 879 (discussing sufficiency of the evidence to
prove the defendant, an escapee from prison, knew that another escapee
had stolen the vehicle in which the defendant was apprehended; the
defendant's intent was not mentioned as being in dispute). Finally, we
also think the *Everett* case is not helpful. In that case, the
defendant was accused of taking a vehicle from a used car lot. \... The
defendant claimed he had borrowed the vehicle from a bartender with whom
he was acquainted\.... Although the court discusses the sufficiency of
the evidence with respect to the defendant's "intent to steal" the
vehicle, ... it is apparent from the discussion of the evidence that the
real dispute was whether he took the vehicle from the used car lot or
legitimately borrowed it from a friend. Thus, the court did not really
focus on the precise issue that confronts us in the present case,
namely, where there is an admitted taking, is that sufficient, standing
alone, to support an inference of an intent to permanently deprive the
owner of his vehicle.

Because the *Brainard* and *Henning* cases are more on point factually
and because the courts in those cases focused on the evidence necessary
to support a finding of intent, we conclude the principles applied in
*Brainard* and *Henning* should govern our analysis here. Accordingly,
the mere fact that Schminkey took the pickup without the owner's consent
does not give rise to an inference that he intended to permanently
deprive the owner of the vehicle.

In our search for other facts or circumstances that might reveal
Schminkey's intent in taking the pickup, we find none indicating that he
intended to do anything more than temporarily use the vehicle to go home
or to another bar. Because Schminkey wrecked the pickup before he could
dispose of it, we do not have the typical inferences that can be drawn
from a defendant's actions subsequent to the taking. *Compare Slay,* 241
So.2d at 364 (holding the evidence was insufficient to prove that the
defendant had an intent to permanently deprive the owner of his car,
stating "the extent of damage to the car was of no probative value on
the issue of specific intent, since its wrecking was not purposeful"),
*with People v. Graham,* 27 Ill.App.3d 408, 327 N.E.2d 261, 264 (1975)
(finding evidence of intent to permanently deprive owner of vehicle
sufficient where defendant had changed the license plates on the car);
*State v. Keeler,* 238 Kan. 356, 710 P.2d 1279, 1283 (1985) (holding
evidence sufficient to prove intent to permanently deprive owner of car
where defendant used the vehicle for several days and then abandoned
it); *State v. Winkelmann,* 761 S.W.2d 702, 708 (Mo.Ct.App.1988)
(finding sufficient evidence of an intent to permanently deprive owner
of her car where the defendant intentionally drove the car into a brick
wall, inflicting severe damage to the vehicle). Furthermore, the record
contains no admissions by the defendant or statements from other
witnesses that would indicate Schminkey's purpose in taking the vehicle.
Under these circumstances, we conclude the record does not show a
factual basis for Schminkey's guilty plea to the charge of theft of a
motor vehicle....

There may be additional facts and circumstances that do not appear in
the minutes of testimony that would support an inference that the
defendant intended to permanently deprive the pickup's owner of his
vehicle. Therefore, we vacate the sentence entered on the theft charge
and remand for further proceedings at which time the State may
supplement the record to establish a factual basis for the crime of
theft of a motor vehicle. If a factual basis is not shown, the
defendant's plea must be set aside....

CARTER, Justice (dissenting):

... The record made before the district court during the guilty-plea
proceeding adequately demonstrated a factual basis for the charge of
theft of a motor vehicle. The minutes of testimony indicated that (1)
the owner of a 1978 brown and tan Chevrolet pickup truck would testify
that the vehicle was taken without permission on the evening of May 17,
1997; and (2) a Benton County deputy sheriff would testify that he was
close enough to a fatal collision involving the stolen pickup to hear
the sound of the impact and moments later arrived at the crash scene to
find defendant sitting crossways, by himself, in the front seat of the
missing pickup....

As a general proposition in prosecutions charging theft, possession of
property recently taken without permission establishes a prima facie
case that a theft has been perpetrated by the possessor of the missing
property. *See State v. Brightman,* 252 Iowa 1278, 1284, 110 N.W.2d 315,
316-18 (1961). This court has consistently applied this rule in cases
involving prosecutions for theft of a motor vehicle....

A helpful illustration of the application of this principle in a vehicle
theft situation similar to the present case is found in *Everett.*
There, the evidence showed that a motor vehicle had been left on the lot
of a used car dealer at the close of business on October 18, 1965. On
that evening, that vehicle was observed being driven on the streets of
Cedar Rapids and later parked behind a tavern in Cedar Rapids. Still
later in the evening, defendant was apprehended while driving the
vehicle. Defendant was convicted at trial of larceny of a motor vehicle.
On appeal the presumption of guilt to which I have referred was utilized
as the basis for upholding the conviction notwithstanding defendant's
testimony that he had only borrowed the car.

The majority attempts to distinguish these cases on the basis that the
intent to keep the property was not made an issue on those appeals. This
overlooks the fact that the inference of guilt applied therein
encompassed *all* elements of the offense of larceny of a motor vehicle.
This was expressly recognized in *Rosewall* in which this court states:

Under our holding in *Everett* the admitted possession by defendants of
the recently stolen motorcycle creates an inference barring a motion for
directed verdict. The inference is not limited to any particular element
of larceny. When it arises guilt of the crime of larceny is inferred.

*Rosewall,* 239 N.W.2d at 174. The elements of the former statutory
crime of larceny of a motor vehicle are sufficiently similar to the
present statutory crime of theft that the principle established in the
cases under discussion should be applied in the same manner\....

I would hold that the showing of factual basis in the present case was
adequate and proceed to consider the other issues raised on appeal.

McGIVERIN, C.J., and HARRIS, and LARSON, JJ. join this dissent.

 

 

 

State v. Morris

 

Iowa Supreme Court

677 N.W.2d 787 (2004)

PER CURIAM.

Defendant, Willis Elbert Morris, appeals from judgment and sentence
convicting him of second-degree theft as a habitual offender in
violation of Iowa Code sections 714.2(2), 902.8, and 902.9(3) (2001).
The alleged theft involved a motor vehicle. He contends that the State
failed to produce sufficient evidence that he intended to permanently
deprive the owner of possession of the motor vehicle, an essential
element of theft involving a motor vehicle. The court of appeals agreed
with that contention and reversed defendant's conviction for theft.
After reviewing the record and considering the arguments presented, we
affirm the decision of the court of appeals. The judgment of the
district court is reversed and remanded.

On October 6, 2001, at 4:30 a.m., Brian Gonzales started the engine on
his truck parked on the street in front of his home. He intended to let
it warm up before driving to work. Gonzales reentered his home leaving
the engine running. Shortly thereafter, he heard a "revving" of the
truck's engine, looked outside, and saw someone driving his truck away.

\'Gonzales called Waterloo police and reported the taking of the
vehicle. Officer Aaron McClelland arrived at the scene and took the
necessary information from Gonzales, including a description of the
truck. The officer then put out an "attempt to locate" call to Waterloo
patrol officers for the location of a brown Ford Ranger pickup truck.

Approximately thirty minutes later, McClelland came upon the missing
truck about five miles from Gonzales's residence. The truck was being
driven in the opposite direction from that of the officer's vehicle.
McClelland turned his police vehicle around and gave pursuit. The person
driving Gonzales's truck stopped the vehicle, got out, and fled on foot
toward nearby houses. Officer McClelland radioed for backup and a K-9
unit responded. One of the dogs alerted police to the presence of a
person hiding on a porch of a house. McClelland identified this person
as the man who had fled from the truck. That person was ultimately
determined to be defendant, Willis -Elbert Morris.

Defendant was arrested and charged with second-degree theft pursuant to
Iowa Code section 714.2(2) (the motor vehicle version), a class "D"
felony. He was also charged as a habitual offender, pursuant to Iowa
Code section 902.8. The second-degree theft charge was submitted to the
jury along with the lesser-included offense of operating a motor vehicle
without the owner's consent in violation of Iowa Code section 714.7. The
jury found defendant guilty of second-degree theft. He ultimately
stipulated to the prior offenses on which the habitual-offender
sentencing enhancement was based.

The court of appeals, relying on our decision in *State v. Schminkey,*
597 N.W.2d 785 (Iowa 1999), concluded that the mere fact that defendant
took Gonzales's pickup truck without consent of the owner did not give
rise to an inference that he intended to permanently deprive the owner
of the vehicle. The court further concluded that the evidence, viewed in
its entirety, was insufficient to permit a finding of the requisite
intent beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with the court of appeals'
reading of *Schminkey* and its application to the present facts.

Although apprehension of the suspect within a short time of the taking
of the vehicle does not defeat the possibility that there was an intent
to permanently deprive the owner of the property at the time of the
taking, it is a circumstance that severely limits the circumstantial
evidence from which that intent can be inferred. The State urges that
the circumstances under which the defendant abandoned the vehicle, i.e.,
stopping it and running away, are indicative of the requisite intent. We
disagree. Abandoning the vehicle and fleeing upon observing the presence
of police was an act that would ordinarily assure that the truck would
be returned to its owner. We affirm the decision of the court of appeals
holding that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for
second-degree theft.

The court of appeals simply remanded the case for further proceedings
not inconsistent with its opinion. We believe a more specific remand
mandate is warranted. The offense of operating a motor vehicle without
the owner's consent in violation of Iowa Code section 714.7 was
submitted to the jury as a lesser-included offense. The jury did not
reach a verdict on that offense because it found that the State had
established all elements of the greater offense. In so doing, the jury
necessarily found that the State had established all elements of the
included offense. In such instances, we have approved entering an
amended judgment of conviction with respect to the lesser-included
offense. *State v. Pace,* 602 N.W.2d 764, 774 (Iowa 1999).... We order
that this be done following remand in the present case. Defendant shall
then be resentenced according to law....

CARTER, Justice (concurring specially).

Although I am troubled with the decision of the court in *State v.
Schminkey,* 597 N.W.2d 785 (Iowa 1999), for the reasons set forth in my
dissent in that case I do not agree that that decision only applies to
guilty pleas, as the dissent in the present case suggests.

*Schminkey* involved the taking of an *Alford* plea in which the
defendant refused to admit guilt. When this occurs, the court, before
accepting the plea, must determine whether the evidence available to the
State would be sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict at trial. That is
the same analysis that must be undertaken in ruling on a motion for
judgment of acquittal. For this reason, *Schminkey* is valid authority
for the issue presently before the court.

I believe *Schminkey* failed to recognize the strength of the inference
that arises from taking an automobile without the owner's consent. An
individual's intent is synonymous with what he wants to do. What he
wants to do is usually motivated by and derived from the actor's own
best interests. It is in the best interests of one taking another's
automobile without permission that the vehicle not be returned to the
owner because this may aid in the identification of the perpetrator.

Notwithstanding my conclusions in this regard, I concur in the result
because I am unable to find that the totality of the evidence in the
present case, including the presumption to which I refer, is sufficient
to sustain a verdict of guilty on the greater charge. The defendant
should be declared guilty of the lesser-included offense.

LARSON, Justice (dissenting).

I dissent because the plurality fails to recognize and apply the
well-established principle that a defendant's possession of recently
stolen property creates an inference that the defendant stole it. In
concluding that proof of intent was not established in this case, the
plurality expressly relies on *State v. Schminkey,* 597 N.W.2d 785 (Iowa
1999), stating, "[\[]{.underline}w\]e agree with the court of appeals'
reading of *Schminkey* and its application to the present facts."

Even if the holding in *Schminkey,* was correct, I disagree with the
plurality's reliance on it in this case. Both *Schminkey* and the
present case involve the sufficiency of evidence on the element of
intent to deprive the owner of possession of a vehicle. With that,
however, the similarity ends. *Schminkey* was a guilty-plea case, while
the present case was tried to a jury. In a guilty-plea case, the State
may not rely on inferences to establish a factual basis. In contrast, a
jury-tried case is one in which inferences are standard stock-in-trade.
*See County Court of Ulster County, New York v. Allen,* 442 U.S. 140
(1979).

Inferences and presumptions are a staple of our adversary system of
fact- finding. It is often necessary for the trier of fact to determine
the existence of an element of the crime --- that is, an "ultimate" or
"elemental" fact --- from the existence of one or more "evidentiary" or
"basic" facts.

*Id.* at 156. The Supreme Court has further said that:

The most common evidentiary device is the entirely permissive inference
or presumption, which allows --- but does not require --- the trier of
fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the
basic one and that places no burden of any kind on the defendant. In
that situation the basic fact may constitute prima facie evidence of the
elemental fact. *When reviewing this type of device, the Court has
required the party challenging it to demonstrate its invalidity as
applied to him.*

... The facts presented at trial are briefly stated in the plurality
opinion. It is undisputed that Morris took the truck, at about 4:30
a.m., without the owner's consent. The owner immediately called the
police who soon located the vehicle and began to give chase. When the
police stopped the vehicle, Morris fled on foot. These facts are clearly
sufficient to give rise to an inference of guilt, including the element
of intent....

The plurality points to facts it contends militate against proof of an
intent to deprive the owner of possession. These facts include the
distance Morris traveled with the truck (approximately five miles)
before he was apprehended and the time he had the truck (approximately
thirty minutes). These facts are not necessarily helpful to Morris's
case, however; his relatively short time of possession might well have
been viewed by the jury to be the result of speedy police work --- not
evidence that he lacked the intent to keep it. In any event, that was a
question for the jury. While the facts relied on by Morris may affect
the strength of the inference, they do not preclude, as a matter of law,
an inference of intent. There is clearly a "rational way the \[jury\]
could make the connection permitted by the inference" under the *Allen*
test.

I believe the plurality erred in relying on *Schminkey,* in refusing to
recognize the inference of intent, and in failing to conclude that
sufficient evidence supports the conviction. I would vacate the decision
of the court of appeals and affirm the judgment of the district court.

Notes and Questions

 

*Schminkey* and *Morris* provide examples of an offense that requires
specific intent: the defendant must not only possess general intent
(i.e., intent to do the conduct of driving another's vehicle) but also
intend to achieve some harmful result or consequence defined in the
statute, such as depriving another of their property. Compare this to
the mens rea requirements for passive child abuse cases described in
Sargent. In those cases, the defendant must intend his conduct and be
criminally negligent about the risk of some consequence---harm to a
child. In specific intent offenses, by contrast, the defendant must
intend his conduct and intend some result. Both are combinations are
ways designed to ensure that only blameworthy people doing intentional
conduct are held criminally liable. If the specific intent requirement
were removed from this offense, can you think of a scenario in which a
morally blameless person might be eligible for punishment?

For some offenses, specific intent serves not simply to ensure that a
person is blameworthy but to identify those who are more blameworthy
than other offenders. That is, specific intent is one tool for *grading*
offenses---for defining relatively *more* wrongful conduct compared to
other, lesser (but still criminal) conduct. Assault statutes provide a
common example.

A standard definition of assault is something like "striking another in
a manner likely to cause injury"---a general intent offense. But a
graver assault offense carrying a harsher punishment might add a
specific intent requirement: "striking another with the intent to kill
or cause serious injury." You see the specific intent requirement
serving a similar function for the offenses at issue in *Schminkey* and
*Morris*. Auto theft is more serious than the crime of "joyriding"
because the thief specifically intends to permanently deprive the owner
of the vehicle. The joyrider intends to do so only for a while.

In the abstract, it might seem difficult to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt (absent a confession) what was in someone's head---what they knew
and intended. But as Henry David Thoreau said, "Some circumstantial
evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk." (That
was back in the days in which unscrupulous dairy farmers might try to
sell large vats of milk diluted with river water.) Often, it is quite
easy to infer a person's intent from their conduct and circumstances, no
matter their denial. How hard was it for the prosecution in *Schminkey*
or *Morris* to prove that each defendant intended his conduct of driving
the vehicle? The harder question in these two cases---as you can see in
the dissents---is drawing an inference about the driver's specific
intent to deprive another of their property. Notice that part of the
decisions do is not only specify that the prosecution must prove the
defendant's specific intent, but also what evidence is sufficient to do
that---or what conduct in what circumstances permit juries reasonably to
conclude that the actor had the requisite intent.

Notes on Common Law Mens Rea

 

As a basic, common law definition, one acts with "general intent" by
acting knowingly or intentionally doing a particular act that is
prohibited by the statute\--although one need not know that the act is
*prohibited*. By contrast, one acts with "specific intent" when, in
addition to acting knowingly, one desires the specific outcome or result
of the act. Thus, \"specific intent crimes\" require both general intent
and specific intent. For example, it is a crime to possess cocaine
(general intent) with intent to distribute it (specific intent). We can
see, then, that for specific intent crimes, prosecutors bear an
additional burden of proving the defendant intended their actions to
result in the specified crime. (We will soon see that, in jurisdictions
that follow the common law, the distinction between general intent and
specific intent matters in cases in which a defendant argues that he is
not guilty because he made a mistake---or held a mistaken belief---about
some fact or circumstance relevant to the charged crime. Under some
state criminal codes, the distinction also matters when defendants
present evidence that they were too intoxicated to have the requisite
intent.)

The easy specific intent offenses to identify are those statutes that
includes phrases like \"with intent to permanently deprive\" an owner of
property, or \"with intent to distribute\" an illicit drug.
Occasionally, however, the specific intent requirement is less explicit
in the statute\'s language yet courts have concluded that the offense
nonetheless requires specific intent. One example is the federal
false-statments statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1001: \"whoever \... knowingly and
willfully \... makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent
statement or representation\" shall be punished. Federal courts
interpret section 1001 to require specific intent to deceive. See, e.g.,
United States v. Godwin, 566 F.2d 975 (5th Cir. 1978).

Some crimes require one act merely recklessly or negligently rather than
intentionally. Such statutes, however, nonetheless have *implicit*
general intent requirements, in the sense that one must do the *conduct*
intentionally, but also in reckless or negligent manner. That, one must
do an act intentionally and be reckless or negligent as to risk of harm
one creates by acting in that manner. For example: "one who drives a
motor vehicle recklessly on a public road" implicitly requires that one
drive the vehicle intentionally and do so in a reckless manner\--say, at
an excessive speed, thus disregarding the risks created by speeding.
This just states the intuitive point---one that rarely is disputed, or
even mentioned, in criminal litigation---that, in order to "act
recklessly," one must also (or first) be acting intentionally.

Finally, there is subset of criminal offenses described as "strict
liability" crimes, meaning one can be liable without having any mens rea
at all---no general intent, recklessness, or negligence. As we will see,
strict liability crimes divide into two rough categories: so-called
"regulatory" offenses that tend to carry modest penalties, and a smaller
group of more serious offenses that carry more serious punishments.
Statutory rape---having sexual intercourse with a person under the age
of consent---is the classic example of this latter kind of a strict
liability crime. One is guilty of statutory rape even if one did not
intend to have sex with an underage person, or reasonably (but
mistakenly) believed that the person was not underage. Note, however,
that even in this strict liability offense---and most others described
as 'strict liability'---part of the offense implicitly requires
*intentional* conduct. To be guilty, one must *intentionally* have sex
with another. \"Strict liability'\"really describes only the requirement
that the other person be underage. (Granted, it's hard to imagine how
someone might unknowingly or unintentionally have sex, but that just
means 'unintentional sex' never occurs in real life; the crime
nonetheless implicitly requires intentional conduct.)

 

 

 

Notes on intoxication and intent

 

What happens when an actor is too intoxicated to be meaningfully aware
of his actions or to *intend* his conduct? The question is difficult and
arises often. The law varies among U.S. jurisdictions. The Model Penal
Code addresses this issue [MPC §
2.08](https://plus.lexis.com/api/permalink/47b38987-1bfd-4ab1-8a7c-6f61a7f9d92e/?context=1530671).
[New York Penal Code §
15.25](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/15.25) is an
example of a statute that adopts the core of MPC 2.08 in somewhat
different wording: 

§ 15.25 Effect of intoxication upon liability.

Intoxication is not, as such, a defense to a criminal charge; but in\
any prosecution for an offense, evidence of intoxication of the\
defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to
negative an element of the crime charged.

Section 2.08 has been less influential with state legislatures than
other MPC provisions. Many provisions in Pennsylvania\'s criminal code
are drawn from the Model Penal Code, but not the rule on intoxication:

[18 Pa. C.S. §
308](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=3&sctn=8&subsctn=0).
 Intoxication or drugged condition.

Neither voluntary intoxication nor voluntary drugged condition is a
defense to a criminal charge, nor may evidence of such conditions be
introduced to negative the element of intent of the offense, except that
evidence of such intoxication or drugged condition of the defendant may
be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to reduce murder
from a higher degree to a lower degree of murder.

Notice the specification of *voluntary* intoxication. Many jurisdictions
allow drug or alcohol intoxication to negative a general or specific
intent if the defendant had been involuntarily (unknowingly, perhaps by
another\'s deception) intoxication. See [Kan. Stat.
21-5205](https://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch21/021_052_0005.html):

\(a\) The fact that a person charged with a crime was in an intoxicated
condition at the time the alleged crime was committed is a defense only
if such condition was involuntarily produced and rendered such person
substantially incapable of knowing or understanding the wrongfulness of
such person\'s conduct and of conforming such person\'s conduct to the
requirements of law.

MPC 2.08(4) provides an \"affirmative defense\" (meaning the defendant
has the burden of proof) for \"intoxication that (a) is not self-induced
or (b) is pathological.\" Cases of defendants succeeding with a defense
of involuntary intoxication are hard to find. Merely being an alcoholic
who is severely addicted to alcohol is not recognized as involuntary
intoxication. Cf. [Powell v.
Texas](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/514/), 392 U.S.
514 (1968).

Most states  continue to follow some version of common law rules on this
point. There are basically two approaches. Perhaps the traditional
common law approach, still the law in some states, is that evidence of
intoxication is not relevant on the issue of whether a defendant
possessed \"general intent,\" but that intoxication evidence *is*
permitted on the issue of whether he had \"specific intent\"\--that is,
intoxication can negative specific intent. See second part of Kan. Stat.
21-5205:

\(b\) An act committed while in a state of voluntary intoxication is not
less criminal by reason thereof, but when a particular intent or other
state of mind is a necessary element to constitute a particular crime,
the fact of intoxication may be taken into consideration in determining
such intent or state of mind.

A good number of states, however, reject the latter half of that
formulation and dictate that intoxication is relevant neither for
questions of general intent nor of specific intent.

For a more thorough survey on this point, see, e.g., *Modern status of
the rules as to voluntary intoxication as defense to criminal charge*,
[8 A.L.R.3d

MPC and state rules on mistakes

provides the following rules regarding the relevance of mistakes to
culpability and criminal liability:

**(1) ** Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact or law is a defense
if:

**(a) ** the ignorance or mistake negatives the purpose, knowledge,
belief, recklessness or negligence required to establish a material
element of the offense; or

**(b) ** the law provides that the state of mind established by such
ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense.

**(2) ** Although ignorance or mistake would otherwise afford a defense
to the offense charged, the defense is not available if the defendant
would be guilty of another offense had the situation been as he
supposed. In such case, however, the ignorance or mistake of the
defendant shall reduce the grade and degree of the offense of which he
may be convicted to those of the offense of which he would be guilty had
the situation been as he supposed.

**(3) ** A belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is
a defense to a prosecution for that offense based upon such conduct
when:

**(a) ** the statute or other enactment defining the offense is not
known to the actor and has not been published or otherwise reasonably
made available prior to the conduct alleged; or

**(b) ** he acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of
the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in
(i) a statute or other enactment; (ii) a judicial decision, opinion or
judgment; (iii) an administrative order or grant of permission; or (iv)
an official interpretation of the public officer or body charged by law
with responsibility for the interpretation, administration or
enforcement of the law defining the offense.

Ignorance or mistake.

Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact, for which there is
reasonable explanation or excuse, is a defense if:

\(1\)  the ignorance or mistake negatives the intent, knowledge, belief,
recklessness, or negligence required to establish a material element of
the offense; or

\(2\)  the law provides that the state of mind established by such

United States v. Oglivie

 

United States Army Court of Military Review\
29 M.J. 1069 (1990)

Foreman, Senior Judge: \
A military judge sitting as a special court-martial convicted the
appellant, in accordance with his plea of guilty, of altering a public
record in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10
U.S.C. § 934 (1982) \[hereinafter UCMJ\]. Contrary to his pleas, the
military judge also convicted the appellant of signing a false official
statement (two specifications), wrongful appropriation of a copy of a
divorce decree, and bigamy, in violation of Articles 107, 121 and 134,
UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 907, 921 and 934 (1982). His approved sentence
provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for three months, and
reduction to Private E1. \
The appellant married his first wife, Amparo, in December 1986, while
stationed in Panama. In January 1987, the appellant was reassigned from
Panama to Germany, but his wife remained in Panama. While in Germany,
the appellant did not know Amparo's address or telephone number, but
sent letters to a friend, who passed them on to her. The appellant
returned from Germany in March 1988 and was reassigned to Fort Sill,
Oklahoma. In August 1988, the appellant sent his wife a money order with
his telephone number written on it. The appellant filed for divorce in
Oklahoma and sent a copy of the petition to a friend's post office box
in Panama for delivery to his wife. In September or October 1988, Amparo
called the appellant from Panama and informed him that she had filed for
divorce in Panama, that there was "nothing between the two of us" and
that he "didn't have to worry about her anymore." The appellant
testified that he thought he was divorced at that point. In November
1988, the Red Cross notified the appellant that Amparo had been
hospitalized. The Red Cross referred to Amparo as his "ex-wife." On 9
November 1988, the appellant requested that his basic allowance for
quarters (BAQ) at the "with dependents" rate be terminated because he
was divorced. The finance clerk told him that she could not stop the BAQ
without a divorce decree. Since the appellant did not have a copy of a
divorce decree, he took another sergeant's divorce decree, made a copy
of it, inserted his name and Amparo's in the text (but neglected to
change the caption) and attached it to his request to terminate his BAQ.
In December 1988, the appellant married Jackeline, and requested that
his BAQ at the "with dependents" rate be reinstated. \
The appellant was charged with making two false official statements to
officials of the Fort Sill finance office, first that he was divorced
from Amparo (Specification 1 of Charge II) and second that he was
married to Jackeline (Specification 2 of Charge II). He contends that
the evidence was insufficient to prove both specifications because he
honestly believed that he was divorced from Amparo. \
This court specified the following issues: (1) whether creation of an
altered copy of a public record without altering the original
constitutes the offense of altering a public record, and (2) whether the
appellant's plea of guilty to altering a public record was provident to
the offense charged or any lesser included offense. \
I. False Official Statements \
Making a false official statement in violation of UCMJ, Article 107, 10
U.S.C. § 907 (1982), is a specific intent crime. An honest mistake of
fact regarding the truth of the statement made is a defense. United
States v. Rowan, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 430, 16 C.M.R. 4 (C.M.A. 1954); Manual for
Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, Rule for Courts-Martial 916(j)
\[hereinafter M.C.M., 1984 and R.C.M.\]; M.C.M., Part IV, para. 31c(5).
The evidence establishes that Amparo told the appellant she had filed
for divorce, that the appellant received correspondence from the Red
Cross referring to Amparo as his "ex-wife," and that he attempted to
terminate his entitlement to BAQ, on the ground that he was divorced. He
then participated in a marriage ceremony and received a marriage
certificate indicating that he was married to Jackeline. Based upon the
entire record, we find that the defense of an honest mistake of fact was
raised and not overcome by the government's evidence. R.C.M. 916(b).
Accordingly, we find that the evidence is insufficient to prove
appellant's guilt of making false official statements (Charge II and its
two specifications). \
II. Bigamy \
Bigamy is a general intent crime. To constitute a defense to bigamy, a
mistake of fact must be both honest and reasonable. M.C.M., 1984, Part
IV, para. 65c. While the appellant may have honestly believed that he
was divorced from Amparo, we find that he did not take the steps which a
reasonable man would have taken to determine the validity of his honest
belief. United States v. McCluskey, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 545, 20 C.M.R. 261
(C.M.A. 1955). He was not reasonable in assuming that he was divorced.
See United States v. Bateman, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 88, 23 C.M.R. 312 (C.M.A.
1957) (knowledge that wife intended to proceed with divorce proceedings
insufficient); United States v. Avery, 9 C.M.R. 648 (A.F.B.R. 1953)
(reliance on attorney\'s prediction that divorce would occur on a given
date not reasonable). Accordingly, we find that the evidence is
sufficient to prove bigamy. \
III. Altering a Public Record \
The offense of altering a public record in violation of UCMJ, Article
134, is based on 18 U.S.C. § 2071. The offense is committed by altering,
concealing, removing, mutilating, obliterating, destroying, or taking a
public record with the intent to do any of the foregoing. M.C.M., 1984,
Part IV, para. 99b. A public record is defined as including "records,
reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public
offices or agencies, setting forth the activities of the office or
agency, or matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which
there was a duty to report." M.C.M., 1984, Part IV, para. 99c....\
In the case before us the appellant created and altered an unofficial,
unauthenticated photocopy of a public record, but did not disturb the
integrity of the public record itself. We hold that the unofficial,
unauthenticated photocopy altered by the appellant was not a public
record. \
... While intentional introduction of the altered unauthenticated
photocopy into government channels may have violated another
proscription, e.g., UCMJ, Article 132 or 18 U.S.C. § 1001, it did not
constitute the crime of altering a public record in violation of UCMJ,
Article 134, or any lesser included offense. Accordingly, we hold that
the appellant's plea of guilty to altering a public record in violation
of UCMJ, Article 134 was improvident. \
The findings of guilty of Charge II and its two Specifications (false
official statements), and Specification 2 of Charge IV (altering a
public record) are set aside. Charge II and its two Specifications, and
Specification 2 of Charge IV are dismissed. The remaining findings of
guilty are affirmed. The sentence is set aside. A rehearing on the

United States v. Binegar

 

United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\
55 M.J. 1 (2000)

Judge SULLIVAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\
In March of 1997, appellant was tried by a general court-martial
composed of officer members at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts.
Contrary to his pleas, he was found guilty of four specifications of
stealing contact lenses which were military property of the United
States, and one specification of conspiring to steal those contact
lenses, in violation of Articles 121 and 81, Uniform Code of Military
Justice, 10 USC §§ 921 and 881, respectively. On March 28, 1997, he was
sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, 3 months of hard labor without
confinement, and forfeiture of \$ 300 pay per month for 3 months. The
convening authority approved this sentence on July 24, 1997, and the
Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on November 1, 1999, in an
unpublished opinion....\
Evidence was admitted in this case that shows that in September 1995,
appellant began work in the Medical Logistics Office at Hanscom Air
Force Base, Massachusetts. One of his duties was to order contact lenses
for servicemembers who brought a prescription from the base Optometry
Clinic to the Medical Logistics Office. Personnel who needed contact
lenses to perform their duties or for a medical condition were entitled
to receive them free of charge. Other personnel had to obtain contact
lenses off-base and pay for the lenses themselves.\
It was also shown that Air Force regulations governed the process of
ordering contact lenses at the Medical Logistics Office. The Optometry
Clinic was required to produce a purchase letter for all prescriptions
sent to the Medical Logistics Office. If the lenses were required \"for
the performance of duties,\" the Logistics Office was to code the
purchase order with a \"fund cite\" indicating the servicemember\'s
section. If, however, the lenses were required for a medical condition,
the Optometry Clinic fund cite was used. Once a month, the office
generated reports of how many lenses had been billed to each account.\
Evidence was further admitted that appellant\'s supervisors neglected to
follow these procedures with any regularity. The Optometry Clinic rarely
generated purchases letters, and Medical Logistics would order contact
lenses without them. One of appellant\'s supervisors, Senior Master
Sergeant (SMSgt) Kremer, testified that he believed at one time that all
clinic personnel were entitled to free contact lenses, even if not
medically required. In fact, SMSgt Kremer instructed appellant to sign a
purchase order for him to get free lenses soon after appellant began
work at Medical Logistics. SMSgt Kremer did not provide appellant with a
purchase letter or prescription for his lenses, although he testified
that he later discussed with appellant a clarified command policy
requiring a medical reason for contact lenses with some exceptions.\
Finally, evidence was admitted that appellant continued to order contact
lenses, filing the appropriate purchase orders and keeping his paperwork
in order. Appellant\'s supervisors never reviewed the monthly reports to
determine whether lenses were being billed to the proper accounts.
Moreover, appellant\'s supervisors failed to provide appellant with
formal training or specific guidelines for any of these procedures. The
next supervisor of the office, Staff Sergeant (SSgt) Smith, even
authorized appellant to sign purchase orders for him between October
1995 to January 1996. Appellant signed SSgt Smith\'s name to over 90% of
the purchase orders filed between September 1995 and March 1996. Neither
SSgt Smith nor his predecessor, SMSgt Kremer, ever told appellant that
he was doing his job improperly. Furthermore, appellant had public
conversations concerning his conduct in ordering contact lenses with the
servicemembers for whom he ordered those lenses....\
The military judge gave the following instructions in this case:

As to the various charges, the evidence has raised the issue of
ignorance or mistake on the part of the accused concerning whether he
was under the mistaken belief that he was authorized to order contact
lenses at government expense with a purchase order from military members
who provided him only a prescription from the Optometry Clinic. *If the
accused mistakenly believed that he was authorized to order contact
lenses at government expense with a purchase order for military members
who provided him only a prescription from the Optometry Clinic, he is
not guilty of the offense of larceny or conspiracy to commit larceny if
his ignorance or belief was reasonable. To be reasonable, the ignorance
or belief must have been based upon information or lack of it which
would indicate to a reasonable person that he was authorized to order
contacts at government expense. Additionally, the ignorance or mistake
cannot be based on a negligent failure to discover the true facts.*\
In resolving this issue, you should consider the accused\'s age,
education, and rank along with the testimony of Senior Master Sergeant
Kremer, Staff Sergeant Smith, Captain Bleuel, Staff Sergeant Allen,
Staff Sergeant Smith, Airman Basic Maurice, Special Agent Collazo, Staff
Sergeant McGee, Senior Airman Antoine, Airman First Class Marsh, Senior
Airman Vallee, and Mr. Yenger.\
The burden is on the prosecution to establish the accused\'s guilt. If
you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the
charged offenses the accused was not ignorant of a fact or under the
mistaken belief that he was authorized to order contact lenses at
government expense with a purchase order for military members who
provided him only a prescription from the Optometry Clinic, the defense
of ignorance or mistake of fact does not exist. Even if you conclude
that the accused was ignorant of the fact or the mistaken belief that he
was authorized to order contact lenses at government expense or the
purchase order for military members who provided him only a prescription
from the Optometry Clinic, *if you are convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that at the time of the charged offenses the accused\'s ignorance
or mistake was unreasonable, the defense of ignorance or mistake of fact
does not exist.*

(R. 381-82) (emphasis added).\
Appellant contends that the military judge at his court-martial erred in
refusing to give an \"honest\" mistake-of-fact instruction as requested
by the defense. We note that the military judge made this ruling because
he concluded appellant\'s purported mistake of fact went to a matter
unrelated to the specific intent required for conviction of larceny
under Article 121, UCMJ. Accordingly, citing Paragraph 5-11 of the
Military Judges\' Benchbook (Dept. of the Army Pamphlet 27-9 (Sept. 30,
1996)), he concluded that an honest and reasonable mistake as to such a
fact was required and so instructed the members. The Court of Criminal
Appeals likewise concluded that this was a correct instruction because
the purported mistake \"concerned the wrongfulness of the appellant\'s
taking, whether he had permission to order the contacts \[, and\] this
is a general intent element and appellant\'s belief must have been
reasonable under all the circumstances.\" Unpub. op. at 5. We disagree.
United States v. Turner, 27 M.J. at 220 (holding that honest mistake of
fact as to a superior\'s permission to dispose of government property is
a defense to larceny)....\
Article 121, UCMJ, states:

\(a\) Any person subject to this chapter who wrongfully takes, obtains,
or withholds, by any means, from the possession of the owner or of any
other person any money, personal property, or article of value of any
kind\--\
(1) *with intent permanently to deprive or defraud another person of the
use and benefit of property or to appropriate it to his own use or the
use of any person other than the owner, steals* that property and is
guilty of larceny;

(Emphasis added.) We have long recognized that this codal article
requires the Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an
accused had a specific intent to steal. Moreover, it also has long been
recognized that an honest mistake of fact as to a soldier\'s entitlement
or authorization to take property is a defense to a charge of larceny
under this codal provision. See United States v. Sicley, 6 U.S.C.M.A.
402, 410-13, 20 C.M.R. 118, 126-29 (1955); United States v. Rowan, 4
U.S.C.M.A. 430, 16 C.M.R. 4 (1954). We have recently reiterated this
holding. United States v. Gillenwater, 43 M.J. 10 (1995)....\
The military judge in appellant\'s case did not acknowledge this case
law .... Moreover, he did not explain why appellant\'s averred mistake
as to his authority to issue contact lenses did not undermine a specific
intent on his part to permanently deprive the Government of this
property. Contra United States v. Turner, supra. His exclusive reliance
on the relevance of the mistaken fact to a so-called general \"intent\"
element was misplaced. The pertinent inquiry is whether the purported
mistake concerns a fact which would preclude the existence of the
required specific intent....\
This Court\'s opinions in Peterson (mistake as to consent in
housebreaking case) and Garcia (mistake as to sexual consent in indecent
assault case) also do not support the trial judge\'s ruling. They
addressed mistakes as to facts which were completely unrelated to the
specific intents at issue in those non-larceny cases. Moreover, those
decisions do not suggest in any way that a military superior\'s
permission to his subordinate to dispose of government property to other
servicemembers is that type of fact, i.e., one unrelated to a specific
intent of that subordinate to steal from the Government.... Accordingly,
we must find legal error.\
Turning to the question of harmless error, we conclude that appellant
was materially prejudiced by the \"honest and reasonable\"
mistake-of-fact instruction actually given in this case. Article 59(a),
UCMJ, 10 USC § 859(a). First of all, the prosecution-requested
instruction placed a lesser burden on the Government to prove
appellant\'s guilt because it could now secure his conviction by
disproving either the honesty or the reasonableness of appellant\'s
mistake. Moreover, trial counsel exploited the erroneous instruction by
calling this government option to the attention of the members during
deliberations. He said:

And that leads us to the defense of mistake of fact for all of these
contacts. *As the judge instructed you, there must be two different
things here*: One is, was this mistake honest; namely, did Airman
Binegar really have this mistake? *And, number two is: Was this mistake
reasonable? Because regardless of whether Airman Binegar thought this,
if it was not reasonable, the defense still does not exis*t. The
government has disproven this mistake beyond a reasonable doubt.

(R. 391) (emphasis added). Finally, the Government presented a
substantial case on the unreasonableness of appellant\'s conduct in this
case (R. 390-91), creating a reasonable possibility that the members
resolved this case against appellant on this basis....\
The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is
reversed. The findings of guilty and the sentence are set aside. The
record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air
Force. A rehearing may be ordered.\
CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (dissenting):\
I would hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion by
instructing the members that appellant\'s mistake related to the general
intent element of \"wrongful taking\" and that the mistake had to be
both \"honest and reasonable.\" Giving tens of free contact lenses to
individuals not entitled to government contact lenses was neither honest
nor reasonable. If the judge did err, any error was harmless because the
record does not support the conclusion that appellant ever made an
honest mistake of fact\....

1 Some evidence was admitted that several purchase orders contained the
first names of the soldiers receiving the lenses, but spelled backwards.
(R. 88) The importance of that fact was disputed.

 

 

 

Notes on mistakes of fact

 

Can you now clearly articulate the traditional rules regarding mistakes
of fact for \"general intent\" and \"specific intent\" offenses? Can you
describe precisely what element of each criminal offense\--conduct,
result, circumstances\--that each defendant was mistaken about? Do the
doctrines for factual mistakes do a good job of allowing criminal
liability for blameworthy people and barring criminal liability for the
nonblameworthy?

Notice the function of mistake-of-fact rules. These rules fill a gap (or
resolve issues) left open by the fact that neither \"general intent\"
nor \"specific intent\" doctrines generally say anything about mental
state that, in order to be guilty, one must have with respect to the
factual circumstances surrounding crimes. General intent relates mostly
to conduct, specific intent to results.

 

 

 

4.3

Mistakes of Law

 

We have seen that a mistake is a defense to a crime if it negates the
mens rea required by statute. As the Model Penal Code points out,
whether we use the language of mistake makes no difference: A mistake
provides a defense if and only if it negates the mens rea required by
statute.

The challenge sometimes is determining what mens rea is required by
statute, and then whether the defendant\'s mistake demonstrates that he
did not have that mens rea.

In the next materials, we examine whether and how ignorance or mistakes
about the law, rather than some fact, affects liability.

 

 

 

 

Rules on relevance of mistakes of law

 

The Model Penal Code\'s provision regarding the relevance of mistakes
about (or ignorance of) the criminal law is fairly representative of the
rule in most jurisdictions. Recall [18 Pa. C.S. §
302](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=3&sctn=2&subsctn=0)(h),
noted earlier in the chapter, which codified [MPC
2.02(9)](https://plus.lexis.com/api/permalink/ed4934c5-3560-45fb-88d2-34e9726257db/?context=1530671)
verbatim: 

**Culpability as to illegality of conduct**.\--Neither knowledge nor
recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense
or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining
the elements of an offense is an element of such offense, unless the
definition of the offense or this title so provides.

 

 

 

People v. Marrero

 

### *People v. Marrero*

New York Court of Appeals

69 N.Y.2d 382 (1987)

 

BELLACOSA, J.

The defense of mistake of law (Penal Law § 15.20) is not available to a
Federal corrections officer arrested in a Manhattan social club for
possession of a loaded .38 caliber automatic pistol who claimed he
mistakenly believed he was entitled, pursuant to the interplay of CPL
2.10, 1.20 and Penal Law § 265.20, to carry a handgun without a permit
as a peace officer.

On the trial of the case, the court rejected the defendant\'s argument
that his personal misunderstanding of the statutory definition of a
peace officer is enough to excuse him from criminal liability under New
York\'s mistake of law statute. The court refused to charge the jury on
this issue and defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a
weapon in the third degree. We affirm the Appellate Division order
upholding the conviction.

\[CPL 1.20 provided an exception to the certain firearm possession laws
for peace officers and section 2.10 defined peace officer to include
\"correction officers of any state correction facility or of any penal
correctional institution.\"\]

Defendant was a Federal corrections officer in Danbury, Connecticut, and
asserted that status at the time of his arrest in 1977. He claimed at
trial that there were various interpretations of fellow officers and
teachers, as well as the peace officer statute itself, upon which he
relied for his mistaken belief that he could carry a weapon with legal
impunity.

The starting point for our analysis is the New York mistake statute as
an outgrowth of the dogmatic common-law maxim that ignorance of the law
is no excuse. The central issue is whether defendant\'s personal
misreading or misunderstanding of a statute may excuse criminal conduct
in the circumstances of this case**\[ ... \]**

The revisors of New York\'s Penal Law intended no fundamental departure
from this common-law rule in Penal Law § 15.20, which provides in
pertinent part:

§ 15.20. *Effect of ignorance or mistake upon liability.*

\(2\) \"A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct
because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does
not, as a matter of law, constitute an offense, unless such mistaken
belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in

\(a\) a statute or other enactment \* \* \*

\(d\) an interpretation of the statute or law relating to the offense,
officially made or issued by a public servant, agency, or body legally
charged or empowered with the responsibility  or privilege of
administering, enforcing or interpreting such statute or law.\"

This section was added to the Penal Law as part of the wholesale
revision of the Penal Law in 1965. When this provision was first
proposed, commentators viewed the new language as codifying \"the
established common law maxim on mistake of law, while at the same time
recognizing a defense when the erroneous belief is founded upon an
\'official statement of the law\'*\" \[citation omitted\].*

The defendant claims as a first prong of his defense that he is entitled
to raise the defense of mistake of law under section 15.20(2)(a) because
his mistaken belief that his conduct was legal was founded upon an
official statement of the law contained in the statute itself. Defendant
argues that his mistaken interpretation of the statute was reasonable in
view of the alleged ambiguous wording of the peace officer exemption
statute, and that his \"reasonable\" interpretation of an \"official
statement\" is enough to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (2)(a).
**\[ ... \]**

The prosecution further counters defendant\'s argument by asserting that
one cannot claim the protection of mistake of law under section
15.20(2)(a) simply by misconstruing the meaning of a statute but must
instead establish that the statute relied on actually permitted the
conduct in question and was only later found to be erroneous. To
buttress that argument, the People analogize New York\'s official
statement defense to the approach taken by the Model Penal Code (MPC).
Section 2.04 of the MPC provides: 

Section 2.04. *Ignorance or Mistake.*

\"(3) A belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a
defense to a prosecution for that offense based upon such conduct when
\* \* \*

\(b\) he acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the
law, *afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous,* contained in

\(i\) a statute or other enactment\" (emphasis added).

It was early recognized that the "official statement" mistake of law
defense was a statutory protection against prosecution based on reliance
of a statute that did in fact authorize certain conduct. "It seems
obvious that society must rely on some statement of the law, and that
conduct which is in fact 'authorized'  \...  should not be subsequently
condemned. The threat of punishment under these circumstances can have
no deterrent effect unless the actor doubts the validity of the official
pronouncement --- a questioning of authority that is itself
undesirable." Note, 64 Colum. L. Rev. at 1486 (emphasis added). While
providing a narrow escape hatch, the idea was simultaneously to
encourage the public to read and rely on official statements of the law,
not to have individuals conveniently and personally question the
validity and interpretation of the law and act on that basis. If later
the statute was invalidated, one who mistakenly acted in reliance on the
authorizing statute would be relieved of criminal liability. That makes
sense and is fair. To go further does not make sense and would create a
legal chaos\....

Although the drafters of the New York statute did not adopt the precise
language of the Model Penal Code provision with the emphasized clause,
it is evident and has long been believed that the Legislature intended
the New York statute to be similarly construed. In fact, the legislative
history of section 15.20 is replete with references to the influence of
the Model Penal Code provision.

In the case before us, the underlying statute never, *in
fact*,* authorized* the defendant\'s conduct; the defendant only thought
that the statutory exemptions permitted his conduct when, in fact, the
primary statute clearly forbade his conduct. Moreover, by adjudication
of the final court to speak on the subject in this very case, it turned
out that even the exemption statute did not permit this defendant to
possess the weapon. It would be ironic at best and an odd perversion at
worst for this court now to declare that the same defendant is
nevertheless free of criminal responsibility.

It must also be emphasized that, while our construction of Penal Law §
15.20 provides for narrow application of the mistake of law defense, it
does not, as the dissenters contend, \"rule out *any* defense based on
mistake of law.\" To the contrary, mistake of law is a viable exemption
in those instances where an individual demonstrates an effort to learn
what the law is, relies on the validity of that law and, later, it is
determined that there was a *mistake in the law itself.*

The modern availability of this defense is based on the theory that
where the government has affirmatively, albeit unintentionally, misled
an individual as to what may or may not be legally permissible conduct,
the individual should not be punished as a result. This is salutary and
enlightened and should be firmly supported in appropriate cases.
However, it also follows that where, as here, the government is not
responsible for the error (for there is none except in the defendant\'s
own mind), mistake of law should not be available as an excuse. 

We recognize that some legal scholars urge that the mistake of law
defense should be available more broadly where a defendant misinterprets
a potentially ambiguous statute not previously clarified by judicial
decision and reasonably believes in good faith that the acts were legal.
Professor Perkins, a leading supporter of this view, has said: "\[if\]
the meaning of a statute is not clear, and has not been judicially
determined, one who has acted 'in good faith' should not be held guilty
of crime if his conduct would have been proper had the statute meant
what he 'reasonably believed' it to mean, even if the court should
decide later that the proper construction is otherwise." Perkins,
Ignorance and Mistake in Criminal Law, 88 U. Pa. L. Rev. 35, 45. In
support of this conclusion Professor Perkins cites two cases: State v.
Cutter, 36 N.J.L. 125, and Burns v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 611, 61 S.W.2d
512. In both these cases mistake of law was viewed as a valid defense to
offense where a specific intent ... was an element of the crime charged.
In *Burns*, the court recognized mistake of law as a defense to
extortion. The statute defining "extortion" made the "willful" doing of
the prohibited act an essential ingredient of the offense. The court,
holding that mistake of law is a defense only where the mistake negates
the specific intent required for conviction, borrowed language from the
*Cutter* case: "In State v. Cutter \...  the court said: 'The argument
goes upon the legal maxim *ignorantia legis neminem excusat*. But this
rule, in its application to the law of crimes, is subject \... to
certain important exceptions. Where the act done is malum in se, or
where the law which has been infringed was settled and plain, the maxim,
in its rigor, will be applied; but where the law is not settled, or is
obscure, and where the guilty intention, being a necessary constituent
of the particular offence, is dependent on a knowledge of the law, this
rule, if enforced, would be misapplied.' " 61 S.W.2d, at 513 (emphasis
added). Thus, while Professor Perkins states that the defense should be
available in cases where the defendant claims mistaken reliance on an
ambiguous statute, the cases he cites recognize the defense only where
the law was ambiguous and the ignorance or mistake of law negated the
requisite intent. In this case, the forbidden act of possessing a weapon
is clear and unambiguous, and only by the interplay of a double
exemption does defendant seek to escape criminal responsibility, i.e.,
the peace officer statute and the mistake statute.

We conclude that the better and correctly construed view is that the
defense should not be recognized, except where specific intent is an
element of the offense or where the misrelied-upon law has later been
properly adjudicated as wrong. Any broader view fosters lawlessness. It
has been said in support of our preferred view in relation to other
available procedural protections:

\"A statute\...which is so indefinite that it \'either forbids or
requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common
intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application, violates the first essential of due process of law\' and is
unconstitutional. If the court feels that a statute is sufficiently
definite to meet this test, it is hard to see why a defense of mistake
of law is needed. Such a statute could hardly mislead the defendant into
believing that his acts were not criminal, if they do in fact come under
its ban \... \[I\]f the defense of mistake of law based on
indefiniteness is raised, the court is\...going to require proof\...that
the act was sufficiently definite to guide the conduct of reasonable
men. Thus, the need for such a defense is largely supplied by the
constitutional guarantee\"

Strong public policy reasons underlie the legislative mandate and intent
which we perceive in rejecting the defendant\'s construction of New
York\'s mistake of law defense statute. If defendant\'s argument were
accepted, the exception would swallow the rule. Mistakes about the law
would be encouraged, rather than respect for and adherence to law. There
would be an infinite number of mistake of law defenses which could be
devised from a good-faith, perhaps reasonable but mistaken,
interpretation of criminal statutes, many of which are concededly
complex. Even more troublesome are the opportunities for wrongminded
individuals to contrive in bad faith solely to get an exculpatory notion
before the jury. These are not *in terrorem* arguments disrespectful of
appropriate adjudicative procedures; rather, they are the realistic and
practical consequences were the dissenters\' views to prevail. Our
holding comports with a statutory scheme which was not designed to allow
false and diversionary stratagems to be provided for many more cases
than the statutes contemplated. This would not serve the ends of justice
but rather would serve game playing and evasion from properly imposed
criminal responsibility.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

 

HANCOCK, JR., J. (dissenting).

The basic difference which divides the court may be simply put. Suppose
the case of a man who has committed an act which is criminal not because
it is inherently wrong or immoral but solely because it violates a
criminal statute. He has committed the act in complete good faith under
the mistaken but entirely reasonable assumption that the act does not
constitute an offense because it is permitted by the wording of the
statute. Does the law require that this man be punished? The majority
says that it does and holds that (1) Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) must be
construed so that the man is precluded from offering a defense based on
his mistake of law and (2) such construction is compelled by prevailing
considerations of public policy and criminal jurisprudence. We take
issue with the majority on both propositions.

 It is difficult to imagine a case more squarely within the wording of
Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) or one more fitted to what appears clearly to be
the intended purpose of the statute than the one before us. For this
reason it is helpful to discuss the statute and its apparent intended
effect in the light of what defendant contends was his mistaken belief
founded on an official statement of the law contained in a statute.

The majority ... has accepted the People\'s argument that to have a
defense under Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) \"a defendant must show that the
statute *permitted his conduct,* not merely that he believed it did.\"
Here, of course, the defendant cannot show that the statute permitted
his conduct. To the contrary, the question has now been decided by the
Appellate Division and it is settled that defendant was not exempt under
Penal Law § 265.20(a)(1)(a). Therefore, the argument goes, defendant can
have no mistake of law defense. While conceding that reliance on a
statutory provision which is later found to be invalid would constitute
a mistake of law defense the People\'s flat position is that \"one\'s
mistaken reading of a statute, no matter how reasonable or well
intentioned, is not a defense.\"

\[T\]he majority bases its decision on an analogous provision in the
Model Penal Code and concludes that despite its totally different
wording and meaning Penal Law § 15.20(2)(a) should be read as if it were
Model Penal Code § 2.04(3)(b)(i). But New York, in revising the Penal
Law, did not adopt the Model Penal Code. As in New Jersey, which
generally adopted the Model Penal Code but added one section which is
substantially more liberal, New York followed parts of the Model Penal
Code provisions and rejected others. In *People v. Goetz,* we said that
the Legislature\'s rejection of the verbatim provisions of the Model
Penal Code was crucial in determining its intent in drafting the
statute. The significance of the alterations here can be no different.

Any fair reading of the majority opinion, we submit, demonstrates that
the decision to reject a mistake of law defense is based on
considerations of public policy and on the conviction that such a
defense would be bad, rather than on an analysis of CPL 15.20(2)(a)
under the usual principles of statutory construction The majority warns,
for example, that if the defense were permitted \"the exception would
swallow the rule\"; that \"\[m\]istakes about the law would be
encouraged\"; that an \"infinite number of mistake of law defenses\...
could be devised\"; and that \"wrongminded individuals \[could\]
contrive in bad faith solely to get an exculpatory notion before the
jury.\"

These considerations, like the People\'s argument that the mistake of
law defense \"would encourage ignorance where knowledge is socially
desired\" (Respondent\'s Brief, at 28.), are the very considerations
which have been consistently offered as justifications for the maxim
*\"ignorantia legis\".* That these justifications are unabashedly
utilitarian cannot be questioned. It could not be put more candidly than
by Justice Holmes in defending the common-law maxim more than 100 years
ago: *\"Public policy sacrifices the individual to the general good
\...* It is no doubt true that there are many cases in which the
criminal could not have known that he was breaking the law, but to admit
the excuse at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker
has determined to make men know and obey, and *justice to the individual
is rightly outweighed by the larger interests on the other side of the
scales\"* (Holmes, The Common Law, at 48 \[1881\]; emphasis added).
Regardless of one\'s attitude toward the acceptability of these views in
the 1980s, the fact remains that the Legislature in abandoning the
strict *\"ignorantia legis\"* maxim must be deemed to have rejected
them.

We believe that the concerns expressed by the majority are matters which
properly should be and have been addressed by the Legislature. We note
only our conviction that a statute which recognizes a defense based on a
man\'s good-faith mistaken belief founded on a well-grounded
interpretation of an official statement of the law contained in a
statute is a just law. The law embodies the ideal of contemporary
criminal jurisprudence \"that punishment should be conditioned on a
showing of subjective moral blameworthiness."

 

 

 

State v. Mason

 

Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas

663 S.W.3d 621 (2022)

McClure, J.

In 2018, Appellant Crystal Mason was convicted of illegal voting, then a
second-degree felony, and sentenced to five years' confinement. The
Second Court of Appeals affirmed her conviction. *Mason v. State*, 598
S.W.3d 755, 763 (Tex. App. 2020). Appellant filed a petition for
discretionary review with this Court, arguing that the court of appeals
erred in ... in holding that her unawareness about her ineligibility to
vote "was irrelevant to her prosecution" ... \[We hold that\] the court
below erred by failing to require proof that the Appellant had actual
knowledge that it was a crime for her to vote while on supervised
release. We remand to that court to evaluate the sufficiency of the
evidence under the correct interpretation of the statute.

In the 2004 general election, Appellant filled out an Affidavit of
Provisional Voter form. The form included the following affirmation: the
voter had not been finally convicted of a felony, or if a felon, had
completed all punishment including any term of incarceration, parole,
supervision, or period of probation, or had been pardoned. The form
served as an application for voter registration in Tarrant County from
that point forward. Tarrant County accepted the form and registered
Appellant as a voter. Appellant voted in the 2008 elections in Tarrant
County.

In 2011, Appellant pled guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to
defraud the United States arising out of a phony tax preparation scheme.
The federal court sentenced her to five years' imprisonment and three
years of supervision after her release .... Her conviction became final
by 2013.

In accordance with requirements of the National Voting Rights Act,
Tarrant County received a report which included Appellant's felony
conviction and sentence. In 2013, the Tarrant County Elections
Administration (TCEA) mailed a Notice of Examination to Appellant's
listed home address. The notice stated that TCEA was examining her
registration based on information about her felony conviction and
informing her that if she did not reply within 30 days with adequate
information to show her qualification to stay registered, her
registration would be cancelled. *See* Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 16.033.

When the 30-day deadline passed without response, TCEA mailed a notice
to the same address stating that Appellant's voter registration had been
cancelled and that she was entitled to a hearing and appeal. When both
notices were mailed, Appellant was in federal custody serving her
sentence, and she testified at trial that she did not receive the
notices. Neither notice was returned to TCEA, however. TCEA cancelled
Mason's registration.

After finishing her prison term and while on supervised release,
Appellant reported to her probation officer that she would resume living
at the same address as before. At trial, a supervisor from the probation
office testified that no one from that office told Appellant she was
ineligible to vote while on supervised release.

On November 8, 2016, Appellant went to her designated polling place for
the general election. The election worker checking the registration roll
could not find her name, so workers offered to let her complete a
provisional ballot, which she agreed to do. She completed the affidavit,
just as she had done in 2004, and electronically cast her provisional
ballot. The election worker who had checked the registration roll
reported a concern about Appellant's provisional ballot to the election
judge for Appellant's precinct, who happened to be Mason's neighbor. The
election judge then reported the concern to the district attorney's
office. Appellant's ballot was not counted in the election.

Appellant was ultimately indicted for voting in an election in which she
knew she was not eligible to vote. The indictment alleged that she had
not been fully discharged from her sentence for the felony conviction.
She waived a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial. Her defensive
theories at trial were that she did not read the admonishments in the
Affidavit of Provisional Voter, the government never told her she could
not vote as a convicted felon, and she would not have voted had she
known she was ineligible....

On direct appeal, Appellant argued ... the evidence was both legally and
factually insufficient to support the guilt finding ....

The Second Court of Appeals overruled Appellant's grounds and held,
relevant to this proceeding, that the evidence was sufficient to support
her conviction. *Mason*, 598 S.W.3d at 781, 789. The court below said
that the State needed only to prove that Appellant voted while knowing
of the existence of the condition that made her ineligible---in this
case, that she was on federal supervised release after imprisonment for
a final felony conviction. *Id.* at 770....

Appellant filed \[a petition\] for discretionary review, arguing that
the court of appeals' holding conflicts with our recent decision in
*Delay v. State*, in which we held that when the *mens rea* element of
an Election Code offense is "knowingly," the accused must "actually
realize" the conduct violated the Election Code. 465 S.W. 3d 232, 251-52
(Tex. Crim. App. 2014). Specifically, this Court held that "knowingly"
undertaking an act in violation of the Election Code means the actor
must be aware not only of the circumstances that render conduct unlawful
but also of the fact that the conduct violates the Election Code. *Id.*
at 250. Appellant argues that she explicitly testified she did not know
she was ineligible to vote due to being on federal supervised release
and that the State's only evidence regarding Appellant's knowledge was
based on speculation she had read the provisional ballot affidavit.

During the pendency of this \[petition\], the Texas Legislature added
new language to the Illegal Voting statute .... Election Code section
64.012(c) now specifies that a person "may not be convicted solely upon
the fact that the person signed a provisional ballot affidavit under
Section 63.011 unless corroborated by other evidence that the person
knowingly committed the offense." *Id.* The amendment clarifies that a
provisional ballot affidavit alone is insufficient evidence that the
person knowingly committed the offense. Corroboration by other evidence
is required for conviction.

Furthermore, the Legislature included a savings clause in S.B. 1 that
applied the legislation to anyone who committed an offense before, on,
or after the effective date of the Act, except for final convictions.
*Id.* at § 9.04. The law's effective date was December 2, 2021.
Appellant's \[petition\] of her criminal conviction for illegal voting
was pending at that time, so her conviction was not final....\
ANALYSIS\
In Appellant's first ground, she argues that the court of appeals erred
by concluding that her knowledge of her ineligibility to vote was
irrelevant to her prosecution. We agree that this Court's precedent and
the legislative history support the conclusion that actual knowledge of
one's ineligibility is an element of the offense of illegal voting.

1.  *[Applying the Mens Rea of Knowingly]{.underline}*

The Court's decision in *Delay v. State* provides guidance here. 465
S.W. 3d 232. In that case, former Republican Congressman Tom Delay was
convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to launder money based on a
series of political contributions from corporations that allegedly
violated section 253.003(a) of the Election Code. *Id.* at 238-39. This
section criminalizes "knowingly mak\[ing\] a political contribution in
violation of \[the Election Code\]." Tex. Elec. Code. Ann. § 253.003(a).
The question in *Delay* was "whether the word 'knowingly' in the statute
modified merely the making of a campaign contribution, or whether it
also modified the statutory circumstance that the contribution was made
'in violation of' the Election Code." *Delay*, 465 S.W.3d at 250. In
other words, we were required to construe "how far down the sentence the
word 'knowingly' is intended to travel\[.\]" *Id.* (citing *Liparota v.
United States*, 471 U.S. 419, 424 n.7 (1985)).

In doing so, this Court recognized that when construing a penal
provision that appears outside the Penal Code, any ambiguity should be
resolved in favor of the accused. *Delay*, 465 S.W.3d at 251 n. 69 ("We
are mindful of the proposition that criminal statutes outside the penal
code must be construed strictly, with any doubt resolved in favor of the
accused."); *see also State v. Rhine*, 297 S.W.3d 301, 309 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2009) ("Although the common-law rule that a penal statute is to be
strictly enforced does not apply to the Penal Code \[citing Tex. Penal
Code § 1.05(a)\], criminal statutes outside the penal code must be
construed strictly, with any doubt resolved in favor of the accused.").

We applied this doctrine, adapted from the Rule of Lenity, to the facts
in *Delay*. We held that "knowingly" undertaking an action "in violation
of the Election Code" means "that the actor \[is\] aware, not just of
the particular circumstances that render his otherwise-innocuous conduct
unlawful, but also of the fact that undertaking the conduct under those
circumstances in fact constitutes a 'violation of' the Election Code."
*Delay*, 465 S.W.3d at 250. Stated another way, a statutory requirement
that an individual "knowingly" commit an offense under the Election Code
requires the State to prove both knowledge of underlying facts giving
rise to a circumstance and an "actual\[\] realiz\[ation\]" that the
specified circumstance renders the conduct unlawful. *Id.* at 250, 252.

The court of appeals acknowledged *Delay* but held it was
distinguishable here because section 64.012(a)(1)'s knowledge
requirement clearly applied to the person's knowledge of the conduct,
whereas the statute under which Delay was convicted contained an
ambiguous knowledge requirement. *Mason*, 598 S.W.3d at 768, n.12. In
other words, the court below concluded that the Rule of Lenity does not
apply to Appellant because the statute in this instance is not
ambiguous. While we agree with the court below that the knowledge
requirement is not ambiguous, we disagree that *Delay* is not
applicable.

Under canons of statutory construction, a reviewing court is to construe
a statute according to its plain language unless the language is
ambiguous, or the interpretation would lead to absurd results that the
Legislature could not have intended. To do so, the reviewing court
focuses on the literal text of the statutory language in question,
reading it in context and construing it "according to the rules of
grammar and common usage." Tex. Gov't Code § 311.011(a). "Where the
statute is clear and unambiguous, the Legislature must be understood to
mean what it has expressed, and it is not for the courts to add or
subtract from such a statute." *Coit v. State*, 808 S.W.2d 473, 475
(Tex. Crim. App. 1991).

As discussed above, Delay was convicted of violating section 253.003(a)
of the Election Code, which says that a person may not knowingly make a
campaign contribution *that the person knows is in violation of the
Election Code*. In our analysis, we looked at the ambiguity in section
253.003(a) and determined that the statute required the person to know
the contribution violated the Election Code. *Delay*, 465 S.W.3d at 250.

Turning now to the statute for which Appellant was prosecuted, Texas
Election Code section 64.012(a), makes it an offense to "vote\[\] . . .
in an election *in which the person knows the person is not eligible to
vote*," where eligibility is established by section 11.001 of the
Election Code (emphasis added). To construe the statute to mean that a
person can be guilty even if she does *not* "know\[\] the person is not
eligible to vote" is to disregard the words the Legislature intended. It
turns the knowledge requirement into a sort of negligence scheme wherein
a person can be guilty because she fails to take reasonable care to
ensure that she is eligible to vote. A plain reading of the language in
section 64.012(a)(1) requires *knowledge* that a defendant herself is
ineligible to vote, not simple negligence. The statute does not allow a
court to presume knowledge of ineligibility based solely on a
provisional ballot affidavit. This reading is consistent not only with
*Delay* but also with the Legislature's intent.\
In *Delay*, we interpreted the phrase "knowingly make a political
contribution in violation of this chapter" to mean that an actor must
knowingly make a political contribution while also knowing that the
contribution violates the Election Code. 465 S.W.3d at 250. Doing the
same in this case yields a result in which the phrase "knows the person
is not eligible to vote" means that Appellant was guilty if she knew she
was ineligible to vote in addition to knowing that she had not completed
her sentence.

The recent amendment to the Illegal Voting statute demonstrates that the
court of appeals' strict liability reading of the statute---that, to be
found guilty of this offense, an individual need not know that he or she
is ineligible to vote or that voting while being ineligible is a
crime---"would lead to absurd consequences that the Legislature could
not possibly have intended." *See Boykin v. State*, 818 S.W.2d 782, 785
(Tex. Crim. App. 1991). ... \[O\]n August 31, 2021, the Texas House of
Representatives passed House Resolution 123, directly addressing the
interpretation of section 64.012(a)(1). The ... \[legislative history
of\] House Resolution 123, along with the retroactive change to section
64.012, are persuasive authority that the court of appeals'
interpretation of section 64.012(a)(1)'s *mens rea* requirement was
incorrect.\
*[2. Proving Actual Knowledge of Ineligibility]{.underline}*

Now that we have recognized that section 64.012 requires individuals to
know they are ineligible to vote to be convicted of illegal voting, what
does it substantively mean to knowingly violate the Election Code? This
Court has consistently affirmed that where an offense criminalizes
otherwise innocuous conduct based on particular circumstances, "the
culpable mental state of 'knowingly' must apply to those surrounding
circumstances." *See McQueen v. State*, 781 S.W.2d 600, 603 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1989) (analyzing Tex. Penal Code § 31.07); *see also Dennis v.
State*, 647 S.W.2d 275, 280 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983) (holding that, for
the possession-of-stolen-property offense, the word 'knowingly,' when
used to describe the defendant's reception of property that has been
stolen, requires 'actual subjective knowledge, rather than knowledge
that would have indicated to a reasonably prudent man that the property
was stolen' because such actual knowledge is what makes unlawful the
otherwise innocent conduct of receiving property); *see also State v.
Ross*, 573 S.W.3d 817, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 2019) (analyzing Tex. Penal
Code Ann. § 42.01(a)(8)) (holding that, with respect to a statute that
prohibits intentionally or knowingly displaying a firearm in a manner
calculated to alarm, persuading a jury that the actor's display was
objectively alarming would not, by itself, be enough for a conviction);
*see also Jackson v. State*, 718 S.W.2d 724, 726 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)
(holding that, for the evading arrest offense, it is essential that a
defendant know the peace officer is attempting to arrest him).

Once again turning to *Delay*, we held that the State did not prove a
violation of section 253.003(a) because, although the contributing
corporations may have known that their contributions would be steered to
specific candidates, "nothing in the record shows that anyone associated
with the contributing corporations *actually realized* that to make a
political contribution under these circumstances would in fact violate .
. . the Texas Election Code." *Delay*, 465 S.W.3d at 252 (emphasis
added).

Applying this holding in *Delay* to Appellant's alleged offense of
illegal voting, the State was required to prove not only that Appellant
knew she was on supervised release but also that she "*actually
realized*" that "these circumstances . . . in fact" rendered her
ineligible to vote. *Id.* (emphasis added).

The Election Code requires actual knowledge of one's ineligibility to
vote. Because the court of appeals did not consider the evidence under
the proper interpretation of the statute, we vacate that portion of the
judgment of the court of appeals and remand the sufficiency ground to
that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\
CONCLUSION

... The court of appeals' sufficiency analysis relied on an erroneous
interpretation of the statute, as Appellant stated in ground one. As a
remedy, we remand ground one for additional proceedings consistent with
this opinion....

\[On remand, the Texas Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
conviction, concluding that the trial evidence was insufficient to
support a jury finding that Mason had actual knowledge of her
ineligibility to vote. See Mason v. State, 687 S.W.3d 772 (Tex. App.
Second Cir. 2024).\]

5 The Rule of Lenity is defined as "The judicial doctrine holding that a
court, in construing an ambiguous criminal statute that sets out
multiple or inconsistent punishments, should resolve the ambiguity in
favor of the more lenient punishment." *Rule of Lenity*, *Black's Law
Dictionary* (11th ed. 2019). In 2015, the Rule of Lenity was formally
codified to ensure that all criminal laws, if ambiguous, are read in
favor of the defendant. See Tex. Gov't Code § 311.035.

 

 

 

State v. Varszegi, 33 Conn. App. 368, 635 A.2d 816 (1993)

 

O\'CONNELL, J. The defendant was initially charged with larceny in the
first degree in violation of General Statutes §§ 53a-122 (a)(2) and
53a-119, and criminal coercion in violation of General Statutes § 53a-49
(a)(2). Following a jury trial, he was convicted of the lesser included
offense of larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes
§ 53a-124 and acquitted of the coercion charge. The defendant appeals
from his larceny conviction. The defendant claims that (1) there was
insufficient evidence to support the larceny conviction and (2) the
trial court\'s jury instruction violated his constitutional rights to
due process of law and a fair trial. We reverse.

 The jury could have reasonably found the following facts. The defendant
was the landlord of commercial property at 1372 Summer Street in
Stamford. One of the defendant\'s tenants was Executive Decisions
Support, Inc., a computer software company headed by Catherine Topp.
Topp, in her capacity as president of the company, personally signed the
lease with the defendant. The lease contained a default clause
authorizing the defendant to enter the tenant\'s premises, seize the
tenant\'s personal property and sell it as a way of recovering unpaid
rent or other charges. The defendant claimed Topp had failed to pay her
rent for March, April and May 1990.

 On Saturday May 5, 1990, the defendant entered Topp\'s office by
picking the lock. He proceeded to remove two of Topp\'s computers and
attached printers. On Monday May 7, 1990, Topp arrived at work and
noticed that the lock on her office door had been tampered with. Upon
entering and noticing her computers were missing, Topp called the
Stamford police. After the completion of an initial investigation at the
scene by Officer Frank Pica, Topp telephoned the defendant, who admitted
that he had taken her computers as a consequence of her failure to pay
three months' rent. Pica then took the phone from Topp and identified
himself. The defendant advised Pica that he was Topp\'s landlord and
expressed his belief that his actions were proper and legal. Upon
hearing this, Pica expressed doubt as to the lawfulness of the
defendant\'s conduct, at which point the defendant reiterated his belief
that his actions were in accordance with his lease.

At this point, Pica called his supervisor, Sergeant Ralph Geter. Geter
arrived shortly thereafter and telephoned the defendant, who again
identified himself as Topp\'s landlord and again admitted having taken
the computers in question. Geter informed the defendant that he had no
right under the law to confiscate Topp\'s computer equipment and that he
should make arrangements with Topp to return the goods. No such
arrangements were made and the defendant sold the computers on May 23,
1990.

On May 25, 1990, a detective contacted the defendant and inquired
whether they could meet to discuss the matter as part of his
investigation. As he had from the start, the defendant admitted during
this telephone conversation that he had taken and retained the computers
pursuant to his lease. On June 6, 1990, the defendant met with the
detective at the Stamford police station and was asked for a formal
statement. The defendant requested an attorney and the conversation
ended. The defendant was subsequently arrested on June 28, 1990.

The defendant first claims that the state did not prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he was guilty of larceny....

Larceny is defined in General Statutes § 53a-119 as follows: \"A person
commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to
appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes,
obtains or withholds such property from an owner\....\" This crime has
three elements and all three must be established beyond a reasonable
doubt. It must be shown that (1) there was an intent to do the act
complained of, (2) the act was done wrongfully, and (3) the act was
committed against an owner. This appeal focuses on the elements of
\"intent\" and \"wrongfully.\" Because larceny is a specific intent
crime, the state must show that the defendant acted with the subjective
desire or knowledge that his actions constituted stealing. A specific
\"intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to
himself . . . is an essential element of larceny . . . and as such must
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the state.\" (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) *State* v. *Fernandez*, 198 Conn. 1, 20, 501 A.2d 356
(1985).

\"The '*animus furandi*,' or intent to steal, is an essential element of
the crime of larceny at common law.\" 50 Am. Jur. 2d, Larceny § 35
(1970). Hornbook law articulates the same premise. \"Since the taking
must be with felonious intent . . . taking under a bona fide claim of
right, however unfounded, is not larceny\.... Although ignorance of the
law is, as a rule, no excuse, it is an excuse if it negatives the
existence of a specific intent. Therefore, even if the taker\'s claim of
right is based upon ignorance or mistake of law, it is sufficient to
negative a felonious intent. A fortiori, a mistake of fact, if it is the
basis of a bona fide claim of right, is sufficient.\" J. Miller,
Handbook of Criminal Law (1934) § 114 (a), p. 367; see also 2 W. LaFave
& A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) § 8.5 (a)....

Particularly apposite to the present case is the comment in American
Jurisprudence that, \"it is generally held that because of lack of a
felonious intent, one is not guilty of larceny who, in the honest belief
that he has the right to do so, openly and avowedly takes the property
of another without the latter\'s consent, as security for a debt bona
fide claimed to be due him by the owner, or even to apply or credit it
to the payment thereof.\" Id., 205-206.

\"A defendant who acts under the subjective belief that he or she has a
lawful claim on property lacks the required felonious intent to steal.
Such a defendant need not show his mistaken claim of right was
reasonable, since an unreasonable belief that he had a right to take
another\'s property will suffice so long as he can establish his claim
was made in good faith.\" 50 Am. Jur. 2d, Larceny § 41 (1993 Supp.),
relying on *People* v. *Romo*, 220 Cal. App. 3d 514 (1990).

Connecticut case law is consistent with other jurisdictions and the text
writers quoted herein. As far back as 1902, our Supreme Court recognized
that the mere taking of another\'s property was not sufficient to prove
larceny. The taking must be accompanied by a felonious intent to deprive
the owner of its use. If a person takes property in the honest, though
mistaken belief, that he has a right to do so, he has not committed
larceny. *State* v. *Main*, 75 Conn. 55, 57, 52 A. 257 (1902).

Our Supreme Court has also considered the scenario of a landlord who,
like the defendant in the present case, seizes his tenant\'s property as
security for a debt. *State* v. *Sawyer*, 95 Conn. 34, 35-36, 110 A. 461
(1920). In *Sawyer*, a landlady took possession of a tenant\'s handbag
on the ground that the tenant was liable to her for damage done to the
demised premises. The court held that the defendant had not committed a
larceny because she believed that her claim justified refusal to return
the handbag unless the tenant paid for the damage. Id., 38. The court
based its decision on the absence of felonious intent and the presence
of a color of right. The court held that \"one is not guilty of theft
without consciousness of the wholly unlawful and inexcusable nature of
his act. The grave character of the necessary intent makes that clear.
His belief in his right to take the thing involved, *even though a
mistaken belief, or one entertained upon insufficient grounds*, is
essentially inconsistent with the presence of an intent to steal, and
the terms \'colour of right or excuse\' obviously demand a construction
consonant with that point of view.\" (Emphasis added.) Id....

In the present case, the defendant claims that he did not possess the
specific felonious intent to commit larceny but rather acted in good
faith pursuant to a lease that gave him, as the landlord, authority to
enter the premises, impound the lessee\'s property, sell it and apply
the proceeds to the unpaid rent or other charges. The state claims that
it introduced evidence from which the jury could reasonably have
inferred that the defendant intended to steal the computer equipment.

We hold that there was insufficient evidence introduced at trial to
prove that the defendant knew that he had no right to take the lessee\'s
computers. During the initial phone conversation with Topp, the
defendant made no attempt to conceal either his identity or that he had
in fact taken the computers. The defendant emphatically stated during
this conversation that the default clause in the lease provided him with
the authority to impound her property based on her failure to pay the
three months' rent due. Moreover, the officers testifying at trial each
stated that the defendant never wavered from his contention that his
actions were lawful, even when faced with the threat of criminal
prosecution. The defendant\'s unfaltering and consistent statements to
all parties involved that he acted in good faith in seizing Topp\'s
computers were not contradicted by the testimony of any witness.

... The state contends ... that the defendant\'s weekend entry into
Topp\'s office by picking the lock and his subsequent impounding of the
computers without leaving a note was enough evidence from which the jury
could have reasonably found the requisite intent. Significantly, none of
the foregoing evidence contradicted the defendant\'s claim that he acted
in good faith in taking the computers based on the default clause in the
lease. In fact, the defendant testified that he entered the office on
the weekend so as to avoid an awkward confrontation. When asked by Topp
where the computers were on the following Monday, the defendant
concealed nothing. Notwithstanding the state\'s claim to the contrary,
the record is devoid of any evidence that the jury could have reasonably
relied upon in finding the defendant acted with the requisite
culpability. The state\'s bald and conclusory assertion that the jury
simply rejected the defendant\'s consistent claim that the rental
agreement served as justification for his action is not enough to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt the specific intent requirement for larceny.

Moreover, the state contends that even if the defendant believed in good
faith that he had the right to take his tenant\'s personal property to
secure overdue rent payments, once he was told by three members of the
police force that he was acting illegally, he could no longer reasonably
maintain an honest though mistaken belief that he was acting lawfully.
We do not agree. Police officers are not imbued with the authority or
prerogative to declare provisions of civil contracts void, thereby
converting good faith to a felonious intent....

We agree with the defendant that there was insufficient evidence to
support his conviction of larceny in the third degree. Because our
decision on the defendant\'s first claim is dispositive of the appeal,
we do not reach the defendant\'s second claim.

The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to
render judgment of not guilty of larceny in the third degree.

1 General Statutes § 53a-122 (a)(2) provides in relevant part: \"A
person is guilty of larceny in the first degree when he commits larceny
as defined in section 53a-119 and \... (2) the value of the property or
service exceeds ten thousand dollars\....

2 General Statutes § 53a-119 provides in relevant part: \"A person
commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to
appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes,
obtains or withholds property from an owner\....\"

3 General Statutes § 53a-124 provides in relevant part: \"A person is
guilty of larceny in the third degree when he commits larceny as defined
in section 53a-119 and \... (2) the value of the property or service
exceeds one thousand dollars\....\"

4 Paragraph twelve, section (b) of the defendant\'s lease reads as
follows: \"If Lessee defaults under this Lease, Lessor may without
further notice to the Lessee: (i) terminate this Lease; (ii) re-enter
and take possession of the Leased Premises, remove all persons and
property therefrom and disconnect any telephone lines installed for the
benefit of Lessee, all without being deemed to have committed any
trespass; (iii) impound Lessee\'s property and sell it at auction or
private sale, applying the proceeds thereof to any unpaid rent or other
charges, including costs of collection, and holding the Lessee
responsible for any deficiency; (iv) recover, in addition to any rent
and other charges already due and payable, all rent for the entire
unexpired balance of the Term of this Lease and all costs incurred by
Lessor to recover such sums from Lessee, including reasonable
attorney\'s fees. All rights and remedies of Lessor under this Lease
shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies
available at law or in equity.\" (Emphasis added.)

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

Given prosecutors\' wide discretion in deciding whether to charge a
suspect with a crime, was the prosecutor\'s decision to charge Marrero
an appropriate one? What reasons make it so (or justify declining to
charge)? What about the decision to charge Varszegi?

*Marrero* and *Varszegi* represent different kinds of mistakes of law.
*Marrero* is included in most Criminal Law casebooks as a classic
example of a mistake of *criminal *law. Mr. Varszegi made a mistake
based in civil law, i.e., property, contract, or landlord-tenant law.

*Varszegi* falls into a category of mistakes described as \"color of
right\" claims. Unlike mistakes of criminal law, claims that one has a
right to some property based on a mistaken about belief about rights of
ownership or possession are often successful, at least if the court is
sufficiently convinced that the defendant honestly believed he owned, or
had a right to, the disputed property. Is that a good idea? Why not tell
people like Varszegi, who believe they are entitled to such property, to
use legal processes to obtain the property or payment for an unpaid
debt? Should landlords who hold mistaken beliefs about the law and use
self-help to take a tenant\'s property as a means to collect a debt face
criminal liability?

Note that it didn\'t matter to the court that Varszegi was informed by
police officers that he had not legal entitlement to keep the tenant's
property. Should that matter? 

In light of both *Marrero *and *Varszegi*, the traditional principle
*ignorantia juris non excusat*\--ignorance of law is no excuse\--seems
an imprecise description of the law. Justice Brennan quoted the
commentary to Model Penal Code § 2.02 (Comment 131) to make this point
in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 615--16 (1971) (Brennan, J.,
concurring):

It should be noted that the general principle that ignorance or mistake
of law is no excuse is usually greatly overstated; it has no application
when the circumstances made material by the definition of the offense
include a legal element. So, for example, it is immaterial in theft,
when claim of right is adduced in defense, that the claim involves a
legal judgment as to the right of property. It is a defense because
knowledge that the property belongs to someone else is a material
element of the crime and such knowledge may involve matter of law as
well as fact\....  The law involved is not the law defining the offense;
it is some other legal rule that characterizes the attendant
circumstances that are material to the offense.

In other words, sometimes ignorance or a mistake of non-criminal law
*can be* an excuse\--or more precisely, it can defeat the prosecution\'s
proof of a required element of the offense. The traditional principle is
"overstated" if people wrongly interpret it to mean that mistakes of
*non-criminal* law are never an excuse. It is likewise overstated with
respect to mistake of *criminal *law when the criminal statute, such as
the illegal-voting offense in *Mason*, require proof of defendant\'s
knowledge of the criminal law (such as, in *Mason*, knowledge that one
has the status under the Election Code of an unqualified or ineligible
voter).

In light of Brennan\'s explanation and the differences in the legal
effect between mistakes of criminal law and non-criminal law that
*Marrero *and *Varszegi* represent, consider *State v. Woods*, 179 A. 1,
107 Vt. 354 (Vt. 1935). In that case, Ms. Woods was charged under
Vermont's so-called "Blanket Act," which punished an unmarried woman
found in bed with another woman\'s husband (or a man with another man's
wife) "under circumstances affording presumption of an illicit
intention." Ms. Woods had traveled with Leo Shufelt, the man with whom
she was eventually found, from Vermont to Reno, Nevada, where he
divorced his first wife and then married Ms. Woods. Unfortunately for
Ms. Woods, the divorce was ineffective as neither Shufelt nor his wife
was a Nevada resident. Thus, Ms. Woods believed, reasonably though
wrongly, that the man she was lying with was her own husband rather than
"another woman's husband." The Vermont Supreme Court, finding that
public policy against "attempted foreign divorces" would be eviscerated
by allowing claims of ignorance to provide a defense to this charge,
affirmed the conviction: "When it is proved that the parties were found
in bed together under circumstances affording a presumption of an
intention to commit the act charged in the indictment or information,
then the requirement of the statute is met and ignorance of the law
cannot be urged as a defense." 179 A. at 7, 107 Vt. At 357.

Consider first what kind of mistake Ms. Woods made. The court
characterized it as "ignorance of the law." But was it a mistake of
*criminal* law, or one of (non-criminal) divorce law? (Or perhaps was it
a mistake of fact?) Can you explain why that distinction would matter?
In light of *Marrero, Varszegi*, and Brennan\'s explanation in *Freed*,
was *Woods* correctly decided? Some courts in the same era disagreed,
holding that an honest and reasonable mistake of non-criminal law, such
as the law governing validity of out-of-state divorce decrees, provides
a defense. See, e.g., People v. Vogel, 46 Cal. 2d 798, 299 P.2d 850
(1956). In general, and outside the context of bigamy- and
adultery-related crimes prior to the late 20th century, the rule for
mistakes of non-criminal law is generally the same as for mistake of
fact: an honest mistake can negate specific intent; an honest and
reasonable mistake can negate a general intent offense.

Consider *Marrero *again. Mr. Marrero was charged under a statute that
prohibited the possession of a loaded firearm. His mistake was whether
he qualified under a statute that exempted "peace officers" from that
criminal prohibition. More specifically, he turned out to have been
mistaken about whether, as a federal corrections officer, he fit New
York's definition of a "peace officer." Do you agree that Mr. Marrero
made a \"mistake of *criminal* law\"?

The mistakes doctrine that *Varszegi *represents is a longstanding one
in common law jurisdictions. In *Regina v. David Smith*, 2 Q.B. 354
(1974) the defendant was charged under a statute that punished: "A
person who, without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property
belonging to another intending to destroy such property or being
reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged."
The defendant had damaged floor panels and floorboards that he had
installed in his rental unit in order to remove the stereo wires he had
placed behind them. Although the trial court informed the jury that the
defendant's (incorrect) belief that the flooring was his was not
relevant, the appellate court reversed: "\[i\]n our judgment no offence
is committed under this section if a person destroys or causes damage to
property belonging to another if he does so in the honest though
mistaken belief that the property is his own."

Model Penal Code

 

Commonwealth v. Camacho, 2019 MP 2 (N. Mariana Islands 2019), provides a
basic account of the motivation for the Model Penal Code and reform of
common law *mens rea* terms:

Prior to the MPC\'s implementation of mental states, \"\[t\]he common
law traditionally used a variety of overlapping and, frankly, confusing
phrases to describe culpable mental states---among them, specific
intent, general intent, presumed intent, willfulness, and malice.\"
Voisine v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2272, 2281 (2016). \"In 1970, the
*National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws* decried the
\'confused and inconsistent ad hoc approach\' of the federal courts\" to
mens rea.... The movement to redefine mens rea resulted in a
\"codification of workable principles for determining criminal
culpability,\" as well as \"a general rethinking of traditional mens rea
analysis.\" This new approach moved \"away from the traditional
dichotomy of intent and toward an alternative analysis of mens rea,\" as
exemplified in the American Law Institute\'s Model Penal Code. As a
result, \"\[t\]he MPC does not explicitly distinguish between general
and specific intent, but instead classifies crimes based on whether the
act is done . . . purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.\"
\[Citation omitted.\]

 

 

 

 

MPC culpability requirements

 

MPC § 2.02(2)(a)-(d) defines four distinct \'culpability requirements,\'
or mental states, that have been adopted in perhaps twenty or so state
criminal codes and have proven influential in others. Those \'kinds of
culpability\' are listed in hierarchy from most to least blameworthy or
serious: \'**purposely**,\' \'**knowingly**,\' \'**recklessly**,\' and
\'**negligently**.\' Section 2.02 (and the rest of the MPC) is available
on
[Lexis](https://plus.lexis.com/api/permalink/8fd79b2a-5ac4-481d-b89a-d6937c337bd7/?context=1530671),
[HeinOnline](https://heinonline-org.proxy01.its.virginia.edu/HOL/Index?index=ali/mpc&collection=ali),
and elsewhere. These provisions are widely quoted in case law. See, for
example, Commonwealth v. Camacho, 2019 MP 2, 15 & n.6 (N. Mariana
Islands 2019):

The MPC states that generally, \"a person is not guilty of an offense
unless he acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the
law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.\"
Model Penal Code § 2.02. It also provides detailed definitions as to
each level of
culpability.[^6^](#Xf64e50a497ab25d1d955f5375fe3998c44ea62f)

[^6 ^](#X7bd2895cb1f8ecf06ab4f3cbc965a7598c00f21) \[In MPC § 2.02,\]
purposely, knowingly, and recklessly are defined as follows:

\(a\) **Purposely**. A person acts purposely with respect to a material
element of an offense when:

\(i\) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result
thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature
or to cause such a result; and

\(ii\) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware
of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they
exist.

\(b\) **Knowingly**. A person acts knowingly with respect to a material
element of an offense when:

\(i\) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant
circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that
such circumstances exist; and

\(ii\) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that
it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a** **result.

\(c\) **Recklessly**. A person acts recklessly with respect to a
material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or
will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and
degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor\'s conduct
and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross
deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would
observe in the actor\'s situation.

For § 2.02 (2)(d) definition of **negligently**, see, e.g., Carrell v.
United States, 165 A.3d 314, 322 n.21(D.C. Ct. App. 2017):

\"A person acts **negligently** with respect to a material element of an
offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk
that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The
risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor\'s failure to
perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the
circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard
of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\'s
situation.\"

 

 

 

 

MPC rules of interpretation

 

In addition to providing definitions of four distinct mental states, the
MPC offers rules designed to help lawyers and judges (and, in theory,
ordinary people) interpret criminal statutes---specifically, rules to
determine which culpability term applies to each part of a criminal
statute. The most important of these rules are those in MPC § 2.02(3),
(4) & (9). Pennsylvania, for example, has adopted all three of these MPC
provisions in its state criminal code. MPC § 2.02(3), (4) & (9) are
identical to [18 Pa. C.S. §
302](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=3&sctn=2&subsctn=0)(c),
(d) & (h) reprinted here:

**\[3\] Culpability required unless otherwise provided**.---When the
culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is
not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.

**\[4\] Prescribed culpability requirement applies to all material
elements.\--**When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of
culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without
distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall
apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary
purpose plainly appears.

**\[9\] Culpability as to illegality of conduct**.\--Neither knowledge
nor recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an
offense or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law
determining the elements of an offense is an element of such offense,
unless the definition of the offense or this title so provides.

In addition, **MPC § 2.02(5)** confirms the fairly intuitive point that
anytime a statute specifies a less culpable state, that requirement may
be established by proof a greater (i.e., more culpable) mental state:
\"When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element
of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts
purposely, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts
purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an
element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely.\"

See also the interpretive rules in MPC § 2.02(6), (7) and (8), which
have been enacted as 18 Pa. C.S. § 302(f), [Del. Code Ann. tit.
11](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title11/c002/index.html), § 255, and 18
Pa. C.S. § 302(g), respectively:

**\[6\]** **Requirement of [intent]{.underline} satisfied if
[intent]{.underline} is conditional**.\--When a particular
[intent]{.underline} is an element of an offense, the element is
established although such [intent]{.underline} is conditional, unless
the condition negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the
law defining the offense. \[*Note: Pennsylvania, like a few other states
adopting MPC provisions, chose to use the word 'intent' instead of
'purpose,' although it gave 'intent' the same definition as the MPC
provides for 'purpose*.'\]

**\[7\] Knowledge of high probability**. When knowledge of the existence
of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is
established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence,
unless the person actually believes that it does not exist.

**\[8\]** **Requirement of willfulness satisfied by acting
knowingly**.\--A requirement that an offense be committed willfully is
satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material
elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements
appears.

 

 

 

MPC rules regarding causation of results

 

MPC § 2.03 provides guidance for applying statutes that require an
actor\'s conduct to cause some result (such as death, or property loss).
Pennsylvania enacted [MPC §
2.03](https://plus.lexis.com/api/permalink/827e0075-98cf-49bf-9453-c1dca87ac925/?context=1530671)
at [18 Pa. C.S. §
303](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=3&sctn=3&subsctn=0)
(again, except that it substituted the word \'intent\' where the MPC
uses \'purpose\'):

** Causal relationship between conduct and result.**

**(a)  General rule.\--**Conduct is the cause of a result when:

(1)  it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not
have occurred; and

(2)  the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any
additional causal requirements imposed by this title or by the law
defining the offense.

**(b)  Divergence between result designed or contemplated and actual
result.\--**When intentionally or knowingly causing a particular result
is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the
actual result is not within the intent or the contemplation of the actor
unless:

(1)  the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated as the
case may be, only in the respect that a different person or different
property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or
contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that
caused; or

(2)  the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that
designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in its
occurrence to have a bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity
of his offense.

**(c)  Divergence between probable and actual result.\--**When
recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an element of
an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not
within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the case of
negligence, of which he should be aware unless:

(1)  the actual result differs from the probable result only in the
respect that a different person or different property is injured or
affected or that the probable injury or harm would have been more
serious or more extensive than that caused; or

(2)  the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the
probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to
have a bearing on the liability of the actor or on the gravity of his
offense.

**(d)  Absolute liability.\--**When causing a particular result is a
material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed
by law, the element is not established unless the actual result is a
probable consequence of the conduct of the actor.

 

 

 

State v. Lozier (Ohio 2004)

 

101 Ohio St.3d 161, 803 N.E.2d 770 (2004)

 

[PFEIFER](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=h&pubNum=176284&cite=0257071501&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)),
J.

On February 14, 2001, the Holmes County Grand Jury indicted
defendant-appellee, Chad A. Lozier, for trafficking in drugs in
violation of \[Ohio Rev. Code §\] 2925.03(A). All ... counts against
appellee contained a specification that appellee sold drugs within the
vicinity of a school, which enhances the penalty under R.C.
2925.03(C)(5)(b). Appellee withdrew his initial plea of not guilty and
entered pleas of no contest to \[all\] counts.

 The sales at issue occurred at appellee's former home, which is located
approximately 745 feet from the Holmes County Job and Family Services
building. That building housed, on its third floor, a remedial education
program known as "Project Stay." The state stipulated that it had no
evidence that appellee knew of the existence of Project Stay and that
there was nothing to mark it or to identify it as a school to the
public.

 The trial court ruled that Project Stay was, in fact, a school. The
court also ruled that whether appellee knew that he was selling drugs in
the vicinity of the school was irrelevant, since the specification for
trafficking within the vicinity of a school is written in terms of
strict liability. Appellee was convicted on four counts of trafficking
with the sentence-enhancement specifications.

 Appellee appealed from his convictions to the Fifth District Court of
Appeals, arguing that the trial court had erred in finding that [R.C.
2925.03](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.03&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(C)(5)(b)
imposes strict liability. The appellate court agreed and reversed the
judgment of the trial court, concluding that the culpable mental state
associated with [R.C.
2925.03](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.03&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(C)(5)(b)
is "knowingly."

 The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether [R.C.
2925.03](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.03&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(C)(5)(b),
which elevates trafficking in LSD to a fourth-degree felony if the
offense is committed "in the vicinity of a school," imposes strict
criminal liability on a defendant. We make our determination against the
backdrop of [R.C.
2901.04](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2901.04&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(A),
which states that "\[s\]ections of the Revised Code defining offenses or
penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally
construed in favor of the accused."

 The case against appellee begins with his violation of [R.C.
2925.03](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.03&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(A),
which itself requires a mental state of "knowingly":

is in play because appellee was selling LSD, and because he was selling
that substance in the vicinity of a school. The relevant statutory
language is as follows:

"(C) Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of one of
the following: ... 

"(5) If the drug involved in the violation is L.S.D. or a compound,
mixture, preparation, or substance containing L.S.D., whoever violates
division (A) of this section is guilty of trafficking in L.S.D. The
penalty for the offense shall be determined as follows: ...

 "(b) ... \[I\]f the offense was committed in the vicinity of a school
or in the vicinity of a juvenile, trafficking in L.S.D. is a felony of
the fourth degree, and [division (C) of section 2929.13 of the Revised
Code](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2929.13&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))
applies in determining whether to impose a prison term on the offender."

The mental state of the offender is a part of every criminal offense in
Ohio except for those plainly imposing strict liability. [R.C.
2901.21](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2901.21&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(A)(2)
requires that, in order to be found guilty of a criminal offense, a
person must have "the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining
the offense."

          R.C. 2901.21(B) addresses strict liability statutes and those
statutes that do not address a culpable mental state. That statute
reads:

"When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is
not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section
neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose
strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the
offense."

Thus, recklessness is the catchall culpable mental state for criminal
statutes that fail to mention any degree of culpability, except for
strict liability statutes, where the accused's mental state is
irrelevant. However, for strict liability to be the mental standard, the
statute must plainly indicate a purpose to impose it. ...

          Here, we are dealing with another pair of discrete clauses
separated by "or." The phrase at issue in [R.C.
2925.03](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.03&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(C)(5)(b)
reads:

"\[I\]f the offense was committed *in the vicinity of a school* or *in
the vicinity of a juvenile,* trafficking in L.S.D. is a felony of the
fourth degree, and [division (C) of section 2929.13 of the Revised
Code](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2929.13&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))
applies in determining whether to impose a prison term on the offender."
(Emphasis added.)

Standing alone, "in the vicinity of a school or in the vicinity of a
juvenile" does not indicate any required degree of mental culpability.
However, each clause, "in the vicinity of a school" and "in the vicinity
of a juvenile," is separately defined in the chapter's definitional
section. "In the vicinity of a juvenile," as defined in [R.C.
2925.01](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.01&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(BB),
employs strict liability terms:

"(BB) An offense is 'committed in the vicinity of a juvenile' if the
offender commits the offense within one hundred feet of a juvenile or
within the view of a juvenile, regardless of whether the offender knows
the age of the juvenile, whether the offender knows the offense is being
committed within one hundred feet of or within view of the juvenile, or
whether the juvenile actually views the commission of the offense."

[R.C.
2925.01](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.01&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(BB)
makes it abundantly clear that the offender's mental state is irrelevant
in determining whether the offender has committed an offense "in the
vicinity of a juvenile." An offender is liable whether or not he knows
the age of the juvenile, or whether he realizes that a juvenile is in
the vicinity.

          By contrast, the definition of "in the vicinity of a school,"
contained in [R.C.
2925.01](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.01&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(P),
lacks the express strict liability language of [R.C.
2925.01](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.01&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(BB).
That definition reads:

"(P) An offense is 'committed in the vicinity of a school' if the
offender commits the offense on school premises, in a school building,
or within one thousand feet of the boundaries of any school premises."

The General Assembly, in imposing the strict liability requirement for
drug sales "in the vicinity of a juvenile," perfectly illustrates what
[R.C.
2901.21](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2901.21&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(B)
calls a "purpose to impose strict liability." Additionally, the stark
contrast between the definition of "committed in the vicinity of a
school" and the definition of "committed within the vicinity of a
juvenile" indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to impose
strict liability for selling LSD in the "vicinity of a school" section.

          ... \[I\]f one part of a clause explicitly sets forth a mental
state, that mental state does not apply to another discrete clause
within that subsection. In fact, it is an indication that the General
Assembly is attaching differing mental states as to the two distinct
clauses. As the majority wrote in *Maxwell,* "\[t\]he decision in *Wac*
demonstrates that a crime may have different degrees of mental
culpability for different elements." [*Maxwell,* 95 Ohio St.3d 254,
2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, ¶
30.](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2002249548&pubNum=578&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))
We find that the language employed by the General Assembly in the [R.C.
2925.01](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.01&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(P)
and (BB) definitions establishes differing levels of culpability for
offenses committed "in the vicinity of a juvenile" and "in the vicinity
of a school," plainly indicating that the General Assembly's purpose was
to impose strict liability for acts committed "in the vicinity of a
juvenile" but not for acts committed "in the vicinity of a school." 

Moreover, we find that the differing degrees of mental culpability for
offenses committed near a school as opposed to near a juvenile are
consistent with a coherent legislative policy. 

The distance requirement for an act to be committed within "the vicinity
of a juvenile" is only 100 feet or "within view of the juvenile." Drug
trafficking is a dangerous activity. Beyond the psychic danger of seeing
drugs being sold, there is a very real physical danger surrounding a
drug transaction, even for nonparticipants. Thus, a child, whether in
view or not, could become a part of the collateral damage of a failed
transaction. The threat to a child is real and imminent. 

On the other hand, to be "in the vicinity of a school," an offender
could, by definition, be 1,000 feet away from a school. A child may not
necessarily be nearby, or even in the school. The transaction could
occur in the late evening hours, or in summer, or during any other
period of the year that the school is closed. 

The difference between the potential peril of a transaction that occurs
"in the vicinity of a school" and "in the vicinity of a juvenile" is
significant. "In the vicinity of a school" addresses danger that can be
theoretical; "in the vicinity of a juvenile" addresses a real, present
danger. Because the "vicinity of a juvenile" offense is so much more
dangerous, the General Assembly has determined that the offender's
knowledge that a juvenile is nearby is irrelevant. Also, since "in the
vicinity of a juvenile" includes being in view of a juvenile, its
parameters can expand well beyond 100 feet. Thus, if an offense occurs
within 1,000 feet of a school, the offender still can be subject to
strict criminal liability if there is a juvenile within view. As the
danger to children becomes more real, the culpable mental state gets
stricter. 

Having determined that the General Assembly's purpose was to impose
differing culpable mental states for acts committed "in the vicinity of
a juvenile" and "in the vicinity of a school," we must determine what
culpable mental state applies to offenses that occur "in the vicinity of
a school." Since the definition of "in the vicinity of a school"
includes no culpable mental state, we employ [R.C.
2901.21](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2901.21&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(B)
to provide the requisite culpability for the offense in question. We
therefore hold that the culpable mental state of recklessness applies to
the offense of trafficking in LSD "in the vicinity of a school" under
[R.C.
2925.03](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000279&cite=OHSTS2925.03&originatingDoc=I80c1c36dd44e11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation))(C)(5)(b). 

Although the court of appeals found that the requisite mental state is
"knowingly," and we conclude that recklessness is the appropriate
standard, we nevertheless affirm. A reviewing court is not authorized to
reverse a correct judgment merely because it was reached for the wrong
reason. 

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and remand
the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.

then provides a sentencing enhancement "if the offense \[of knowingly
selling or offering to sell LSD\] was committed in the vicinity of a
school \* \* \*." Although the statute's enhancement provision does not
specify a degree of culpability, the section defining Lozier's offense
does. Thus, [R.C.

required for a sentencing enhancement under [R.C.

...

\[A\] mental element cannot be imputed from one discrete clause to
another and that the exclusion of a mental element from a discrete
clause indicates the applicability of strict liability where the section
defining the offense includes a mental element. I would follow *Wac* and
*Maxwell* and hold that the knowledge requirement of [R.C.

cannot be imputed to [R.C.

and that the exclusion of a mental element from [R.C.

knowledge requirement, subjects the described conduct to strict
liability. ... 

I find further support for my position that R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b)
describes a strict liability offense in United States v. Falu, 776 F.2d
46(2nd Cir. 1985), which resolved the same issue presented herein within
the context of former 21 U.S.C. § 845(a), a federal statute that was
analogous to R.C. 2925.03. In *Falu*, the district court resolved that
Section 845(a) imposed strict liability. Although I would not subjugate
my independent judicial analysis to that of my learned colleagues on the
federal bench, I recognize that the universal purpose of enhancing
penalties for trafficking in drugs in the vicinity of schools is to
protect children from the pariahs that are drug dealers. Thus, the
*Falu* court found, "\[A\] requirement that the dealer know that a sale
is geographically within the prohibited area would undercut this
unambiguous legislative design." *Falu* at 50. I wholeheartedly agree,
and I believe that the same rationale applies to requiring recklessness.

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

1.  The dissent in *Lozier* is persuaded by a federal court's analysis
    of a similar statute. Does it matter that the federal Code does not
    contain an equivalent to MPC § 2.02(3) or § 2.02(4) while the Ohio
    legislature has enacted (roughly) equivalent provisions in Ohio Rev.
    Code § 2901.21(A), (B) & (C)(1)?

2.  Does it matter whether the "school vicinity" provision, Ohio Rev.
    Code § 2925.03(C)(5)(b), defines an "element" or a "sentencing
    enhancement"? Neither term is defined by the legislature---not in
    Ohio Code Rev. § 2901.01's list of "general provisions definitions,"
    nor in Chapter 2929, which covers "Penalties and Sentencing" and
    includes a list of "penalties and sentencing general definitions."
    Does that absence mean courts should not draw such a distinction? If
    they should, how can one tell which label applies to which parts of
    a criminal statute?

** **

**Ohio Rev. Code § 2901.21 Criminal liability, culpability**.

\(A\) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is
not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:

\(1\) The person\'s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person
is capable of performing;

\(2\) The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each
element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language
defining the offense.

\(B\) When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree
of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then
culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense.
The fact that one division of a section plainly indicates a purpose to
impose strict liability for an offense defined in that division does not
by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability
for an offense defined in other divisions of the section that do not
specify a degree of culpability.

\(C\)

\(1\) When language defining an element of an offense that is related to
knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person
acts recklessly. ...

\(F\) As used in this section:

\(1\) Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor\'s
control of the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended
possession. ...

\(3\) \"Culpability\" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or
negligence, as defined in section 2901.22 of the Revised Code.

 

 

 

Mental State Practice Problems

 

**Consider the following in light of the MPC\'s culpability
provisions**:

**Problem 1:** D wants to kill V, so D drives a car into V at a very
high speed. At the time, V is holding their infant X, whom D loves and
does not want to kill. Both V and X die.\
\
a) With regard to V, what mens rea did D possess under MPC § 2.02?\
\
b) With regard to X, what mens rea did D possess under MPC § 2.02?

**Problem 2: **Jane runs a business buying and reselling used goods on
eBay. She recently bought 5 laptop computers with "Property of Santa
Clara University" stickers on the backs.

Consider the consequences of her actions under these statutes:

**California Penal Code § 496 "Receiving Stolen Property" **

 Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen
..., knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished
by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, ...

**California Penal Code § 2-24-7-1:** 

The word \"knowingly\" imports only a knowledge that the facts exist
which bring the act or omission within the provisions of this code. It
does not require any knowledge of the unlawfulness of such act or
omission.

1\) Is she guilty of Receiving Stolen Property if, suspecting they were
stolen, she decides not to resell the laptops?

2\) Is she guilty of Receiving Stolen Property if the seller told her
(and she believed him) that the laptops were discarded in a campus trash
bin?\
\
3) Is she guilty of Receiving Stolen Property if she decided not to
unpack and examine the laptops prior to reselling them because the price
was so low? \
\
4) What result under the same facts if California adopted MPC § 2.02(7)?

**Problem 3**: D is a nurse in a nursing home in an MPC state. After
months of sheltering in place, he decides he can't stand the isolation,
and he attends a wild indoor dance party. Unlike most of the guests, who
didn't wear masks, D wore his mask except when he needed to kiss
someone. D returns to work the following week and always wears a mask
while on the job; he later tests positive for Covid-19. Then, a week
later, one of D's patients tests positive for the virus. 

D is charged with **Felony Transmission of a Communicable Disease:**  

A person commits a class "D" felony when the person is reckless as to
whether they have a contagious or infectious disease and exposes an
uninfected person to the contagious or infectious disease acting with a
reckless disregard as to whether the uninfected person contracts the
contagious or infectious disease, and the conduct results in the

State v. Blurton

No. 3236

**\[ ... \]**

CURETON, Judge:

A jury convicted Gregory R. Blurton of two counts of armed robbery,
kidnapping, grand larceny of a motor vehicle, and failure to stop for a
blue light. The trial court sentenced Blurton to three life sentences
for the kidnapping and armed robbery convictions, ten years for grand
larceny, and three years for failing to stop for a blue light, with all
sentences running concurrently. Blurton appeals. We reverse and remand
for a new trial.

*FACTS*

On April 6, 1997, Blurton entered the Orangeburg WalMart between 11:30
p.m. and 12:00 midnight. After asking for Roger, an assistant manager
who was not working that night, Blurton told assistant manager Brandon
Beckman he needed access to the electrical room to do some work.[^1]
**\[ ... \]**

As Blurton and Beckman walked away, Blurton pulled out a gun and
demanded that Beckman take him to the cash office and give him the money
inside. Brenda Arant, the cash office clerk, was still inside the
office. Blurton ordered Beckman to get on the floor and demanded Arant
fill a shopping bag with money. Blurton screamed his orders and
threatened to shoot Beckman and Arant if they did not cooperate. **\[
... \]**

At trial, Blurton did not deny committing the acts of which he was
accused, but argued a lack of criminal intent. During his testimony, he
explained that James Mayfield, another assistant manager of the
Orangeburg Wal-Mart, was a former Navy SEAL who also worked for the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He further explained that Mayfield
recruited him to assist the CIA in its effort to infiltrate a drug
cartel. In exchange for his assistance, Blurton was promised a new
identity and a presidential pardon for several bank robberies he
committed in the 1970s. Blurton claimed Mayfield gave him surveillance
and firearms training and loaned him hand to hand combat videos
developed by a Navy SEAL instructor. Additionally, Blurton testified he
had completed several assignments in relation to the CIA's infiltration
plan, codenamed "Operation Double White."

The "staged" robbery of the Wal-Mart was Phase Three of the operation,
an attempt to convince the drug cartel that Blurton was a wanted and
dangerous man, thereby facilitating his infiltration of the group. He
explained the robbery was fake and, according to Mayfield, both Beckman
and Roger were aware of the plan. **\[ ... \]**Blurton was supposed to
leave the money at a specific drop location at the back of a hotel,
where Mayfield would retrieve it and promptly return it to Wal-Mart on
behalf of the CIA. According to Blurton, he had to pretend the robbery
was real to put on a "show" for the security cameras and members of the
local sheriffs department who, according to Mayfield, were involved with
the drug cartel.

**\[ ... \]**

Although Blurton consistently maintained that he was working for the CIA
when he committed the acts involved in each of the charged offenses, his
trial counsel simply attempted to prove Blurton genuinely believed he
was a CIA operative at the time of the alleged crimes and thus lacked
criminal intent.

*LAW/ANALYSIS*

I. Evidentiary Issues

Blurton's trial counsel attempted to present evidence which would
corroborate his explanation of events and support his defense of lack of
criminal intent. The evidence included (1) taped telephone conversations
between Blurton and Mayfield; (2) testimony that the investigating
officer thought Blurton actually believed he was part of a CIA
operation; (3) testimony that others heard and believed Mayfield's claim
that he was a former Navy SEAL; and (4) two newspaper articles which
showed Mayfield convinced the local newspaper he was a Navy SEAL. The
trial court excluded this evidence. **\[ ... \]**

*A. Taped Conversations*

Blurton's counsel sought to admit taped telephone conversations between
Blurton and Mayfield which were made without Mayfield's knowledge. **\[
... \]**During the conversations, Mayfield repeatedly affirmed or failed
to deny Blurton's statements that Mayfield had involved him in the CIA
operation and that the robbery was staged. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Because these conversations would have added credence to
Blurton's defense that he lacked criminal intent and were not hearsay,
the trial court erred in excluding them. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

*C. Whether Others Believed Mayfield to be a Navy SEAL*

Blurton also attempted to introduce testimony that other people at
Wal-Mart heard and believed Mayfield's statements that he was a former
Navy SEAL. **\[ ... \]**Blurton asserts the court abused its discretion
in excluding the evidence. We agree.

**\[ ... \]**

Essentially, the excluded testimony would have shown that it was common
belief among Wal-Mart employees, fueled by Mayfield's own statements,
that he was a former Navy SEAL. The fact that Mayfield told this
falsehood about his past to others, and that they believed him, tended
to corroborate Blurton's claimed belief in the same falsehood. This
would help explain why Blurton would believe Mayfield's claim that he
worked for the CIA. **\[ ... \]**Thus, the evidence shows Blurton's
state of mind at the time he committed the crimes. The evidence was
relevant to Blurton's argument that he lacked criminal intent, a
necessary element of the charged crimes. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed, Blurton's appealed convictions are reversed
and his case is remanded for a new trial.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

Notes and Questions (State v. Blurton)

 

**Notes & Questions **

1.  The defense\'s case for Blurton rested on what is called a \"failure
    of proof\" argument. If Blurton genuinely believed the assistant
    manager\'s story, it would mean that the state failed to prove that
    he had the requisite mens rea. This kind of argument is helpful to
    the defense because the burden to prove each element of a crime
    beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the prosecution. Could an
    \"insanity defense\" or a showing of diminished mental capacity have
    also worked for Blurton? What evidence would he have needed to make
    such claims? Which defense (failure-of-proof vs. insanity vs.
    diminished capacity) strikes you as the best argument in Blurton\'s
    favor? Why? 

2.  On a different note: Why should we let Blurton off the hook?
    Couldn\'t Blurton\'s stupidity in believing the Navy Seal-mastermind
    story easily have resulted in serious harm? What justifications for
    punishment might be relevant to consider as you answer this
    question? 

3.  You are the prosecutor in this case. What, if anything, is the
    mastermind-assistant manager guilty of? 

4.  Even as we continue to apply the legal framework of mens rea, it is
    important to keep in mind that these legal classifications rest on
    somewhat antiquated understandings of the human mind. The
    possibility that new developments in neuroscience might raise
    concerns about how criminal law understands volition and intent is
    actually a hotly debated issue within legal scholarship. Consider
    the following passage, for example: 

Although the Model Penal Code brought much-needed clarity to the
concepts of actus reus and mens rea, it has by no means solved the
conceptual problems of what kinds of things should fall into the
categories of volition, intent, and choice. For one thing, . . . both
conscious, voluntary conduct (actus reus) and the various levels of
intent (mens rea) require a reasoning process relating what the person
perceives to be reality with the situation within which he must act (or
not) and how. This reasoning, or imaginative process, may be greatly
altered if the brain is not functioning correctly . . . . In other
words, the law attempts to separate categories that are not really
separable.

\[T\]he legal meaning of choice, intent, and volition originated, not
from empirical studies about human brains and behavior, but from
ungrounded beliefs about human nature. Despite a paradigm shift in
understanding human behavior that has occurred through new developments
in neurobiology, the law still operates on outdated nineteenth century
assumptions about how human beings function. As a result, the categories
into which some of these human actions belong are porous and
indeterminate. The separate legal categories of actus reus and mens rea
and their meanings reflect outdated assumptions about human nature and
the objectives of criminal justice.

People v. Conley

 

Illinois Appellate Court

187 Ill. App. 3d 234

No. 1---86---2651

1989-08-02

**\[ ... \]**

JUSTICE CERDA

delivered the opinion of the court:

The defendant, William J. Conley, was charged with two counts of
aggravated battery based on permanent disability and great bodily harm.
**\[ ... \]** He was found guilty after a jury trial of aggravated
battery based solely on permanent disability on July 17, 1986. The
defendant's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new
trial were denied, and the defendant was sentenced to 30 months'
probation including 40 days of periodic imprisonment. On appeal, it is
contended that: (1) the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the victim incurred a permanent disability and that the defendant
intended to inflict a permanent disability; **\[ ... \]**For the
following reasons, we affirm.

The defendant was charged with aggravated battery in connection with a
fight which occurred at a party on September 28, 1985, in unincorporated
Orland Township. Approximately 200 high school students attended the
party and paid admission to drink unlimited beer. One of those students,
Sean O'Connell, attended the party with several friends. At some point
during the party, Sean's group was approached by a group of 20 boys who
apparently thought that someone in Sean's group had said something
derogatory. Sean's group denied making a statement and said they did not
want any trouble. Shortly thereafter, Sean and his friends decided to
leave and began walking toward their car which was parked a half block
south of the party.

A group of people were walking toward the party from across the street
when someone from that group shouted "There's those guys from the
party." Someone emerged from that group and approached Sean, who had
been walking with his friend Marty Carroll 10 to 15 steps behind two
other friends**\[ ... \]**. That individual demanded that Marty give him
a can of beer from his six-pack. Marty refused, and the individual
struck Sean in the face with a wine bottle, causing Sean to fall to the
ground. The offender attempted to hit Marty, but missed as Marty was
able to duck. Sean sustained broken upper and lower jaws and four broken
bones in the area between the bridge of his nose and the lower left
cheek. Sean lost one tooth and had root canal surgery to reposition 10
teeth that had been damaged. Expert testimony revealed that Sean has a
permanent condition called mucosal mouth and permanent partial numbness
in one lip. The expert also testified that the life expectancy of the
damaged teeth might be diminished by a third or a half.

**\[ ... \]**

The defendant initially contends on appeal that the State failed to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sean O'Connell incurred a permanent
disability. Section 12 --- 4(a) of the Criminal Code of 1961 provides
that: "\[a\] person who, in committing a battery, intentionally or
knowingly causes great bodily harm, or permanent disability or
disfigurement commits aggravated battery." (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch.
38, par. 12 --- 4(a).) **\[ ... \]**The defendant does not dispute that
Sean lost a tooth or that surgery was required to repair damaged teeth.
The defendant also does not dispute that Sean will have permanent
partial numbness in one lip or suffer from a condition called mucosal
mouth. **\[ ... \]**

The defendant further argues that the State failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he intended to inflict any permanent disability.
The thrust of defendant's argument is that under section 12 --- 4(a), a
person must intend to bring about the particular harm defined in the
statute. The defendant asserts that while it may be inferred from his
conduct that he intended to cause harm, it does not follow that he
intended to cause permanent disability. The State contends it is not
necessary that the defendant intended to bring about the particular
injuries that resulted. The State maintains it met its burden by showing
that the defendant intentionally struck Sean.

The law on this question is unclear. The defendant relies upon *People
v. Crosser* (1983), **\[ ... \]**452 N.E.2d 857, and *Bay State
Insurance Co. v. Wilson* (1982), **\[ ... \]**440 N.E.2d 131, which both
hold that aggravated battery is a specific intent crime. The State,
however, relies upon *People v. Allen* (1969), **\[ ... \]** 254 N.E.2d
103. In *Allen,* the court wrote that in committing the offense of
aggravated battery, "the only mental state required is that the accused
knowingly and intentionally cause the social harm defined in the
statute, no premeditation or malice being necessary." *(Allen,* 117 Ill.
App. 2d at 27-28.) The court then went on to state that it is not
necessary that the defendant intended to cause the particular injury
which resulted. *(Allen,* 117 Ill. App. 2d at 28.) **\[ ... \]**

For proper resolution of this issue, it is best to return to the
statutory language. Section 12 --- 4(a) employs the terms "intentionally
or knowingly" to describe the required mental state. The relevant
statutes state:

> "4 --- 4. Intent. A person intends, or acts intentionally or with
> intent, to accomplish a result or engage in conduct described by the
> statute defining the offense, when his conscious objective or purpose
> is to accomplish that result or engage in that conduct." (Ill. Rev.
> Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 4 --- 4.)
>
> "4 --- 5. Knowledge. A person knows or acts knowingly or with
> knowledge of:
>
> \(b\) The result of his conduct, described by the statute defining the
> offense, when he is consciously aware that such result is practically
> certain to be caused by his conduct." (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38,
> par. 4 --- 5.)

Section 12 --- 4(a) defines aggravated battery as the commission of a
battery where the offender intentionally or knowingly causes great
bodily harm, or permanent disability or disfigurement. Because the
offense is defined in terms of result, the State has the burden of
proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant either had a
"conscious objective" to achieve the harm defined, or that the defendant
was "consciously aware" that the harm defined was "practically certain
to be caused by his conduct." (See *People v. Herr* (1980), 87 Ill. App.
3d 819, 821**\[ ... \]**.) **\[ ... \]**

Although the State must establish the specific intent to bring about
great bodily harm, or permanent disability or disfigurement under
section 12 --- 4(a), problems of proof are alleviated to the extent that
the ordinary presumption that one intends the natural and probable
consequences of his actions shifts the burden of production, though not
persuasion, to the defendant. *(Farrell,* 89 Ill. App. 3d at 265.) If
the defendant presents evidence contrary to the presumption, then the
presumption ceases to have effect, and the trier of fact considers all
the evidence and the natural inferences drawn therefrom. *(Farrell,* 89
Ill. App. 3d at 265.) Intent can be inferred from the surrounding
circumstances, the offender's words, the weapon used, and the force of
the blow. (See, *e.g., Macklin v. Commonwealth Life & Accident Co.*
(1970), **\[ ... \]** 257 N.E.2d 256.) As the defendant's theory of the
case was mistaken identity, there was no evidence introduced negating
the presumption of intent. However, even if Conley had denied any
intention to inflict permanent disability, the surrounding
circumstances, the use of a bot-tie, the absence of warning and the
force of the blow are facts from which the jury could reasonably infer
the intent to cause permanent disability. Therefore, we find the
evidence sufficient to support a finding of intent to cause permanent
disability beyond a reasonable doubt.

Notes and Questions (People v. Conley)

 

**Notes & Questions **

1.  The operative statute in *Conley* required a mens rea of
    \"intentionally or knowingly\" causing \"great bodily harm.\" (see
    paragraph 10). Given such statutory language, would it have been an
    easier/faster decision for the court if it had simply focused on the
    word \"knowingly\" instead? See the definitions in paragraphs 19-21
    as you consider this question. Next, consider the facts of this case
    under [the MPC](../../4.3-model-penal-code-on-intent/annotate/):
    Would Conley be guilty of \"purposefully\" or \"knowingly\" causing
    great bodily harm? 

2.  Reconsider *Blurton* in light of this case. Would it be reasonable
    for a jury to infer that Blurton intended/knew the natural and
    probable consequences of his actions? In other words, if we applied
    the law from *Conley* to *Blurton*, what result? (Note: when we use
    the word \"law\" in this context, we mean the holding of the case.
    \"Law\" can mean statute, opinion, regulation, or any other legal
    authority that is relevant.)

3.  Essentially, *Conley* held that it is reasonable to infer that all
    the natural and probable consequences of an action were \"intended\"
    by the actor. Such an inference may not seem extreme when one swings
    a bottle at close range at someone\'s face. But consider the
    potential limitlessness of the court\'s logic. Would it make sense
    to apply this rule to less obvious instances as well? Consider
    someone cutting off a car in traffic, resulting in an accident. We
    could say the injuries from the accident were natural and probable
    consequences of bad driving\--but did the bad driver intend the
    result? What would be some reasonable factual scenarios where it
    would make sense to apply the Conley rule? 

4.  *Conley* also introduces us to the concept of transferred intent,
    which rests on the theory that \"the state of mind which one has
    when about to commit a crime upon one person is considered by the
    law to exist and to be equally applicable although the intended act
    affects another person.\" [Wilfred J. Ritz, *Felony Murder,
    Transferred Intent, And The Palsgraf Doctrine In The Criminal Law*,
    16 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 169 (1959)(quoting from 1 Burdick, Law of
    Crime 149
    (1946)).](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3563&context=wlulr) 

5.  The treatment of transferred intent in the Model Penal Code can be
    found in section 2.03(2), reproduced below. Identify the phrases
    that pay for transferred intent. 

-   **MPC SECTION 2.03(2)**

    When purposely or knowingly causing a particular result is an
    element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual
    result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor
    unless:

    (a)   the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated,
    as the case may be, only in the respect that a different person or
    different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm
    designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more
    extensive than that caused; or

    (b)   the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as
    that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in
    its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor's liability
    or on the gravity of his offense.

6.  Consider the following problems\--what result under *Conley*? Under
    the MPC? 

-   \(i\)  A fires a gun at B, intending to kill B. A misses B, killing
    C by accident. Did A kill C purposely, knowingly, recklessly or
    negligently?

    \(ii\) A fires a gun at B, intending to kill B. It ricochets,
    killing both B and C. With what state of mind did A kill C?

State v. Nations

 

Missouri Court of Appeals

676 S.W.2d 282

No. 45349

1984-08-28

**\[ ... \]**

SATZ, Judge.

Defendant, Sandra Nations, owns and operates the Main Street Disco, in
which police officers found a scantily clad sixteen year old girl
"dancing" for "tips". Consequently, defendant was charged with
endangering the welfare of a child "less than seventeen years old," §
568.050 RSMo 1978.[^2] Defendant was convicted and fined \$1,000.00.
Defendant appeals. We reverse.

Defendant contends the state failed to make a submissible case.
Defendant failed to preserve this issue for review on appeal.[^3] We
must, however, consider the issue of submissibility under the doctrine
of plain error. It is manifest injustice for a trial court to submit a
case to the fact finder on evidence insufficient to make a submissible
case. *E.g., State v. Russell,* 581 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Mo.App.1979).

Specifically, defendant argues the state failed to show she knew the
child was under seventeen and, therefore, failed to show she had the
requisite intent to endanger the welfare of a child "less than seventeen
years old." We agree.

The pertinent part of § 568.050 provides:

> "1. A person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a child
> if:
>
> ![](media/rId99.png){width="1.4791666666666667in"
> height="0.4791666666666667in"}
>
> \(2\) He knowingly encourages, aids or causes a child less than
> seventeen years old to engage in any conduct which causes or tends to
> cause the child to come within the provisions of subdivision (l)(c) ..
> of section 211.031, RSMo \...."

The reference to "subdivision (l)(c)" is to § 211.031.l(l)(c) RSMo
(Supp. 1976), which was in effect when § 568.050 was enacted. This
"subdivision" vested in the juvenile court exclusive original
jurisdiction of any proceeding in which a child is alleged to be in need
of care and treatment because "\[t\]he behavior, environment or
associations of the child are injurious to his welfare or to the welfare
of others".[^4] Thus, § 568.050 requires the state to prove the
defendant "knowingly" encouraged a child "less than seventeen years old"
to engage in conduct tending to injure the child's welfare, and
"knowing" the child to be less than seventeen is a material element of
the crime. *See* § 562.021.

"Knowingly" is a term of art, whose meaning is limited to the definition
given to it by our present Criminal Code. Literally read, the Code
defines "knowingly" as actual knowledge --- "A person *'acts
knowingly',* or with knowledge, (1) with respect \... to attendant
circumstances when he is aware \... that those circumstances exist \_"
(Emphasis original). § 562.016.3.[^5] So read, this definition of
"knowingly" or "knowledge" excludes those cases in which "the fact \[in
issue\] would have been known had not the person wilfully 'shut his
eyes' in order to avoid knowing." Perkins, *Criminal Law* 942 (2d ed.
1969). The Model Penal Code, the source of our Criminal Code, does not
ex-elude these cases from its definition of "knowingly". Instead, the
Model Penal Code proposes that "\[w\]hen knowledge of the *existence of
a particular fact* is an element of an offense, such knowledge is
established if a person is aware of a high probability of its
existence\_" (Emphasis added). Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) (Proposed
Official Draft 1962). This definition sounds more like a restatement of
the definition of "recklessly" than "knowingly".[^6] The similarity is
intentional. The Model Penal Code simply proposes that wilful blindness
to a fact "be viewed as one of acting knowingly when what is involved is
a matter of existing fact, but not when what is involved is the result
of the defendant's conduct, necessarily a matter of the future at the
time of acting." [^7] Thus, as noted, the Model Penal Code proposes that
"\[w\]hen knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element
of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a
high probability of its existence Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) (Proposed
Official Draft 1962).

Our legislature, however, did not enact this proposed definition of
"knowingly". Although the definitions of "knowingly" and "recklessly" in
our Criminal Code are almost identical to the primary definitions of
these terms as proposed in the Model Penal Code, *see* Model Penal Code
§ 2.02(2)(b)-(c) (Proposed Official Draft 1962), the Model Penal Code's
proposed expanded definition of "knowingly", encompassing wilful
blindness of a fact, is absent from our Criminal Code. The sensible, if
not compelling, inference is that our legislature rejected the expansion
of the definition of "knowingly" to include wilful blindness of a fact
and chose to limit the definition of "knowingly" to actual knowledge of
the fact.[^8] Thus, in the instant case, the state's burden was to show
defendant actually was aware the child was under seventeen, a heavier
burden than showing there was a "high probability" that defendant was
aware the child was under seventeen. In short, the state's burden was to
prove defendant acted "knowingly", not just "recklessly". The state
proved, however, that defendant acted "recklessly", not "knowingly".
This we conclude from our review of the record.

In our review of the record, we do not weigh the evidence; rather, we
simply determine whether there was sufficient proof for the fact finder
to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. *E.g., State v.
Turner,* 623 S.W.2d 4, 6 (Mo. banc 1981), *cert. denied,* 456 U.S.
931**\[ ... \]**(1982). In so doing, we consider only those facts and
reasonable inferences favorable to the state. *E.g., State v. Franco,*
544 S.W.2d 533, 534 (Mo. banc 1976), *cert. denied,* 431 U.S. 957**\[
... \]** (1977).

The record shows that, at the time of the incident, the child was
sixteen years old. When the police arrived, the child was "dancing" on
stage for "tips" with another female. The police watched her dance for
some five to seven minutes before approaching defendant in the service
area of the bar. Believing that one of the girls appeared to be "young,"
the police questioned defendant about the child's age. Defendant told
them that both girls were of legal age and that she had checked the
girls' identification when she hired them. When the police questioned
the child, she initially stated that she was eighteen but later admitted
that she was only sixteen. She had no identification.

Aside from the child's age, these facts were established by the
testimony of a police officer. The state also called the child as a
witness. Her testimony was no help to the state. She testified the
defendant asked her for identification just prior to the police
arriving, and she was merely crossing the stage to get her
identification when the police took her into custody.[^9] Nor can the
state secure help from the defendant's testimony. She simply
corroborated the child's testimony; i.e., she asked the child for her
identification; the child replied she would "show it to \[her\] in a
minute"; the police then took the child into custody.

These facts simply show defendant was untruthful. Defendant could not
have checked the child's identification, because the child had no
identification with her that day, the first day defendant "hired" the
child. This does not prove that defendant knew the child was less than
seventeen years old. At best, it proves defendant did not know or
refused to learn*the* child's age. The latter is the best case for the
state. But defendant's refusal to learn the age of this "young" child
who was "dancing" "scantily clad" in her disco bar simply proves that
defendant was "aware of a high probability" that the child was under
seventeen, or, stated otherwise, in the definitional language of our
Criminal Code, proves that defendant was conscious of "a substantial and
unjustifiable risk" that the child was under seventeen and that
defendant's disregard of the risk was a "gross deviation" from the norm.
*See* § 562.016.-4. This, however, is not "knowledge" under our Criminal
Code. It is "recklessness", nothing more. Having failed to prove
defendant knew the child's age was less than seventeen, the state failed
to make a submissible case.[^10]

Notes and Questions (State v. Nations)

 

**Notes & Questions** 

1.  How reasonable was Nations\'s ignorance regarding the dancers\' age?
    Should she have been charged with having had \"inquiry notice\" at
    least? Do you think the statute reduces the harm that prompted the
    statute\'s enactment if only \"actual knowledge\" is criminalized? 

2.  On the other hand, rates of conviction and subsequent incarceration
    would certainly rise if a lesser mens rea would suffice for
    conviction. Is overcarceration a price we are willing to pay
    considering the harm to minors in this context? Are there other
    crimes for which we would (or not) be willing to take such risks?
    How might we balance these divergent policy goals? 

3.  Because individual and subjective biases play into how we estimate
    characteristics like age, is there always a risk that some minors
    tend to be more protected than others? [For
    example,](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)
    [social workers, police, and various non-family caregiving adults
    tend to see black children as less innocent and in need of
    protection than  white
    children.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)
    With that in mind, what should be the right standard for knowledge
    within the factual scenario of *Nations*?  

4.  As you saw in this case, a legislature might adopt MPC language in
    its entirety or choose to adopt it partially or in piecemeal. Can we
    assume that the legislature meant to adopt the MPC framework even if
    it didn\'t adopt all of the MPC\'s language, or was this a
    deliberate choice? In *Nations*, does the court assume that actual
    knowledge was a deliberate move or an oversight? Contrast this case
    with how *Morissette* (below) addresses the same question regarding
    statutory construction. \
    \
    One way to clarify this legislative intent, of course, is to pore
    over the documents (earlier versions of bills, committee notes,
    transcripts, etc.) leading up to the legislation. When should a
    court pay attention to legislative intent to aid its statutory
    construction?

State v. Miles

 

**State v. Miles**

South Carolina Court of Appeals

**\[ ... \]**805 S.E.2d 204

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

HILL, J.:

Lance L. Miles appeals his conviction for trafficking in illegal drugs
in violation of section 44-53-370(e)(3) of the South Carolina Code
(Supp. 2016). He argues the trial court erred by: (1) instructing the
jury, in reply to a question they posed during deliberation, that the
State did not have to prove Miles knew the drugs were oxycodone; (2)
denying his directed verdict motion; and (3) admitting three statements
he contends were obtained in violation of *Miranda v. Arizona* , [384
U.S. 436](https://casetext.com/case/miranda-v-arizona)**\[ ...
\]**(1966). We affirm.

I.

While scanning parcels for illegal drugs at the Federal Express office
in West Columbia, agents from the Lexington County Sheriff\'s Office
became suspicious of a package. They arranged for a controlled delivery
to the listed address, which was within an apartment complex.
Surveilling the delivery, they observed the delivery person ring the
doorbell and leave the package by the front door. A few moments later,
an agent noticed Miles exit a nearby apartment and begin walking around
the parking lot. The agent then saw a young female emerge from the
delivery address. She looked at the box, got on her phone, quickly hung
up and went back inside. Miles then got on his phone while walking
towards the box. Miles picked up the box and started back to his
apartment. Seeing the agents advancing to intercept him, he tried to
ditch the box. The agents apprehended and handcuffed him.

**\[ ... \]**Upon obtaining a search warrant and Miles\' consent, the
agents opened the box and discovered three hundred pills that a chemist
later testified contained a total of nine grams of oxycodone. **\[ ...
\]**

Miles was indicted for trafficking in illegal drugs, in violation of
section 44-53-370(e)(3). He did not testify at his trial and moved
unsuccessfully for directed verdict, arguing in part there was
insufficient evidence he knew the box contained oxycodone. During the
jury charge, the trial court gave the following instruction:

> Mr. Miles is charged with trafficking in illegal drugs and in this
> case we are referring to \[o\]xycodone. The State must prove beyond a
> reasonable doubt that the Defendant knowingly delivered, purchased,
> brought into this state, provided financial assistance or otherwise
> aided, abetted, attempted or conspired to sell, deliver, purchase, or
> bring into this state and was knowingly in actual or constructive
> possession or knowingly attempted to become in actual or constructive
> pos\[session\] of the \[o\]xycodone. Possession may be either \...
> actual or constructive.

The trial court charged that the State bore the burden of proving the
amount of oxycodone was more than four grams. The trial court further
instructed that the State had to prove criminal intent, which required a
\"conscious wrongdoing,\" and that intent may be inferred from the
conduct of the parties and other circumstances. After deliberating for
some time, the jury asked the following question: \"Does the \[S\]tate
have to prove that the defendant knowingly brought into the state four
grams or more of \[o\]xycodone or just any amount of illegal drugs in
order to consider this trafficking?\"

The trial court, over Miles\' objection, replied to the jury as follows:

> \[T\]he law in South Carolina is the State does not have to prove that
> the Defendant knew that the drugs in the package were \[o\]xycodone,
> just that he knew that the package contained illegal drugs. However,
> the State does have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
> illegal drugs that were in the package w\[ere\] more than four grams
> of \[o\]xycodone.

The jury later returned with a verdict of guilty. **\[ ... \]**

II\.

Miles\' primary argument on appeal is the trial court\'s supplemental
charge misinformed the jury that the State did not need to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that Miles knew the drug he possessed was oxycodone.
We review jury instructions to determine whether they, as a whole,
adequately communicate the law in light of the issues and evidence
presented at trial. ***\[ ... \]***

Section 44-53-370(e)(3) provides in part:

> Any person who *knowingly* sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers,
> purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial
> assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell,
> manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State,
> or who is *knowingly* in actual or constructive possession or who
> *knowingly* attempts to become in actual or constructive possession
> of: \... four grams or more of any morphine, opium, salt, isomer, or
> salt of an isomer thereof, including heroin, as described in Section
> 44-53-190 or 44-53-210, or four grams or more of any mixture
> containing any of these substances, is guilty of a felony which is
> known as \"trafficking in illegal drugs\"\....

(emphases added).

Miles contends the term \"knowingly\" as used in subsection (e) applies
to each element of the trafficking offense, including the specific type
of drugs listed in (e)(3). The issue of whether trafficking requires
proof that the defendant not only knowingly intended to \"sell\[ \],
manufacture \[ \], cultivate\[ \] \...\" or \"posses\[ \]\" illegal
drugs, but also had knowledge of the precise identity of the illegal
drug being trafficked, has, surprisingly, never been addressed by our
appellate courts.We are mindful that \"statutory interpretation begins
(and often ends) with the text of the statute in question. Absent an
ambiguity, there is nothing for a court to construe, that is, a court
should not look beyond the statutory text to discern its meaning.\"
*Smith v. Tiffany* , [419 S.C. 548,
555--56](https://casetext.com/case/smith-v-norman-k-tiffany-individually-brown-trucking-co#p555)**\[
... \]**(2017) (citations omitted).

Courts grapple often with that tricky adverb \"knowingly.\" In *United
States v. Jones* , [471 F.3d 535,
538](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-jones-1101#p538) (4th Cir. 2006),
the court construed a federal statute that punished \"\[a\] person who
knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the age of 18
years in interstate or foreign commerce \... with intent that the
individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which
any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\" (quoting [18 U.S.C.
§
2423(a)](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-117-transportation-for-illegal-sexual-activity-and-related-crimes/section-2423-transportation-of-minors)
(2000 & Supp. 2003) ). Rejecting the argument that the government was
required to prove the defendant knew the person transported was a minor,
Judge Wilkinson noted:

> \[C\]onstruction of the statute demonstrates that it does not require
> proof of the defendant\'s knowledge of the victim\'s minority. It is
> clear from the grammatical structure of [§
> 2423(a)](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-117-transportation-for-illegal-sexual-activity-and-related-crimes/section-2423-transportation-of-minors)
> that the adverb \"knowingly\" modifies the verb \"transports.\"
> Adverbs generally modify verbs, and the thought that they would
> typically modify the infinite hereafters of statutory sentences would
> cause grammarians to recoil. We see nothing on the face of this

*Id*. at 539.

The United States Supreme Court has not been so gun-shy about the
adverb. They ordinarily read a \"statute that introduces the elements of
a crime with the word 'knowingly' as applying that word to each
element.\" *Flores-Figueroa v. Unit ed States* , [556 U.S. 646,
652](https://casetext.com/case/flores-figueroa-v-united-states-3#p652)**\[
... \]**(2009). They have also found \"the word 'knowingly' applies not
just to the statute\'s verbs but also to the object of those verbs.\"
*McFadden v. United States* , ------ U.S. --------, 135 S.Ct. 2298,
2304**\[ ... \]** (2015).

**\[ ... \]**

But the Court has not gone so far as to hold that a criminal statute
that opens with \"knowingly\" invariably requires each element be proven
by that level of intent. It is commonplace that \"different elements of
the same offense can require different mental states.\" *Staples v.
United States* , [511 U.S. 600,
609](https://casetext.com/case/staples-v-united-states-4#p609)**\[ ...
\]**(1994). Even in *Flores-Figueroa* , the Court acknowledged that
\"knowingly\" does not always modify every element, particularly where
the statutory sentences at issue \"involve special contexts or \...
background circumstances that call for such a reading.\" [556 U.S. at
652](https://casetext.com/case/flores-figueroa-v-united-states-3#p652)**\[
... \]**. The Court emphasized that \"the inquiry into a sentence\'s
meaning is a contextual one.\" *Id.* ; *see also* *Avis Rent A Car Sys.,
Inc. v. Hertz Corp.* , [782 F.2d 381,
385](https://casetext.com/case/avis-rent-a-car-system-inc-v-hertz-corp#p385)
(2d Cir. 1986) (\"Fundamental to any task of interpretation is the
principle that text must yield to context.\") (Friendly, J.).

Our duty is to determine legislative intent, and the text of the statute
is often the best evidence of that intent. *Hodges v. Rainey* , [341
S.C. 79, 85](https://casetext.com/case/hodges-v-rainey#p85)**\[ ...
\]**(2000). Yet the text \"must be construed in context and in light of
the intended purpose of the statute in a manner which harmonizes with
its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.\" *Cabiness v.
Town of James Island,* [393 S.C. 176,
192](https://casetext.com/case/cabiness-v-town-of-james-island#p192)**\[
... \]** (2011) (citation and internal quotations omitted).

We find that by using \"knowingly\" in subsection (e), the Legislature
did not intend to require the State to prove a defendant knew the
specific type of illegal drug he was trafficking. Section 44-53-370 is
concerned with criminalizing numerous forms of conduct involving illegal
drugs. Thus, subsection (c) decrees \"\[i\]t shall be unlawful for any
person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance,\"
subject to certain exceptions not relevant here. [S.C. Code Ann. §
44-53-370(c)](https://casetext.com/statute/code-of-laws-of-south-carolina-1976/title-44-health/chapter-53-poisons-drugs-and-other-controlled-substances/article-3-narcotics-and-controlled-substances/section-44-53-370-prohibited-acts-a-penalties)
(Supp. 2016). Our supreme court has held the language now codified in
subsection (c) requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant knew he possessed a \"controlled substance.\" *State
v. Attardo* , [263 S.C. 546,
549](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-attardo-1#p549), [211 S.E.2d 868,
869](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-attardo-1#p869) (1975).
Subsection (d) then sets forth the penalties for possession based on the
type of controlled substance. [S.C. Code Ann. §
44-53-370(d)](https://casetext.com/statute/code-of-laws-of-south-carolina-1976/title-44-health/chapter-53-poisons-drugs-and-other-controlled-substances/article-3-narcotics-and-controlled-substances/section-44-53-370-prohibited-acts-a-penalties)
(Supp. 2016).

This brings us to trafficking, subsection (e). Tellingly, our supreme
court has explained \"\[i\]t is the amount of \[the controlled
substance\], rather than the criminal act, which triggers the
trafficking statute, and distinguishes trafficking from distribution and
simple possession.\" *State v. Raffaldt,* [318 S.C. 110,
117](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-raffaldt#p117)**\[ ...
\]**(1995). While the court in *Raffaldt* was not confronted with the
mental state required for a trafficking conviction, that issue was
addressed in *State v. Taylor* , [323 S.C. 162,
166](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-taylor-1385#p166)**\[ ...
\]**(Ct. App. 1996). In *Taylor* , the defendant was charged with
trafficking more than ten grams of crank, in violation of section
44-53-375(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1995), which contains
language nearly identical to section 44-53-370(e), including placement
of the adverb \"knowingly.\" Taylor argued the language required the
trial court to charge the jury that \"they could not find \[her\] guilty
of trafficking in crank unless she knew there were ten grams or more.\"
*Taylor* , [323 S.C. at
167](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-taylor-1385#p167)**\[ ... \]**.
Relying on *Raffaldt* *,* we disagreed. *Id* .

*Raffaldt* and *Taylor* illuminate the \"special context\" revealed by
viewing section 44-53-370 as a whole. Because section 44-53-370(c) only
requires knowledge that the substance is \"controlled,\" and because
*Raffaldt* and *Taylor* tell us the only difference between the elements
of distribution and simple possession and the elements of trafficking is
the amount of the controlled substance involved, there is no reason to
suspect the Legislature meant to require knowledge of the specific type
of controlled substance in trafficking prosecutions. Miles\'
interpretation depends upon isolating \"knowingly\" in subsection (e)
and extending its modifying reach not only to \"possession,\" but to the
specific type of drugs listed. Magnifying individual words of a statute
and insisting they be interpreted concretely can lead to strange
results. One could, for example, myopically diagram subsection (e)(3)
and conclude it criminalizes the possession of more than four grams of
table salt, or even the conduct of the delivery person in this case.
Further, were we to adopt Miles\' version of subsection (e), the State
would have to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant
not only knew the drugs were oxycodone, but also knew that oxycodone is
a \"morphine, opium, salt, isomer, or salt of an isomer thereof,
including heroin, as described in Section 44-53-190 or 44-53-210, or
\... any mixture containing any of these substances.\" We doubt the
Legislature, in passing the drug trafficking laws, meant to create a
scenario where a defendant is culpable only if armed with a proficiency
in chemistry on par with a pharmacist or Walter White. That is why
considering the words in their surrounding environment is essential,
especially here where the statute runs to nearly five-thousand words and
represents the Legislature\'s will in the massive field of drug
interdiction. Given this background, \"\[i\]f ever we are justified in
reading a statute, not narrowly as through a keyhole, but in the broad
light of the evils it aimed at and the good it hoped for, it is here.\"
*United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess* , [317 U.S. 537,
557](https://casetext.com/case/us-ex-rel-marcus-v-hess#p557)**\[ ...
\]**(1943) (Jackson, J., dissenting).

***\[ ... \]***

\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

When a statute can be read in its ordinary sense, courts have no right
to engineer an extraordinary one. That the Legislature titled the
offense defined by subsection (e)(3) as \"trafficking in illegal drugs\"
affirms our conclusion that a defendant need not know the precise
identity of the controlled substance to be guilty. *See* *Univ. of S.C.
v. Elliott* , [248 S.C. 218,
221](https://casetext.com/case/university-of-sc-v-elliott#p221)**\[ ...
\]**(1966) (\"\[I\]t is proper to consider the title or caption of an
act in aid of construction to show the intent of the legislature.\").
This sense becomes inescapable when we consider subsection (e)(3)\'s
reference to sections 44-53-190 and 44-53-210 of the South Carolina Code
(Supp. 2016), which set forth Schedules I and II governing
classification of controlled substances. While we can interpret statutes
by bringing in rules of grammar, logic, and other tools, we must be
careful not to construe common sense out.

Courts in many other states share our conclusion that proving the
defendant knew the specific type of drug is not required in trafficking
and other controlled substance offenses. ***\[ ... \]***

We cannot leave this issue without discussing the important canon of
statutory construction that penal statutes are to be strictly construed.
This rule of lenity applies when a criminal statute is ambiguous, and
requires any doubt about a statute\'s scope be resolved in the
defendant\'s favor. *Berry v. State* , [381 S.C. 630,
633](https://casetext.com/case/berry-v-state-220#p633)**\[ ...
\]**(2009). But the rule of lenity is not a device to create ambiguity,
nor should a court invoke it before considering the words of the statute
in context. *State v. Dawkins* , [352 S.C. 162,
166--67](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-dawkins-24#p166)**\[ ...
\]**(2002) ; *State v. Firemen\'s Ins. Co. of Newark, N.J.,* [164 S.C.
313](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-firemens-insurance-co)**\[ ...
\]** (1931) ( \"The rule that a penal statute must be strictly construed
does not prevent the courts from calling to their aid all the other
rules of construction and giving each its appropriate scope, and is not
violated by giving the words of the statute a reasonable meaning
according to the sense in which they were intended, and disregarding
\... even the demands of exact grammatical propriety.\" (citation and
internal quotations omitted)); *see also* *United States v. Bass,* [404
U.S. 336,
347](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-bass-21#p347)**\[ ...
\]**(1971) (court should rely on lenity only if, \"\[a\]fter
'seiz\[ing\] every thing from which aid can be derived,' \" it is \"left
with an ambiguous statute\" (quoting *United States v. Fisher* , 6 U.S.
(2 Cranch) 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805) (Marshall, C.J.))).

One of the foundations of the rule of lenity is the concept of fair
notice---the idea that those trying to walk the straight and narrow are
entitled to know where the line is drawn between innocent conduct and
illegality. *McBoyle v. United States* , [283 U.S. 25,
27](https://casetext.com/case/mcboyle-v-united-states#p27)**\[ ...
\]**(1931) (\"\[I\]t is reasonable that a fair warning should be given
to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what
the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning
fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.\"). The line for
conduct involving contraband is not merely clear but fluorescent. At
least since *State v. Freeland,* [106 S.C.
220](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-freeland-8)**\[ ... \]**(1916),
we have required a defendant to know or be willfully ignorant that he
was dealing with contraband drugs to satisfy criminal intent. This
removes innocent activity, inadvertence or accident from the law\'s
grasp. At any rate, we need not apply the rule of lenity here, as
context has convinced us section 44-53-370(e)(3) does not require proof
of knowledge of the specific identity of the controlled substance.
*Carter v. United States,* [530 U.S. 255,
269](https://casetext.com/case/carter-v-united-states-30#p269)**\[ ...
\]** (2000) (courts are required \"to read into a statute only that
*mens rea* which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from
'otherwise innocent conduct' \").

Another foundation of the rule of lenity is the separation of powers.
Our Constitution commits the task of defining criminal offenses solely
to the Legislative Branch. *Bass* , [404 U.S. at
347-48](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-bass-21#p347), [**\[
... \]**](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-bass-21); *United
States v. Wiltberger* , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95**\[ ... \]** (1820).
If the Legislature believes our interpretation expands or is otherwise
contrary to the scope it intended section 44-53-370(e)(3) and its harsh
penalty scheme to have, it can amend the statute.

The trial judge\'s instructions---including his initial charge that
criminal intent consists of \"conscious wrongdoing\"---conveyed the
pertinent legal standards to the jury. He further correctly charged that
the State still bore the burden of proving the drug quantity and
identity.

III\.

Miles next argues he was entitled to a directed verdict because the
State presented insufficient evidence that he knowingly trafficked
oxycodone. As we have held, the State needed only to prove Miles knew
the item was a controlled substance. Because there was evidence Miles
possessed the box, the jury was free to infer he knew what was in it. As
the assistant solicitor pointed out, the evidence was literally lying at
Miles\' feet. *See* *State v. Gore* , [318 S.C. 157,
163](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-gore-23#p163)**\[ ... \]** (Ct.
App. 1995) (\"Possession gives rise to an inference of the possessor\'s
knowledge of the character of the substance.\"). Of course, Miles also
admitted he knew the box contained drugs. Viewing the evidence in the
light most favorable to the State, these circumstances go far beyond
mere suspicion. There was ample direct and substantial circumstantial
evidence from which Miles\' guilt could be fairly and logically deduced.
**\[ ... \]**

IV\.

**\[ ... \]**

V.

The trial court did not err in its supplemental instruction to the jury
that the State was only required to prove Miles knowingly trafficked in
a controlled substance. There was sufficient evidence to carry the case
to the jury, and even if the *Miranda* issue was preserved, we find no
prejudice. Miles\' conviction is therefore

Notes & Questions (State v. Miles)

 

1\.    In *Flores-Figueroa* (discussed in *Miles*), Flores-Figueroa was
convicted of illegal entry into the U.S. without inspection, misusing
immigration documents, and aggravated identity theft. Aggravated
identity theft (§1028A(a)(1) of the U.S. Code) adds a mandatory two-year
sentence to anyone who "knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without
lawful authority, a means of identification of another person." The
facts showed that Mr. Flores-Figueroa presented to his employer
counterfeit Social Security and alien registration cards that contained
identification numbers that had been assigned to other people. But he
testified that, although he knew the documents he presented were
counterfeit, he did not know that the numbers on the documents in fact
belonged to other people. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that
Flores-Figueroa had to know that the means of identification belonged to
another person\--that is, it was not enough merely to show that he knew
the identification materials were false.

How would *Flores-Figueroa* be decided under *State v.* *Miles*?

2\.    A statute reads, "It is unlawful to knowingly fire a machine gun
in a densely populated neighborhood and thereby injure a bystander."
What words within this statute are modified by the adverb \"knowingly\"?
In other words, what knowledge on the defendant\'s part is required by
this statute for a successful conviction? Apply the holdings in *Miles,*
*Nations,* and *Flores-Figueroa* to interpret this statute. 

3\.    Two years ago, alarmed by the noise created when residents drove
motorized vehicles through Central Park, the town of Quietville passed
this ordinance: "No vehicles permitted in the park." Shortly thereafter,
the police arrested five teenagers, claiming they had broken the law by
riding their bicycles through the park. In response to the teens'
successful challenge to their arrest, Quietville amended its law. It now
reads: \"Out of respect for the quiet of our town, it is illegal to
enter the park with a motorized vehicle.\"

Last month, a group of patriots sought to place a functioning military
truck in the park as a war memorial. Police arrested the group as they
were driving the truck into Central Park.

You are their defense lawyer. Write a paragraph with no more than 3
sentences stating the relevant rule of law and explaining why
application of that rule to these facts means that defendants are not
guilty.

4\.    Revisiting the facts of *Miles*: What are some \"good facts\" for
the prosecution? What facts allow us to reasonably infer that Miles knew
what he was picking up? By the same token, what are some \"good facts\"
for the defense? In what way could one rebut the prosecution\'s case
regarding what Miles knew?  

5\.    A mistake of fact is a defense against a crime requiring
knowledge. That is, an honest misunderstanding about the crucial facts
can negate the required mens rea. (Note: mistake of fact does not apply
to strict liability crimes where knowledge would be irrelevant.) 

Why didn\'t a mistake of fact defense work for Miles? 

6\.    Consider the following alternative scenarios for Miles and assess
whether a judge or jury might find a mistake of fact: 

a\) Miles received an email from his mother to expect a care package on
that very day. That was, in fact, what he believed he was picking up. 

b\) Miles believed the package contained Adderall, which he uses on days
he needs to attend classes or take exams. 

c\) Miles believed the package contained Oxycodone, but testing revealed
the contents to be table salt. 

d\) Miles believed the package contained Oxycodone, but did not believe
it was against the law to receive such a package. (See \"mistake of
law.\")

In the instant case, we are called upon to decipher the meaning of the
word "suffer," and its analogs, "permit" and "allow." Specifically, we
must decide whether these terms, when used in rules governing the
conduct of holders of a liquor license in Baltimore City, require proof
of knowledge on the part of such licensees.

Appellant, Steven Kougl, owns Club Harem, a Baltimore tavern and adult
entertainment business, and holds a liquor license for that location
issued by appellee, the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for
Baltimore City ("the Liquor Board"). On July 2, 2014, the Liquor Board
charged Kougl with violating three Liquor Board Rules related to
solicitation of prostitution, indecent exposure, and violation of public
morals, all occurring on April 25, 2013, at Club Harem, when an employee
exposed herself to an undercover police officer and then solicited
sexual intercourse from the same officer. The Liquor Board found Kougl
guilty of all three violations and ordered that his liquor license be
suspended for one month. Kougl filed for judicial review in the Circuit
Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the decision of the Liquor
Board.

On appeal to this Court, Kougl raises four questions for our review,
which we have condensed and rephrased as two questions:[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xce01b004dca8772719041e923a40602d73ff41d)

> 1\. Did the Liquor Board make sufficient findings of fact in support
> of the three charged violations of the Liquor Board Rules?
>
> 2\. Did the Liquor Board err in concluding that Kougl was guilty of
> the three violations even though there was no evidence that Kougl had
> knowledge of his employee's behavior?

For reasons set forth herein, we answer both questions in the
affirmative, and thus reverse the judgment of the circuit court and
remand the case to that court for entry of a judgment reversing the
decision of the Liquor Board.

*BACKGROUND*

On April 25, 2013, Detective Fletcher Jackson, a Baltimore City police
officer assigned to the Special Enforcement Section, entered Club Harem
in plain clothes to conduct a prostitution investigation. Jamaica
Brickhouse, a woman who worked at Club Harem, approached Det. Jackson at
the bar and asked if she could join him. Det. Jackson said "sure," and
bought Brickhouse a drink. After some initial conversation, Brickhouse
exposed her breasts to Det. Jackson. Brickhouse invited Det. Jackson to
touch her breasts, which he did. Brickhouse then suggested a lap dance
or a trip to "the VIP," where they could "do whatever up there." Det.
Jackson asked how much it would cost him to have sex with Brickhouse;
Brickhouse replied that it would cost \$170 "for the room," plus a tip
for her services. Det. Jackson said that he could tip \$100, and
Brickhouse agreed. Brickhouse returned to the stage to perform, and Det.
Jackson notified other officers. **\[ ... \]**

Fifteen months after the incident, on July 2, 2014, the Liquor Board
charged Kougl with violating three Liquor Board Rules related to
solicitation of prostitution in violation of Rule 4.17(a), indecent
exposure in violation of Rule 4.17(b), and violation of public morals in
violation of Rule 4.18. On July 17, 2014, the Liquor Board held a
hearing on the charges against Kougl. Det. Jackson was the only witness
for the prosecution; Kougl testified in his own defense. The Liquor
Board voted 2-1 that Kougl was guilty of the three violations[**\[ ...
\]**](#X9a37ea01c510a35623ff0e5b491081adcb5705d) and suspended his
liquor license for one month.

On July 18, 2014, Kougl filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the
circuit court. On March 2, 2015, Kougl filed his Memorandum, in which he
argued that (1) the Liquor Board's decision was not based on substantial
evidence, because "\[t\]here \[wa\]s nothing in \[Det. Jackson's\]
testimony to indicate that the \[licensee knew, allowed or permitted
this type of activity, which is needed to sustain the violations"; (2)
its decision was unreasonable and arbitrary, because the Chairman of the
Liquor Board stated that a licensee "would be responsible for actions of
an employee" regardless of "whether the \[licensee knew or did not know
or allowed or did not allow or permitted or did not permit" the
prohibited activity**\[ ... \]**. On April 15, 2015, the Liquor Board
filed its Response to Kougl's Memorandum, in which it contended that (1)
its decision was based on substantial evidence; (2) its decision was
reasonable**\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]**

*STANDARD OF REVIEW*

Maryland law provides by statute that the action of a local liquor board
is presumed to be proper and places the burden of proof upon the
licensee to show that the decision complained of was arbitrary,
fraudulent, unsupported by substantial evidence, illegal, or against the
public interest. Md.Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol), Art. 2B, § 16 ---
101(e)(l)(i). **\[ ... \]**

*DISCUSSION*

I.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

II\.

Strict Liability

Kougl argues that Rules 4.17 and 4.18 require some evidence or inference
therefrom that Kougl suffered, permitted, or allowed solicitation and
nudity to occur, and there was no evidence to support such a finding.
According to Kougl, there was insufficient evidence for the Liquor Board
to infer that Kougl permitted such conduct to occur "merely by reason
that the dancer solicited the detective."

The Liquor Board responds that the three violations "are, as a matter of
law, strict liability offenses," none of which require "a licensee's
knowledge of the impermissible conduct." The Liquor Board analogizes
Rules 4.17(a) and (b) to Rule 4.01(a), which prohibits sales of alcohol
to minors, to argue that both Rules "contain\[\] both a strict liability
prohibition and a second provision with a knowledge requirement." As for
Rule 4.18, the Liquor Board argues that it "contains no knowledge or
mens rea language. Therefore, it describes a strict liability offense."
According to the Liquor Board, Kougl was found guilty of violating the
strict liability portion of the Rules.

By virtue of its argument that the charged violations are strict
liability offenses, the Liquor Board concedes that the evidence adduced
at the hearing was insufficient to find that Kougl had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violations. Upon review of the record, we
agree that there was simply no evidence of Kougl's actual or
constructive knowledge of the violations.

Whether Rules 4.17 and 4.18 impose a strict liability standard on a
licensee depends on the meaning of the words "suffer," "permit," and
"allow" as used in the Rules. In determining the meaning of such words,
"we apply well-settled rules of statutory construction, the cardinal
rule of \[which\] is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the
Legislature." *Assateague Coastkeeper v. Md. Dep't of Env't,* **\[ ...
\]** 28 A.3d 178 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted).

*Whitley v. Md. State Bd. of Elections,* **\[ ... \]**55 A.3d 37 (2012)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

In accord with the above standard, we turn to the plain meaning of the
subject terms in the Rules. Black's Law Dictionary defines "suffer" as:

> To allow, to admit, or to permit. It includes knowledge of what is to
> be done under sufferance. To suffer an act to be done or a condition
> to exist is to permit or consent to it; to approve of it, and not to
> hinder it. It implies knowledge, a willingness of the mind and
> responsible control or ability to prevent.

*Black's Law Dictionary* 1432 (6th ed.1990) (emphasis added) (citations
omitted). "Permit" is defined as: "To suffer, allow, consent, let; to
give leave or license; to acquiesce, by failure to prevent, or to
expressly assent or agree to the doing of an act." *Id.* at 1140.
Finally, Black's Law Dictionary defines "allow" as:

> The word has no rigid or precise meaning, its import varying according
> to circumstances or context in connection with which it is used. It
> may mean to bestow or assign to any one as his right or due. To
> approve of, accept as true, admit, concede, adopt, or fix. To grant
> something as a deduction or an addition; to abate or deduct; as, to
> allow a sum for leakage. To sanction, either directly or indirectly,
> as opposed to merely suffering a thing to be done; to acquiesce in; to
> suffer; to tolerate.

*Id.* at 76 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).

No Maryland appellate opinion exists regarding the meaning of these
words in the context of the Liquor Board Rules. Other jurisdictions that
use "suffer," "permit," or "allow," in their liquor board rules are
divided on whether such terms impose a strict liability standard, or
whether knowledge on the part of the licensee must be proven.

Wisconsin, Oregon, and New Jersey courts have held that their states'
liquor board rules, all of which use the words "suffer," "permit," or
"allow," impose strict liability on the part of the licensee. In *City
of West Allis v. Megna,* the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that an
ordinance that stated that no licensee shall "either directly or
indirectly suffer or permit any person of either sex under the age of 21
years \... to enter or be on such licensed premises for any purpose,"
imposed a strict liability standard. **\[ ... \]**The Court determined
that "\[p\]roof of knowledge on the part of the tavern keeper that the
patron is actually under age is not required by the statute in order to
obtain a conviction," and that such standard "is a price that the
operator pays for the privilege of becoming licensed." *Id.* at 254.

**\[ ... \]**Finally, in *Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control v.
Maynards Inc.,* the Supreme Court of New Jersey held an ordinance
providing that "\[n\]o licensee shall allow, permit or suffer in or upon
the licensed premises any unlawful possession of or any unlawful
activity pertaining to" narcotics and other controlled dangerous
substances imposed a strict liability standard. **\[ ... \]** 927 A.2d
525, 536 (2007). The Court noted that "\[i\]t has long been the law in
New Jersey that, in the context of the regulation of alcoholic
beverages, 'the word suffer \... imposes responsibility on a licensee,
*regardless of knowledge,* where there is a failure to prevent the
prohibited conduct by those occupying the premises with his authority.'
" *Id.* at 538 (ellipses and italics in original).

Conversely, other courts, such as those in Colorado, California, New
York, and Washington, have held that the terms "suffer," "permit," or
"allow" require actual or constructive knowledge. In *Full Moon Saloon,
Inc. v. City of Loveland,* the Colorado Court of Appeals held that a
statute making it unlawful to, among other things, "permit the sale,
serving, giving, or procuring of any alcohol beverage to or for a person
under the age of twenty-one years" required that "some level of
knowledge by the licensee must be established by the evidence." Ill P.3d
568, 569-70 (Colo.App.2005). The Court explained:

> The word "permit" connotes affirmative or knowing conduct. Thus,
> licensees and their employees and agents "permit" such conduct if they
> have actual knowledge of the violation or have constructive knowledge
> that it is occurring.
>
> Our conclusion that constructive knowledge of liquor code violations
> is sufficient to hold a licensee responsible for permitting the
> violation is consistent with cases from other jurisdictions.*\[Click
> here to see the cited cases.\]***\[ ... \]**

*Id.* at 570-71 (emphasis added).

Similarly, in *Laube v. Stroh,* the Court of Appeal of California
"h\[e\]ld that a licensee must have knowledge, either actual or
constructive, before he or she can be found to have 'permitted'
unacceptable conduct on a licensed premises.*\...*It defies logic to
charge someone with permitting conduct of which they are not aware."
*Id.* **\[ ... \]**

Considering the plain meaning of the words "suffer," "permit," and
"allow," we conclude that the use of those words in Rules 4.17 and 4.18
necessarily require that "some level of knowledge by the licensee must
be established by the evidence." **\[ ... \]**

We are fully cognizant of the strong public policy considerations behind
requiring a strict liability standard in the Liquor Board Rules.
Unlawful or immoral activities may be associated with places where
alcoholic beverages are sold. However, one of the primary purposes of
the Liquor Board Rules is to clearly inform licensees of their
responsibilities regarding prohibited activities so that they can
conform their conduct and the conduct of their businesses to be in
compliance with the Rules. Interpreting the words used in the Liquor
Board Rules at variance with their plain meaning does not advance the
public purpose of achieving compliance with the Rules. **\[ ...
\]**Accordingly, we hold that the Liquor Board erred in interpreting the
words "suffer," "permit," and "allow" in Rules 4.17 and 4.18 to impose a
strict liability standard on licensees.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd9178d681e90d9679336dbf75218ca5d638d828)

We also hold that the knowledge requirement implicit in the terms
"suffer," "permit," and "allow" can be satisfied by proof of either
actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the licensee. **\[ ...
\]**Actual knowledge is, of course, actual awareness of the prohibited
activity. Actual knowledge also includes the concept of "deliberate
ignorance" or "willful blindness." **\[ ... \]**In *State v. McCallum,*
Judge Chasanow explained the meaning of this form of knowledge in a
concurring opinion:

> There is more than one mental state that may constitute "knowledge."
> The first and highest form of "knowledge" is actual knowledge, that
> is, an actual awareness or an actual belief that a fact exists. A
> second form of "knowledge" is what has often been called "deliberate
> ignorance" or "willful blindness." R. Perkins, *Criminal Law,* Ch. 7,
> § 4 at 687 (1957). The latter form of "knowledge" exists where a
> person believes that it is probable that something is a fact, but
> deliberately shuts his or her eyes or avoids making reasonable inquiry
> with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth. **\[ ... \]** In
> *United States v. Jewell,* 532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.), **\[ ... \]** the
> 9th Circuit **\[ ... \]**quoted from Professor Glanville Williams'
> *Criminal Law: The General Part,* § 57 at 157, 159 (2d ed.1961), as
> follows:
>
> "To the requirement of actual knowledge there is one strictly limited
> exception\.... \[T\]he rule is that if a party has his suspicion
> aroused but then deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because
> he wishes to remain in ignorance, he is deemed to have
> knowledge\_\_\_\_The rule that wilful blindness is equivalent to
> knowledge is essential, and is found throughout the criminal law."

*Id.* at 700.

**\[ ... \]**

Constructive knowledge, however, implies knowledge where a licensee
should have known of the prohibited activity if reasonable care and
diligence had been exercised. **\[ ... \]**

The Colorado Court of Appeals explained constructive knowledge as
follows:

> Constructive knowledge may be inferred if the conduct occurs openly,
> such that a reasonable person would observe it. If knowledge of the
> prohibited conduct could have been obtained through the exercise of
> reasonable care and diligence, constructive knowledge may be inferred.
>
> Applying a constructive knowledge standard does not place an undue
> burden on the licensee because constructive knowledge requires only
> reasonable care and diligence and does not require extraordinary
> vigilance. Constructive knowledge means knowledge that one using
> reasonable care or diligence should have, and therefore that is
> attributed by law to a given person.

*Full Moon Saloon,* 111 P.3d at 570 (citations and internal quotation
marks omitted).

Nevertheless, the Liquor Board argues that Rule 4.17 is similar to Rule
4.01(a), which we held in *Hoyle* to impose strict liability. We
disagree.

Rule 4.01(a) provides: "No licensee shall sell or furnish alcoholic
beverages to any person under twenty-one (21) years of age or to any
person with the knowledge that such person is purchasing or acquiring
such beverages for consumption by any person under twenty-one (21) years
of age." *Hoyle,* **\[ ... \]** 692 A.2d 1. In *Hoyle,* the Liquor Board
ruled that Martini's Bar had violated Rule 4.01(a) when one of its
employees served alcohol to a minor. *Id.* at 128, 692 A.2d 1. Martini's
Bar appealed, arguing that this Court "should read a 'due caution'
provision into the \[R\]ule." *Id.* at 131, 692 A.2d 1. We declined to
do so, and instead held that the Rule "imposes strict liability for the
sale on the licensees." *Id.* at 133, 692 A.2d 1.

Our holding in *Hoyle* is clearly distinguishable from our holding in
the case *sub judice.* Rule 4.01(a), unlike Rule 4.17, does not use the
words "suffer," "permit," or "allow," which, as explained above,
necessarily include an element of knowledge. Instead, Rule 4.01(a) sets
forth a simple directive --- "No licensee shall sell or furnish \....",
which carries no implication of knowledge.

Finally, because the word "knowingly" appears in the second independent
clause ("second clause"), and not in the first independent clause
("first clause"), of Rule 4.17(b), the Liquor Board claims that such
sentence construction necessarily implies a strict liability standard in
the first clause. Again, we disagree.

To reiterate, Rule 4.17(b) states:

> No licensee shall permit or suffer any person to appear in any act or
> other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered; nor shall
> any licensee knowingly permit or suffer his premises to be used for
> the conduct, exhibition or performance of an obscene act or other
> performance.

The first clause clearly identifies the prohibited act --- any person
"appearing\] \... with breasts or the lower torso uncovered." On the
other hand, the second clause prohibits the performance of an "obscene
act or other performance." In our view, the word "knowingly" appears in
the second clause because an element of knowledge is required to
constitutionally regulate obscenity, a class of unprotected speech that
is not clearly defined in First Amendment jurisprudence. *See generally
Miller v. California,* 413 U.S. 15, 20**\[ ... \]** (1973) (summarizing
"the somewhat tortured history of the Court's obscenity decisions").

Accordingly, we hold that the Liquor Board erred in finding that Kougl
was guilty of violating Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), and 4.18, because there
was no evidence that Kougl had actual or constructive knowledge of his
employee's prohibited activity.

JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED. **\[ ... \]**

**^\[4\]^**4. The Alcoholic Beverages Rules and Regulations for the
Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City were updated in
2015 and effective as of January 1, 2016. The new rules that correspond
to old rules 4.17 and 4.18 are:

> Rule 4.15 --- Sexual Practices and Obscenity
>
> \(a\) A licensee may not permit the licensed premises to be used for
> any sexual activity. A licensee, any employee, patron or frequenter
> may not solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.
>
> \(b\) A licensee may not permit a person to appear in an act or other
> performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered. A licensee may
> not knowingly permit the licensed premises to be used for the conduct,
> exhibition, or any unlawful performance.
>
> \(c\) Section (b) of this rule does not apply to licensees that have a
> valid adult entertainment license issued by this Board.
>
> Rule 4.16 --- Illegal Conduct
>
> A licensee may not commit or allow the commission on the licensed
> premises of an act that is contrary to any federal, State or local
> statute, law or ordinance or that is against the public peace, safety,
> health, welfare, quiet, or morals.

The prior version of Rule 4.17 did not contain a subsection (c)

Notes & Questions (Kougl v. Board)

 

**Review Questions**

1.  What was the defendant\'s argument against the charges (regarding
    solicitation of prostitution and indecent exposure)? 

2.  Why did the prosecution believe the provisions ought to have been
    read as strict-liability provisions?   

3.  Recall *State v. Nations. *Does the court here adopt the same
    interpretation of the knowledge requirement? Could the State have
    shown D had constructive knowledge? Why was the argument not made? 

4.  Do you agree with the court's decision rejecting strict liability in
    this case? Consider cases in which the threat to public welfare is
    great, the cost of proving mental state is high, and the sanctions
    are minimal and not stigmatizing. When might it be worth it to
    require only strict liability? 

5.  Use the following statutes when answering the questions below
    regarding the Kougl case: 

> **Rule 4.15** --- Sexual Practices and Obscenity
>
> \(a\) A licensee may not permit the licensed premises to be used for
> any sexual activity. A licensee, any employee, patron or frequenter
> may not solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.
>
> \(b\) A licensee may not permit a person to appear in an act or other
> performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered. A licensee may
> not knowingly permit the licensed premises to be used for the conduct,
> exhibition, or any unlawful performance....
>
> **Rule 4.16** --- Illegal Conduct
>
> A licensee may not commit or allow the commission on the licensed
> premises of an act that is contrary to any federal, State or local
> statute, law or ordinance or that is against the public peace, safety,
> health, welfare, quiet, or morals.

1.  What was D's defense against the charges that his establishment
    violated rules regarding solicitation of prostitution and indecent
    exposure? 

2.  Explain the Prosecution's argument for why these provisions ought to
    be read as "Strict Liability" provisions. 

3.  Use the statute below, cited by the state, to bolster your
    argument: 

> ***Rule 4.01** -- Minors (a) Sales to Minors - No licensee shall sell,
> furnish, or allow to be furnished by his/her agent or employee
> alcoholic beverages to any person under twenty-one (21) years of age
> or to any person with the knowledge that such person is purchasing or
> acquiring such beverages for consumption by any person under
> twenty-one (21) years of age. *

          Explain how State asked the court to interpret 4.15 (below),
given its interpretation of 4.01: 

> **Rule 4.15** --- Sexual Practices and Obscenity
>
> \(a\) A licensee may not permit the licensed premises to be used for
> any sexual activity. A licensee, any employee, patron or frequenter
> may not solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.
>
> \(b\) A licensee may not permit a person to appear in an act or other
> performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered. A licensee may
> not knowingly permit the licensed premises to be used for the conduct,

**Problem: Kougl and Strict Liability**

Ever since a closed-head injury left her with chronic pain, Diana has
become a frequent user of painkillers. When her original prescriptions
ran out, she began buying the drugs illegally from local dealers. Like
many women, for years she has carried pepper spray (a tear gas spray) in
her purse in the hopes that it would protect her in the event of a
sexual assault. It's been at the bottom of her purse for so long that
she'd forgotten about it. Last month, police arrested her attempting to
buy  drugs from an undercover officer. When they searched her purse and
found the pepper spray, in addition to the drug-related charge, she was
charged with the crime below, a misdemeanor which may add time to her
sentence. The relevant statute is as follows: 

> **CA Penal Code Chap. 1, 22810. **Notwithstanding any other provision
> of law, any person may purchase, possess, or use tear gas or any tear
> gas weapon for the projection or release of tear gas if the tear gas
> or tear gas weapon is used solely for self-defense purposes, subject
> to the following requirements:
>
> ... (b) No person addicted to any narcotic drug shall purchase,
> possess, or use tear gas or any tear gas weapon. 

Assume that Diana hires you as her defense attorney. Answer the
following questions: 

1\) Assuming that Diana is found to be addicted to painkillers
(narcotics), explain the State's case against her.  

2\) Which of the following, assuming the jury believes Diana, might
provide a defense? 

-   Her testimony that she did not know she possessed pepper spray.

-   Her testimony that she did not know she was an addict

-   Her testimony that she did not know about the law against addicts
    possessing pepper spray.

-   Her testimony that she was not negligent in carrying pepper spray
    because breaking the law was not unreasonable under the
    circumstances.

3\) Reconsider the justifications for and against strict liability laws,
and articulate the case for and against convicting Diana. 

4\) Can you reconcile the outcome you predict in Diana's case with the
outcome in Kougl? Explain.

People v. Navarro

 

Appellate Department, Superior Court, Los Angeles

People v. Navarro

99 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 1

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

DOWDS, J.

Defendant, charged with a violation of Penal Code section 487,
subdivision 1, grand theft, appeals his conviction after a jury trial of
petty theft, a lesser but necessarily included offense. His contention
on appeal is that the jury was improperly instructed. The only facts
**\[ ... \]** set forth in the record on appeal are that defendant was
charged with stealing four wooden beams from a construction site and
that the state of the evidence was such that the jury could have found
that the defendant believed either (1) that the beams had been abandoned
as worthless and the owner had no objection to his taking them or (2)
that they had substantial value, had not been abandoned and he had no
right to take them.

The court refused two jury instructions proposed by defendant reading as
follows:

Defendant\'s A

\"If one takes personal property with the good faith belief that the
property has been abandoned or discarded by the true owner, he is not
guilty of theft. This is the case even if such good faith belief is
unreasonable. The prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
the defendant did not so believe for you to convict a defendant of
theft.\"

Defendant\'s B

\"If one takes personal property with the good faith belief that he has
permission to take the property, he is not guilty of theft. This is the
case even if such good faith belief is unreasonable.

The prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
did not so believe for you to convict a defendant of theft.\"

Instead, the court instructed the jury in the words of the following
modified instructions:

Modified-Defendant\'s A

\"If one takes personal property in the reasonable and good faith belief
that the property has been abandoned or discarded by the true owner, he
is not guilty of theft.\"

Modified-Defendant\'s B

\"If one takes personal property in the reasonable and good faith belief
that he has the consent or permission of the owner to take the property,
he is not guilty of theft. **\[ ... \]**

\"If you have a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the required
criminal intent as specified in these instructions, the defendant is
entitled to an acquittal.\"

Accordingly, the question for determination on appeal is whether the
defendant should be acquitted if there is a reasonable doubt that he had
a good faith belief that the property had been abandoned or that he had
the permission of the owner to take the property or whether that belief
must be a reasonable one as well as being held in good faith.

**\[ ... \]**

Evidence was presented**\[ ... \]** from which the jury could have
concluded that defendant believed that the wooden beams had been
abandoned and that the owner had no objection to his taking them, i.e.,
**\[ ... \]**that he lacked the specific criminal intent required to
commit the crime of theft (intent permanently to deprive an owner of his
property). A similar situation existed in *People v. Photo* (1941)**\[
... \]**, where defendant\'s conviction of grand theft for the taking of
certain boxes of oranges which he thought he had purchased was
reversed**\[ ... \]**

Earlier California cases are to the same effect. In *People v. Devine*
(1892) **\[ ... \]**, defendant\'s conviction of larceny was reversed.
He had driven away in a wagon, without any attempt at secrecy, a number
of hogs, his own and three bearing another\'s mark or brand. The Supreme
Court pointed out: \"There are cases in which all the knowledge which a
person might have acquired by due diligence is to be imputed to him. But
where a felonious intent must be proven, it can be done only by proving
what the accused knew. One cannot intend to steal property which he
believes to be his own. He may be careless, and omit to make an effort
to ascertain that the property which he thinks his own belongs to
another; but so long as he believes it to be his own, he cannot
feloniously steal it \...\" (*Id.* at pp. 230-231.)

**\[ ... \]**

Cases in other jurisdictions also hold that where the law requires a
specific criminal intent, it is not enough merely to prove that a
reasonable man would have had that intent, without meeting the burden of
proof that the defendant himself also entertained it. For example, in
*State v. Ebbeller* (1920)**\[ ... \]**, a conviction of knowingly
receiving a stolen automobile was reversed because the court gave the
following erroneous jury instruction: \"\'By the term \"knowing\" that
the property was stolen is not meant absolute personal and certain
knowledge on the part of the defendant that the property mentioned in
the indictment had been stolen, but such knowledge and information in
his possession at the time he received the same, if you believe he did
receive it, as would put a reasonably prudent man, exercising ordinary
caution, on his guard, and would cause such a man exercising such
caution, **\[ ... \]**and under circumstances which you believe
defendant received the property, to believe and be satisfied that the
property had been stolen.\'\" (222 S.W. at p. 397.)

In reversing, the court pointed out the error in the instruction as
follows: \"It will be noticed that the instruction does permit a
conviction if the facts were such as (in the opinion of the jury) would
have caused a reasonably prudent person, exercising ordinary caution, to
have believed that the property had been stolen at the time received.

\"We are inclined to the view \... that the learned attorney
representing the appellant is correct in stating that\--\"\'The question
is not what some other person would have believed and known from the
circumstances attending the receipt of the property, but what did this
defendant believe and know.\'\" *(Id.*)

**\[ ... \]**

La Fave and Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law (1972) sets forth at page
357 what the authors call the \"\...rather simple rule that an honest
mistake of fact or law is a defense when it negates a required mental
element of the crime \...\" As an example they refer to the crime of
receiving stolen property, stating \"\...if the defendant by a mistake
of either fact or law did not know the goods were stolen, even though
the circumstances would have led a prudent man to believe they were
stolen, he does not have the required mental state and thus may not be
convicted of the crime.\"

**\[ ... \]** In the instant case the trial court in effect instructed
the jury that even though defendant in good faith believed he had the
right to **\[ ... \]** take the beams, and thus lacked the specific
intent required for the crime of theft, he should be convicted unless
such belief was reasonable. In doing so it erred. fn. 2 It is true that
if the jury thought the defendant\'s belief to be unreasonable, it might
infer that he did not in good faith hold such belief. If, however, it
concluded that defendant in good faith believed that he had the right to
take the beams, even though such belief was unreasonable as measured by
the objective standard of a hypothetical reasonable man, defendant was
entitled to an acquittal since the specific intent required to be proved
as an element of the offense had not been established. fn. 3

The People\'s reliance on *People v. Mayberry* (1975)**\[ ... \]** is
misplaced. The discussion in that case involved the propriety of an
instruction on mistake of fact in respect of charges of rape and
kidnaping, general intent crimes, a different question from that here
presented.

The judgment is reversed.

Cole, P. J., and Saeta, J., concurred.

FN 1. Wetmore had occupied an apartment in the owner\'s absence and used
or destroyed some of the contents, allegedly in the good faith but
unreasonable belief, induced by mental illness, that he owned the
apartment and its contents.

FN 2. The portion of the court\'s instruction reading \"If you have a
reasonable doubt that the defendant had the required criminal intent
\... the defendant is entitled to an acquittal\" is, however, correct.

FN 3. Instruction No. 4.35 in the fourth edition of California Jury
Instructions\--Criminal, relating to ignorance or mistake of fact, reads
as follows: \"An act committed or an omission made under an ignorance or
mistake of fact which disproves any criminal intent is not a crime.

\"Thus a person is not guilty of a crime if he commits an act or omits
to act under an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of certain
facts and circumstances which, if true, would make such act or omission
lawful.\" The use note for this instruction omits the caveat found under
instruction No. 4.36, relating to ignorance or mistake of law, to the
effect that the instruction would be inappropriate if the mistake may
negative a specific intent or other mental state which the crime
requires. We think trial judges would be well advised also to eschew or
modify instruction No. 4.35 in cases involving crimes requiring a
specific intent or mental state.

OPINION RICHARDSON, J.

Defendant Neva Snyder appeals from a judgment convicting her of
possession of a concealable firearm by a convicted felon (Pen. Code, §
12021), based upon her 1973 conviction for sale of marijuana, a felony
(former Health & Saf. Code, § 11531). Defendant contends that the trial
court erred in excluding evidence of her mistaken belief that her prior
conviction was only a misdemeanor. We will conclude that defendant\'s
asserted mistake regarding her legal status as a convicted **\[ ... \]**
felon did not constitute a defense to the firearm possession charge.
Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment.

At trial, defendant offered to prove the following facts supporting her
theory of mistake: The marijuana possession charge resulted from a plea
bargain not involving a jail or prison sentence. At the time the bargain
was struck, defendant\'s attorney advised her that she was pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor. Believing that she was not a felon, defendant
thereafter had registered to vote, and had voted. On one prior occasion,
police officers found a gun in her home but, after determining that it
was registered to her husband, the officers filed no charges against
defendant.

The trial court refused to admit any evidence of defendant\'s mistaken
belief that her prior conviction was a misdemeanor and that she was not
a felon. The court also rejected proposed instructions requiring proof
of defendant\'s prior knowledge of her felony conviction as an element
of the offense charged.

Penal Code section 12021, subdivision (a), provides: \"Any person who
has been convicted of a felony under the laws of the \... State of
California \... who owns or has in his possession or under his custody
or control any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being
concealed upon the person is guilty of a public offense, \...\"

\[1\] The elements of the offense proscribed by section 12021 are
conviction of a felony and ownership, possession, custody or control of
a firearm capable of being concealed on the person.**\[ ... \]** No
specific criminal intent is required, and a general intent to commit the
proscribed act is sufficient to sustain a conviction. **\[ ... \]** With
respect to the elements of possession or custody, it has been held that
knowledge is an element of the offense. **\[ ... \]**

\[2\] Does section 12021 also require knowledge of one\'s legal status
as a convicted felon? No case has so held. Penal Code section 26
provides that a person is incapable of committing a crime if he acted
under a \"mistake of fact\" which disproves criminal intent. In this
regard, the cases have distinguished between mistakes of fact and
mistakes of law. As we stated in an early case: \"It is an emphatic
postulate of both civil and penal law that**\[ ... \]** ignorance of a
law is no excuse for a violation thereof. Of course it is based on a
fiction, because no man can know all the law, but it is a maxim which
the law itself does not permit any one to gainsay \.... The rule rests
on public necessity; the welfare of society and the safety of the state
depend upon its enforcement. If a person accused of a crime could shield
himself behind the defense that he was ignorant of the law which he
violated, immunity from punishment would in most cases result.\" **\[
... \]**Accordingly, lack of actual knowledge of the provisions of Penal
Code section 12021 is irrelevant; the crucial question is whether the
defendant was aware that he was engaging in the conduct proscribed by
that section. **\[ ... \]**

In the present case, defendant was presumed to know that it is unlawful
for a convicted felon to possess a concealable firearm. (Pen. Code, §
12021.) She was also charged with knowledge that the offense of which
she was convicted (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11531) was, as a matter
of law, a felony. That section had prescribed a state prison term of
from five years to life, and the express statutory definition of a
\"felony\" is \"a crime which is punishable with death or by
imprisonment in the state prison.\" (Pen. Code, § 17, subd. (a).)

Thus, regardless of what she reasonably believed, or what her attorney
may have told her, defendant was deemed to know under the law that she
was a convicted felon forbidden to possess concealable firearms. Her
asserted mistake regarding her correct legal status was a mistake of
law, not fact. It does not constitute a defense to section 12021.

None of the California cases relied on by defendant is apposite here.
*People v. Hernandez* (1964)**\[ ... \]** and *People v. Mayberry*
(1975)**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** each involved mistakes of fact, not law. In
*Hernandez*, the mistake concerned the age of the alleged victim of a
statutory rape. In Mayberry, defendant erred in assuming that the adult
victim of forcible rape consented to his acts. *People v. Vogel* (1956)
[**\[ ...
\]**](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/2d/46/798.html),
involved the good faith belief of a defendant charged with bigamy that
he is free to remarry. We were careful to explain that defendant\'s
mistake was a factual one: \"We have concluded that defendant is not
guilty of bigamy, if he had a bona fide and reasonable belief that facts
existed that left him free to remarry.\" (Id., at p. 801**\[ ... \]**)
Moreover, *Vogel* characterized bigamy as a crime which \"has been
regarded for centuries as \... involving moral turpitude, \...\"
Obviously a bona fide belief that one is free to remarry nullifies the
moral opprobrium attached to the charge. On the other hand, being an
ex-felon in possession of a concealable firearm, while illegal, hardly
stamps the person charged as a moral leper. His belief that he is not a
felon thus does not affect the criminality of his conduct.

**\[ ... \]**

We conclude that the trial court properly excluded evidence of
defendant\'s asserted mistake regarding her status as a convicted felon.

The judgment is affirmed.

Bird, C. J., Mosk J. and Kaus, J. concurred.

BROUSSARD, J.

I dissent.

The two elements of a violation of Penal Code section 12021 are felony
status and possession of a concealable firearm. While no specific
criminal intent is required, a general criminal intent should be
required as to both elements in accordance with long-settled rules of
statutory interpretation, and an honest and reasonable mistake as to
either element of the offense, however induced, should negate the
requisite general criminal intent. Defendant\'s testimony if believed
would have established an honest and reasonable mistaken belief that her
prior offense was not a felony but a misdemeanor, and it was prejudicial
error to refuse to admit the evidence and to refuse instructions on the
mistake doctrine.

The majority have adopted a special strict liability rule as to section
12021, holding that a felon is charged with knowledge of his status and
that an honest and reasonable mistaken belief as to the nature of the
conviction is not a defense unless apparently it is induced or
corroborated in whole or in part by governmental conduct. The
traditional and longstanding defense of mistake negating criminal intent
should not be limited to situations where the mistake is induced or
corroborated by government officials.**\[ ... \]**

United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943)

 

 

Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\
This was a prosecution begun by two informations, consolidated for
trial, charging Buffalo Pharmacal Company, Inc., and Dotterweich, its
president and general manager, with violations of the Act of Congress of
June 25, 1938, 52 Stat. 1040, 21 U.S.C. §§301-392, known as the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Company, a jobber in drugs, purchased
them from their manufacturers and shipped them, repacked under its own
label, in interstate commerce. . . . The informations were based on §301
of that Act (21 U.S.C. §331), paragraph (a) of which prohibits "The
introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of
any . . . drug . . . that is adulterated or misbranded." "Any person"
violating this provision is, by paragraph (a) of §303 (21 U.S.C. §333),
made "guilty of a misdemeanor." Three counts went to the jury --- two,
for shipping misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, and a third, for
so shipping an adulterated drug. The jury disagreed as to the
corporation and found Dotterweich guilty on all three counts. . . . The
Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the conviction
on the ground that only the corporation was the "person" subject to
prosecution. . . .

. . . The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was an exertion by Congress of its
power to keep impure and adulterated food and drugs out of the channels
of commerce. By the Act of 1938, Congress extended the range of its
control over illicit and noxious articles and stiffened the penalties
for disobedience. The purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of
the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern
industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these
purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be
treated as a working instrument of government. . . . The prosecution to
which Dotterweich was subjected is based on a now familiar type of
legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means of regulation.
Such legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement for
criminal conduct --- awareness of some wrongdoing. In the interest of
the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person
otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public
danger. United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250. And so it is clear that
shipments like those now in issue are "punished by the statute if the
article is misbranded \[or adulterated\], and that the article may be
misbranded \[or adulterated\] without any conscious fraud at all. It was
natural enough to throw this risk on shippers with regard to the
identity of their wares. . . ." United States v. Johnson, 221 U.S. 488,
497-98.

The statute makes "any person" who violates §301(a) guilty of a
"misdemeanor." It specifically defines "person" to include
"corporation." §201(e). But the only way in which a corporation can act
is through the individuals who act on its behalf. And the historic
conception of a "misdemeanor" makes all those responsible for it equally
guilty. . . . If, then, Dotterweich is not subject to the Act, it must
be solely on the ground that individuals are immune when the "person"
who violates §301(a) is a corporation, although from the point of view
of action the individuals are the corporation. . . . To hold that the
Act of 1938 freed all individuals, except when proprietors, from the
culpability under which the earlier legislation had placed them is to
defeat the very object of the new Act. Nothing is clearer than that the
later legislation was designed to enlarge and stiffen the penal net and
not to narrow and loosen it. This purpose was unequivocally avowed by
the two committees which reported the bills to the Congress. The House
Committee reported that the Act "seeks to set up effective provisions
against abuses of consumer welfare growing out of inadequacies in the
Food and Drugs Act. . . ." (H. Rep. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., at
1.) And the Senate Committee explicitly pointed out that the new
legislation "must not weaken the existing laws," but on the contrary "it
must strengthen and extend that law's protection of the consumer." (S.
Rep. No. 152, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1.) . . .

. . . Hardship there doubtless may be under a statute which thus
penalizes the transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally
wanting. Balancing relative hardships, Congress has preferred to place
it upon those who have at least the opportunity of informing themselves
of the existence of conditions imposed for the protection of consumers
before sharing in illicit commerce, rather than to throw the hazard on
the innocent public who are wholly helpless.

It would be too treacherous to define or even to indicate by way of
illustration the class of employees which stands in such a responsible
relation. To attempt a formula embracing the variety of conduct whereby
persons may responsibly contribute in furthering a transaction forbidden
by an Act of Congress, to wit, to send illicit goods across state lines,
would be mischievous futility. In such matters the good sense of
prosecutors, the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate
judgment of juries must be trusted. Our system of criminal justice
necessarily depends on "conscience and circumspection in prosecuting
officers," Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 378, even when the
consequences are far more drastic than they are under the provision of
law before us. See United States v. Balint, supra (involving a maximum
sentence of five years). For present purpose it suffices to say that . .
. the District Court properly left the question of the responsibility of
Dotterweich for the shipment to the jury, and there was sufficient
evidence to support its verdict. . . .

Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.

. . . There is no evidence in this case of any personal guilt on the
part of the respondent. There is no proof or claim that he ever knew of
the introduction into commerce of the adulterated drugs in question,
much less that he actively participated in their introduction. Guilt is
imputed to the respondent solely on the basis of his authority and
responsibility as president and general manager of the corporation.

It is a fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence that guilt is
personal and that it ought not lightly to be imputed to a citizen who,
like the respondent, has no evil intention or consciousness of
wrongdoing. It may be proper to charge him with responsibility to the
corporation and the stockholders for negligence and mismanagement. But
in the absence of clear statutory authorization it is inconsistent with
established canons of criminal law to rest liability on an act in which
the accused did not participate and of which he had no personal
knowledge. Before we place the stigma of a criminal conviction upon any
such citizen the legislative mandate must be clear and unambiguous. . .
.

. . . To erect standards of responsibility is a difficult legislative
task and the opinion of this Court admits that it is "too treacherous"
and a "mischievous futility" for us to engage in such pursuits. But the
only alternative is a blind resort to "the good sense of prosecutors,
the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate judgment of juries."
Yet that situation is precisely what our constitutional system sought to
avoid. . . . The legislative power to restrain the liberty and to
imperil the good reputation of citizens must not rest upon the variable
attitudes and opinions of those charged with the duties of interpreting
and enforcing the mandates of the law. I therefore cannot approve the
decision of the Court in this case.

United States v. Balint

 

United States Supreme Court

258 U.S. 250 (1922)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the court.

Defendants in error were indicted for a violation of the Narcotic Act of
December 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785. The indictment charged them with
unlawfully selling to another a certain amount of a derivative of opium
and a certain amount of a derivative of coca leaves, not in pursuance of
any written order on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, contrary to the provisions of § 2 of
the act. The defendants demurrer to the indictment on the ground that it
failed to charge that they had sold the inhibited drugs knowing them to
be such. The statute does not make such knowledge an element of the
offense. The District Court sustained the demurrer and quashed the
indictment. The correctness of this ruling is the question before us.

While the general rule at common law was that the *scienter* was a
necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this
was followed in regard to statutory crimes even where the statutory
definition did not in terms include it, there has been a modification of
this view in respect to prosecutions under statutes the purpose of which
would be obstructed by such a requirement. It is a question of
legislative intent to be construed by the court. It has been objected
that punishment of a person for an act in violation of law when ignorant
of the facts making it so, is an absence of due process of law. But that
objection is considered and overruled in *Shevlin-Carpenter Co.* v.
*Minnesota,* 218 U.S. 57, 69, 70 \[1910\], in which it was held that in
the prohibition or punishment of particular acts, the State may in the
maintenance of a public policy provide \"that he who shall do them shall
do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good
faith or ignorance.\" Many instances of this are to be found in
regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power
where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some
social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases
of *mala in se*. So, too, in the collection of taxes, the importance to
the public of their collection leads the legislature to impose on the
taxpayer the burden of finding out the facts upon which his liability to
pay depends and meeting it at the peril of punishment. Again where one
deals with others and his mere negligence may be dangerous to them, as
in selling diseased food or poison, the policy of the law may, in order
to stimulate proper care, require the punishment of the negligent person
though he be ignorant of the noxious character of what he sells.

The question before us, therefore, is one of the construction of the
statute and of inference of the intent of Congress. The Narcotic Act has
been held by this court to be a taxing act with the incidental purpose
of minimizing the spread of addiction to the use of poisonous and
demoralizing drugs.

Section 2 of the Narcotic Act, 38 Stat. 786, we give in part in the
margin.^\[1\]^ It is very evident from a reading of  it that the
emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the
business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of
the Government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure
recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing
and restraining the traffic. Its manifest purpose is to require every
person dealing in drugs to ascertain at his peril whether that which he
sells comes within the inhibition of the statute, and if he sells the
inhibited drug in ignorance of its character, to penalize him. Congress
weighed the possible injustice of subjecting an innocent seller to a
penalty against the evil of exposing innocent purchasers to danger from
the drug, and concluded that the latter was the result preferably to be
avoided. Doubtless considerations as to the opportunity of the seller to
find out the fact and the difficulty of proof of knowledge contributed
to this conclusion. We think the demurrer to the indictment should have
been overruled.

*Judgment reversed.*

\[1\]

Sec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter,
exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of
a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered,
exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Every person who shall accept any
such order, and in pursuance thereof shall sell, barter, exchange, or
give away any of the aforesaid drugs, shall preserve such order for a
period of two years in such a way as to be readily accessible to
inspection by any officer, agent, or employee of the Treasury Department
duly authorized for that purpose, and the State, Territorial, District,
municipal, and insular officials named in section five of this Act.
Every person who shall give an order as herein provided to any other
person for any of the aforesaid drugs shall, at or before the time of
giving such order, make or cause to be made a duplicate thereof on a
form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, and in case of the acceptance of such order, shall
preserve such duplicate for said period of two years in such a way as to
be readily accessible to inspection by the officers, agents, employees,
and officials hereinbefore mentioned.

 

 

 

Morissette v. United States

 

Supreme Court of the United States

**Morissette v. United States**

342 U.S. 246

**\[ ... \]**

No. 12

1952-01-07

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

This would have remained a profoundly insignificant case to all except
its immediate parties had it not been so tried and submitted to the jury
as to raise questions both fundamental and far-reaching in federal
criminal law, for which reason we granted certiorari.

On a large tract of uninhabited and untilled land in a wooded and
sparsely populated area of Michigan, the Government established a
practice bombing range over which the Air Force dropped simulated bombs
at ground targets. These bombs consisted of a metal cylinder about forty
inches long and eight inches across, filled with sand and enough black
powder to cause a smoke puff by which the strike could be located. At
various places about the range, signs read \"Danger \-- Keep Out \--
Bombing Range.\" Nevertheless, the range was known as good deer country,
and was extensively hunted.

Spent bomb casings were cleared from the targets and thrown into piles
\"so that they will be out of the way.\" They were not sacked or piled
in any order, but were dumped in heaps, some of which had been
accumulating for four years or upwards, were exposed to the weather and
rusting away.

Morissette, in December of 1948, went hunting in this area but did not
get a deer. He thought to meet expenses of the trip by salvaging some of
these casings. He loaded three tons of them on his truck and took them
to a nearby farm, where they were flattened by driving a tractor over
them. After expending this labor and trucking them to market in Flint,
he realized \$84.

Morissette, by occupation, is a fruit stand operator in summer and a
trucker and scrap iron collector in winter. An honorably discharged
veteran of World War II, he enjoys a good name among his neighbors and
has had no blemish on his record more disreputable than a conviction for
reckless driving.

The loading, crushing and transporting of these casings were all in
broad daylight, in full view of passers-by, without the slightest effort
at concealment. When an investigation was started, Morissette
voluntarily, promptly and candidly told the whole story to the
authorities, saying that he had no intention of stealing. but thought
the property was abandoned, unwanted and considered of no value to the
Government. He was indicted**\[ ... \]**on the charge that he \"did
unlawfully, wilfully and knowingly steal and convert\" property of the
United States of the value of \$84, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641,
which provides that \"whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly
converts\" government property is punishable by fine and
imprisonment.**\[ ... \]** Morissette was convicted and sentenced to
imprisonment for two months or to pay a fine of \$200. The Court of
Appeals affirmed**\[ ... \]**

On his trial, Morissette, as he had at all times told investigating
officers, testified that, from appearances, he believed the casings were
cast-off and abandoned, that he did not intend to steal the property,
and took it with no wrongful or criminal intent. The trial court,
however, was unimpressed, and ruled: \"\[H\]e took it because he thought
it was abandoned and he knew he was on government property. . . . That
is no defense. . . . I don\'t think anybody can have the defense they
thought the property was abandoned on another man\'s piece of
property.\" The court stated: \"I will not permit you to show this man
thought it was abandoned. . . . I hold in this case that there is no
question of abandoned property.\" The court refused to submit or to
allow counsel to argue to the jury whether Morissette acted with
innocent intention. **\[ ... \]**The question on intent is whether or
not he intended to take the property. He says he did. Therefore, if you
believe either side, he is guilty.\" Petitioner\'s counsel contended,
\"But the taking must have been with a felonious intent.\" The court
ruled, however: \"That is presumed by his own act.\"

The Court of Appeals *\[affirmed\].* This conclusion was thought to be
required by the failure of Congress to express such a requisite and this
Court\'s decisions in *United States v. Behrman,* [258 U.
S.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/258/280/case.html)
[280](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/258/280/case.html),
and *United States v. Balint,* [258 U. S.
250](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/258/250/case.html).

**I**

In those cases, this Court did construe mere omission from a criminal
enactment of any mention of criminal intent as dispensing with it. If
they be deemed precedents for principles of construction generally
applicable to federal penal statutes, they authorize this conviction.
Indeed, such adoption of the literal reasoning announced in those cases
would do this and more \-- it would sweep out of all federal crimes,
except when expressly preserved, the ancient requirement of a culpable
state of mind. We think a resume of their historical background is
convincing that an effect has been ascribed to them more comprehensive
than was contemplated and one inconsistent with our philosophy of
criminal law.

The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted
by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universal
and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the
human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to
choose between good and evil. A relation between some mental element and
punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the child\'s
familiar exculpatory \"But I didn\'t mean to,\" and has afforded the
rational basis for a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence and
reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as the motivation for
public prosecution. Unqualified acceptance of this doctrine by English
common law in the Eighteenth Century was indicated by Blackstone\'s
sweeping statement that to constitute any crime there must first be a
\"vicious will.\" Common law commentators of the Nineteenth Century
early pronounced the same principle**\[ ... \]**

Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from
concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand, was
congenial to an intense individualism and took deep and early root in
American soil. As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if
their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that
the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle, but merely
recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that
it required no statutory affirmation. Courts, with little hesitation or
division, found an implication of the requirement as to offenses that
were taken over from the common law. The unanimity with which they have
adhered to the central thought that wrongdoing must be conscious to be
criminal is emphasized by the variety, disparity and confusion of their
definitions of the requisite but elusive mental element. However, courts
of various jurisdictions, and for the purposes of different offenses,
have devised working formulae**\[ ... \]**for the instruction of juries
around such terms as \"felonious intent,\" \"criminal intent,\" \"malice
aforethought,\" \"guilty knowledge,\" \"fraudulent intent,\"
\"willfulness,\" \"scienter,\" to denote guilty knowledge, or \"*mens
rea,*\" to signify an evil purpose or mental culpability. *\[They\]*have
sought to protect those who were not blameworthy in mind from conviction
of infamous common law crimes.

However, the *Balint* and *Behrman* offenses belong to a category of
another character, with very different antecedents and origins. The
crimes there involved depend on no mental element, but consist only of
forbidden acts or omissions. This, while not expressed by the Court, is
made clear from examination of a century-old but accelerating tendency,
discernible both here and in England, to call into existence new duties
and crimes which disregard any ingredient of intent. The industrial
revolution multiplied the number of workmen exposed to injury from
increasingly powerful and complex mechanisms, driven by freshly
discovered sources of energy, requiring higher precautions by employers.
Traffic of velocities, volumes and varieties unheard of came to subject
the wayfarer to intolerable casualty risks if owners and drivers were
not to observe new cares and uniformities of conduct. Congestion of
cities and crowding of quarters called for health and welfare
regulations undreamed of in simpler times. Wide distribution of goods
became an instrument of wide distribution of harm when those who
dispersed food, drink, drugs, and even securities, did not comply with
reasonable standards of quality, integrity, disclosure and care. Such
dangers have engendered increasingly numerous and detailed regulations
which heighten the duties of those in control of particular industries,
trades, properties or activities that affect public health, safety or
welfare.

While many of these duties are sanctioned by a more strict civil
liability, lawmakers, whether wisely or not, have sought to make such
regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to be applied
by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and convictions. This
has confronted the courts with a multitude of prosecutions, based on
statutes or administrative regulations, for what have been aptly called
\"public welfare offenses.\" These cases do not fit neatly into any of
such accepted classifications of common law offenses, such as those
against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these
offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions,
with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of
neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a
duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or
immediate injury to person or property, but merely create the danger or
probability of it which the law seeks to minimize. While such offenses
do not threaten the security of the state in the manner of treason, they
may be regarded as offenses against its authority, for their occurrence
impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social order
as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the intent of the
violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or
not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such
offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary
element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a
position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably
expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who
assumed his responsibilities. Also, penalties commonly are relatively
small, and conviction does not grave damage to an offender\'s
reputation. Under such considerations, courts have turned to construing
statutes and regulations which make no mention of intent as dispensing
with it and holding that the guilty act alone makes out the crime. This
has not, however, been without expressions of misgiving**\[ ... \]**

In overruling a contention that there can be no conviction on an
indictment which makes no charge of criminal intent but alleges only
making of a sale of a narcotic forbidden by law, Chief Justice Taft,
wrote:

\"While the general rule at common law was that the *scienter* was a
necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this
was followed in regard to statutory crimes even where the statutory
definition did not, in terms, include it . . . , there has been a
modification of this view in respect to prosecutions under statutes the
purpose of which would be obstructed by such a requirement. It is a
question of legislative intent to be construed by the court. . . .\"

*United States v. Balint, supra,* [258 U. S.
251](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/258/250/case.html#251)-252.

He referred, however, to

\"regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power
where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some
social betterment, rather than the punishment of the crimes, as in cases
of *mala in se,*\"

and drew his citation of supporting authority chiefly from state court
cases dealing with regulatory offenses. *Id.* at [258 U. S.
252](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/258/250/case.html#252).

On the same day, the Court determined that an offense under the Narcotic
Drug Act does not require intent, saying,

\"If the offense be a statutory one, and intent or knowledge is not made
an element of it, the indictment need not charge such knowledge or
intent.\"

*United States v. Behrman, supra,* at [258 U. S.
288](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/258/280/case.html#288).

Of course, the purpose of every statute would be \"obstructed\" by
requiring a finding of intent, if we assume that it had a purpose to
convict without it. Therefore, the obstruction rationale does not help
us to learn the purpose of the omission by Congress. And since no
federal crime can exist except by force of statute, the reasoning of the
*Behrman* opinion, if read literally, would work far-reaching changes in
the composition of all federal crimes. **\[ ... \]**

It was not until recently that the Court took occasion more explicitly
to relate abandonment of the ingredient of intent not merely with
considerations of expediency in obtaining convictions, nor with the
*malum prohibitum*classification of the crime, but with the peculiar
nature and quality of the offense. We referred to \" . . . a now
familiar type of legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means
of regulation\", and continued,

\"such legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement for
criminal conduct \-- awareness of some wrongdoing. In the interest of
the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person
otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public
danger.\"

But we warned: \"Hardship there doubtless may be under a statute which
thus penalizes the transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be
totally wanting.\" *United States v. Dotterweich,* [320 U. S.
277](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/320/277/case.html),
[320 U. S.
280](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/320/277/case.html#280)-281,
[320 U. S.
284](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/320/277/case.html#284). 

Neither this Court nor, so far as we are aware, any other has undertaken
to delineate a precise line or set forth comprehensive criteria for
distinguishing between crimes that require a mental element and crimes
that do not. We attempt no closed definition, for the law on the subject
is neither settled nor static. The conclusion reached in the *Balint*
and *Behrman* cases has our approval and adherence for the circumstances
to which it was there applied. A quite different question here is
whether we will expand the doctrine of crimes without intent to include
those charged here.

Stealing, larceny, and its variants and equivalents were among the
earliest offenses known to the law that existed before legislation; they
are invasions of rights of property which stir a sense of insecurity in
the whole community and arouse public demand for retribution, the
penalty is high and, when a sufficient amount is involved, the infamy is
that of a felony, which, says Maitland, is \". . . as bad a word as you
can give to man or thing.\" State courts of last resort, on whom fall
the heaviest burden of interpreting criminal law in this country, have
consistently retained the requirement of intent in larceny-type
offenses. **\[ ... \]**

Congress, therefore, omitted any express prescription of criminal intent
from the enactment before us in the light of an unbroken course of
judicial decision in all constituent states of the Union holding intent
inherent in this class of offense, even when not expressed in a statute.
Congressional silence as to mental elements in an Act merely adopting
into federal statutory law a concept of crime already so well defined in
common law and statutory interpretation by the states may warrant quite
contrary inferences than the same silence in creating an offense new to
general law, for whose definition the courts have no guidance except the
Act. Because the offenses before this Court in the *Balint* and
*Behrman*cases were of this latter class, we cannot accept them as
authority for eliminating intent from offenses incorporated from the
common law. **\[ ... \]**

We hold that mere omission from § 641 of any mention of intent will not
be construed as eliminating that element from the crimes denounced.

**II**

**\[ ... \]**

Congress, by the language of this section, has been at pains to
incriminate only \"knowing\" conversions. **\[ ... \]**

Had the statute applied to conversions without qualification, it would
have made crimes of all unwitting, inadvertent and unintended
conversions. Knowledge, of course, is not identical with intent, and may
not have been the most apt words of limitation. But knowing
conversion requires more than knowledge that defendant was taking the
property into his possession. He must have had knowledge of the facts,
though not necessarily the law, that made the taking a conversion. In
the case before us, **\[ ... \]**it is not apparent how Morissette could
have knowingly or intentionally converted property that he did not know
could be converted, as would be the case if it was, in fact, abandoned,
or if he truly believed it to be abandoned and unwanted property.

It is said, and at first blush the claim has plausibility, that, if we
construe the statute to require a mental element as part of criminal
conversion, it becomes a meaningless duplication of the offense of
stealing, and that conversion can be given meaning only by interpreting
it to disregard intention. But here again a broader view of the
evolution of these crimes throws a different light on the legislation.

It is not surprising if there is considerable overlapping in the
embezzlement, stealing, purloining, and knowing conversion grouped in
this statute. What has concerned codifiers of the larceny-type offense
is that gaps or crevices have separated particular crimes of this
general class, and guilty men have escaped through the breaches. The
books contain a surfeit of cases drawing fine distinctions between
slightly different circumstances under which one may obtain wrongful
advantages from another\'s property. The codifiers wanted to reach all
such instances. Probably every stealing is a conversion, but certainly
not every knowing conversion is a stealing. **\[ ... \]**Conversion**\[
... \]**may be consummated without any intent to keep and without any
wrongful taking, where the initial possession by the converter was
entirely lawful. Conversion may include misuse or abuse of property. It
may reach use in an unauthorized manner or to an unauthorized extent of
property placed in one\'s custody for limited use. Money rightfully
taken into one\'s custody may be converted without any intent to keep or
embezzle it merely by commingling it with the custodian\'s own, if he
was under a duty to keep it separate and intact. It is not difficult to
think of intentional and knowing abuses and unauthorized uses of
government property that might be knowing conversions but which could
not be reached as embezzlement, stealing or purloining. **\[ ... \]**

We find no grounds for inferring any affirmative instruction from
Congress to eliminate intent from any offense with which this defendant
was charged.

**III**

As we read the record, this case was tried on the theory that, even if
criminal intent were essential, its presence (a) should be decided by
the court (b) as a presumption of law, apparently conclusive, (c)
predicated upon the isolated act of taking, rather than upon all of the
circumstances. In each of these respects we believe the trial court was
in error**\[ ... \]**

The court thought the only question was, \"Did he intend to take the
property?\" That the removal of them was a conscious and intentional act
was admitted. But that isolated fact is not an adequate basis on which
the jury should find the criminal intent to steal or knowingly convert,
that is, wrongfully to deprive another of possession of property.
Whether that intent existed, the jury must determine, nor only from the
act of taking, but from that together with defendant\'s testimony and
all of the surrounding circumstances.

Of course, the jury, considering Morissette\'s awareness that these
casings were on government property, his failure to seek any permission
for their removal, and his self-interest as a witness, might have
disbelieved his profession of innocent intent and concluded that his
assertion of a belief that the casings were abandoned was an
afterthought. Had the jury convicted on proper instructions it would be
the end of the matter. But juries are not bound by what seems
inescapable logic to judges. They might have concluded that the heaps of
spent casings left in the hinterland to rust away presented an
appearance of unwanted and abandoned junk, and that lack of any
conscious deprivation of property or intentional injury was indicated by
Morissette\'s good character, the openness of the taking, crushing and
transporting of the casings, and the candor with which it was all
admitted. They might have refused to brand Morissette as a thief. Had
they done so, that too would have been the end of the matter.

Notes and Questions

 

1\.    When interpreting statutes, the Supreme Court sometimes brings to
bear certain presumptions that reflect broader judicial concerns or
policy goals. Here, the Court notes that \"where Congress borrows terms
of art\...\[from common law\], it presumably knows and adopts the
\[general meanings surrounding those borrowed words\].\" And,
\"absent contrary direction,\" Congress adopts them without departing
from such \"widely accepted definitions.\" Is this a fair presumption?
What would a clear \"contrary direction\" look like? Was this case an
example of bad statutory drafting?

2\.    The Court also gestures at the aims of punishment in this case,
when it says that requiring a mens rea component to a crime enables
\"deterrence and reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as
the motivation for public prosecution.\" A crime without a mens rea
element, the Court continues in a footnote, would make the ends of
reformation and rehabilitation \"seem illusory.\" What do you make
of this rationale (that rehabilitation is the dominant objective of
public prosecution)? By the same token, do you think strict liability
crimes are mainly retributive? And would simply adding a mens rea
element curb the overall retributive impulse of punishing for a crime? 

3\.    The facts in *Morissette *revolve around a criminal conviction,
but the court gestures toward a common form of strict liability in the
civil context, \"public welfare offenses.\" As the court describes: 

> These cases do not fit neatly into any of such accepted
> classifications of common law offenses, such as those against the
> state, the person, property, or public morals\....Many \[public
> welfare\] violations\...result in no direct or immediate injury to
> person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it
> which the law seeks to minimize. While such offenses do not threaten
> the security of the state in the manner of treason, they may be
> regarded as offenses against its authority, for their occurrence
> impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social
> order as presently constituted.

*Morissette v. United States*, 342 U.S. 246, 255-56 (1952). 

The case also cites a seminal 1933 article by Harvard Law professor
Francis Sayre, listing some categories of public welfare offenses:

> \(1\) illegal sales of intoxicating liquor, (2) sales of impure or
> adulterated food or drugs, (3) sales of misbranded articles, (4)
> violations of antinarcotic Acts, (5) criminal nuisances, (6)
> violations of traffic regulations, (7) violations of motor-vehicle
> laws, and (8) violations of general police regulations, passed for the
> safety, health or well-being of the community.\"

Col.L.Rev. 55, 73, 84 (1933)). 

What are some good examples of crimes that could be classified as
\"public welfare offenses\"? Do you think these should be crimes that
call for a mental element, or not? 

 

 

 

Staples v. United States

 

United States Supreme Court

511 U.S. 600 (1994)

Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The National Firearms Act (Act), 26 U.S.C. §§ 5801--5872, imposes strict
registration requirements on statutorily defined "firearms." The Act
includes within the term "firearm" a machinegun, § 5845(a)(6), and
further defines a machinegun as "any weapon which shoots, \... or can be
readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without
manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger," § 5845(b). Thus,
any fully automatic weapon is a "firearm" within the meaning of the Act.
Under the Act, all firearms must be registered in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record maintained by the Secretary of the
Treasury. Section 5861(d) makes it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years
in prison for any person to possess a firearm that is not properly
registered.

Upon executing a search warrant at petitioner\'s home, local police and
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) recovered,
among other things, an AR--15 rifle. The AR--15 is the civilian version
of the military\'s M--16 rifle, and is, unless modified, a semiautomatic
weapon. The M--16, in contrast, is a selective fire rifle that allows
the operator, by rotating a selector switch, to choose semiautomatic or
automatic fire. Many M--16 parts are interchangeable with those in the
AR--15 and can be used to convert the AR--15 into an automatic weapon.
No doubt to inhibit such conversions, the AR--15 is manufactured with a
metal stop on its receiver that will prevent an M--16 selector switch,
if installed, from rotating to the fully automatic position. The metal
stop on petitioner\'s rifle, however, had been filed away, and the rifle
had been assembled with an M--16 selector switch and several other M--16
internal parts, including a hammer, disconnector, and trigger.
Suspecting that the AR--15 had been modified to be capable of fully
automatic fire, BATF agents seized the weapon. Petitioner subsequently
was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered machinegun in
violation of § 5861(d).

At trial, BATF agents testified that when the AR--15 was tested, it
fired more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger. It was
undisputed that the weapon was not registered as required by § 5861(d).
Petitioner testified that the rifle had never fired automatically when
it was in his possession. He insisted that the AR--15 had operated only
semiautomatically, and even then imperfectly, often requiring manual
ejection of the spent casing and chambering of the next round. According
to petitioner, his alleged ignorance of any automatic firing capability
should have shielded him from criminal liability for his failure to
register the weapon. He requested the District Court to instruct the
jury that, to establish a violation of § 5861(d), the Government must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant "knew that the gun
would fire fully automatically."

The District Court rejected petitioner\'s proposed instruction and
instead charged the jury as follows:

"The Government need not prove the defendant knows he\'s dealing with a
weapon possessing every last characteristic \[which subjects it\] to the
regulation. It would be enough to prove he knows that he is dealing with
a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the likelihood of
regulation."

Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to five years\' probation and a
\$5,000 fine*\[and the Court of Appeals affirmed\].*

Whether or not § 5861(d) requires proof that a defendant knew of the
characteristics of his weapon that made it a "firearm" under the Act is
a question of statutory construction. As we observed in *Liparota v.
United States*, 471 U.S. 419 (1985), "\[t\]he definition of the elements
of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in
the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute."
Thus, we have long recognized that determining the mental state required
for the commission of a federal crime requires "construction of the
statute and \... inference of the intent of Congress."

The language of the statute, the starting place in our inquiry, provides
little explicit guidance in this case. Section 5861(d) is silent
concerning the mens rea required for a violation. It states simply that
"\[i\]t shall be unlawful for any person \... to receive or possess a
firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d). Nevertheless,
silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggest that
Congress intended to dispense with a conventional mens rea element,
which would require that the defendant know the facts that make his
conduct illegal. On the contrary, we must construe the statute in light
of the background rules of the common law.

*\... \[W\]e* have stated that offenses that require no mens rea
generally are disfavored and have suggested that some indication of
congressional intent, express or implied, is required to dispense with
mens rea as an element of a crime.

According to the Government, however, the nature and purpose of the Act
suggest that the presumption favoring mens rea does not apply to this
case. The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate
and restrict the circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in the
Government\'s view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning
what we have termed "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses, in which
we have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal
liability through statutes that do not require the defendant to know the
facts that make his conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we
have inferred from silence that Congress did not intend to require proof
of mens rea to establish an offense.

For example, in *Balint*, we concluded that the Narcotic Act of 1914,
which was intended in part to minimize the spread of addictive drugs by
criminalizing undocumented sales of certain narcotics, required proof
only that the defendant knew that he was selling drugs, not that he knew
the specific items he had sold were "narcotics" within the ambit of the
statute. *Cf. United States v. Dotterweich*, 320 U.S. 277, 281 (1943)
(stating in dicta that a statute criminalizing the shipment of
adulterated or misbranded drugs did not require knowledge that the items
were misbranded or adulterated). As we explained in *Dotterweich*,
*Balint* dealt with "a now familiar type of legislation whereby
penalties serve as effective means of regulation. Such legislation
dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal
conduct---awareness of some wrongdoing." 320 U.S., at 280--281.

Such public welfare offenses have been created by Congress, and
recognized by this Court, in "limited circumstances." Typically, our
cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that regulate
potentially harmful or injurious items. In such situations, we have
reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a
dangerous device of a character that places him "in responsible relation
to a public danger," he should be alerted to the probability of strict
regulation, and we have assumed that in such cases Congress intended to
place the burden on the defendant to "ascertain at his peril whether
\[his conduct\] comes within the inhibition of the statute." *Balint*,
supra, 258 U.S., at 254. **\[ ... \]**

The Government argues that § 5861(d) defines precisely the sort of
regulatory offense described in *Balint*. In this view, all guns,
whether or not they are statutory "firearms," are dangerous devices that
put gun owners on notice that they must determine at their hazard
whether their weapons come within the scope of the Act. On this
understanding, the District Court\'s instruction in this case was
correct, because a conviction can rest simply on proof that a defendant
knew he possessed a "firearm" in the ordinary sense of the term.

The Government seeks support for its position from our decision in
*United States v. Freed*, 401 U.S. 601 (1971), which involved a
prosecution for possession of unregistered grenades under § 5861(d). The
defendant knew that the items in his possession were grenades, and we
concluded that § 5861(d) did not require the Government to prove the
defendant also knew that the grenades were unregistered. To be sure, in
deciding that mens rea was not required with respect to that element of
the offense, we suggested that the Act "is a regulatory measure in the
interest of the public safety, which may well be premised on the theory
that one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand
grenades is not an innocent act." Grenades, we explained, "are highly
dangerous offensive weapons, no less dangerous than the narcotics
involved in *United States v. Balint*." But that reasoning provides
little support for dispensing with mens rea in this case.

\[T\]he Government **\[ ... \]**ignores the particular care we have
taken to avoid construing a statute to dispense with mens rea where
doing so would "criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent
conduct." **\[ ... \]**

*\[T\]here*is a long tradition of widespread lawful gun ownership by
private individuals in this country. Such a tradition did not apply to
the possession of hand grenades in *Freed* or to the selling of
dangerous drugs that we considered in *Balint*. In fact, in *Freed* we
construed § 5861(d) under the assumption that "one would hardly be
surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent
act." Here, the Government essentially suggests that we should interpret
the section under the altogether different assumption that "one would
hardly be surprised to learn that owning a gun is not an innocent act."
That proposition is simply not supported by common experience. Guns in
general are not "deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste
materials," that put their owners on notice that they stand "in
responsible relation to a public danger."

The Government protests that guns, unlike food stamps, but like grenades
and narcotics, are potentially harmful devices. Under this view, it
seems that *Liparota\'s* concern for criminalizing ostensibly innocuous
conduct is inapplicable whenever an item is sufficiently
dangerous---that is, dangerousness alone should alert an individual to
probable regulation and justify treating a statute that regulates the
dangerous device as dispensing with mens rea. But that an item is
"dangerous," in some general sense, does not necessarily suggest, as the
Government seems to assume, that it is not also entirely innocent. Even
dangerous items can, in some cases, be so commonplace and generally
available that we would not consider them to alert individuals to the
likelihood of strict regulation. As suggested above, despite their
potential for harm, guns generally can be owned in perfect innocence. Of
course, we might surely classify certain categories of guns---no doubt
including the machineguns, sawed-off shotguns, and artillery pieces that
Congress has subjected to regulation---as items the ownership of which
would have the same quasi-suspect character we attributed to owning hand
grenades in *Freed*. But precisely because guns falling outside those
categories traditionally have been widely accepted as lawful
possessions, their destructive potential, while perhaps even greater
than that of some items we would classify along with narcotics and hand
grenades, cannot be said to put gun owners sufficiently on notice of the
likelihood of regulation to justify interpreting § 5861(d) as not
requiring proof of knowledge of a weapon\'s characteristics.

On a slightly different tack, the Government suggests that guns are
subject to an array of regulations at the federal, state, and local
levels that put gun owners on notice that they must determine the
characteristics of their weapons and comply with all legal requirements.
But regulation in itself is not sufficient to place gun ownership in the
category of the sale of narcotics in *Balint*. The food stamps at issue
in *Liparota* were subject to comprehensive regulations, yet we did not
understand the statute there to dispense with a mens rea requirement.
Moreover, despite the overlay of legal restrictions on gun ownership, we
question whether regulations on guns are sufficiently intrusive that
they impinge upon the common experience that owning a gun is usually
licit and blameless conduct. Roughly 50 percent of American homes
contain at least one firearm of some sort, and in the vast majority of
States, buying a shotgun or rifle is a simple transaction that would not
alert a person to regulation any more than would buying a car**\[ ...
\]**

Here, there can be little doubt that, as in *Liparota*, the
Government\'s construction of the statute potentially would impose
criminal sanctions on a class of persons whose mental state---ignorance
of the characteristics of weapons in their possession---makes their
actions entirely innocent. The Government does not dispute the
contention that virtually any semiautomatic weapon may be converted,
either by internal modification or, in some cases, simply by wear and
tear, into a machinegun within the meaning of the Act. Such a gun may
give no externally visible indication that it is fully automatic. But in
the Government\'s view, any person who has purchased what he believes to
be a semiautomatic rifle or handgun, or who simply has inherited a gun
from a relative and left it untouched in an attic or basement, can be
subject to imprisonment, despite absolute ignorance of the gun\'s firing
capabilities, if the gun turns out to be an automatic**\[ ... \]**

The potentially harsh penalty attached to the violation of §
5861(d)---up to 10 years\' imprisonment---confirms our reading of the
Act. Historically, the penalty imposed under a statute has been a
significant consideration in determining whether the statute should be
construed as dispensing with mens rea. Certainly, the cases that first
defined the concept of the public welfare offense almost uniformly
involved statutes that provided for only light penalties such as fines
or short jail sentences, not imprisonment in the state penitentiary.

Close adherence to the early cases described above might suggest that
punishing a violation as a felony is simply incompatible with the theory
of the public welfare offense. In this view, absent a clear statement
from Congress that mens rea is not required, we should not apply the
public welfare offense rationale to interpret any statute defining a
felony offense as dispensing with mens rea.

We need not adopt such a definitive rule of construction to decide this
case, however. Instead, we note only that where, as here, dispensing
with mens rea would require the defendant to have knowledge only of
traditionally lawful conduct, a severe penalty is a further factor
tending to suggest that Congress did not intend to eliminate a mens rea
requirement. In such a case, the usual presumption that a defendant must
know the facts that make his conduct illegal should apply.

In short, we conclude that the background rule of the common law
favoring mens rea should govern interpretation of § 5861(d) in this
case. Silence does not suggest that Congress dispensed with mens rea for
the element of § 5861(d) at issue here. Thus, to obtain a conviction,
the Government should have been required to prove that petitioner knew
of the features of his AR--15 that brought it within the scope of the
Act.

 

 

 

Practice Problem based on US v. X-Citement Video

 

Title 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (1988 ed. and Supp. V) provides, in relevant
part:

\(a\) Any person who---

\(1\) knowingly transports or ships in interstate or foreign commerce by
any means including by computer or mails, any visual depiction, if---

\(A\) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and

\(B\) such visual depiction is of such conduct;

\(2\) knowingly receives, or distributes, any visual depiction that has
been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign
commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so
shipped or transported, by any means including by computer, or knowingly
reproduces any visual depiction for distribution in interstate or
foreign commerce or through the mails, if---

\(A\) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and

\(B\) such visual depiction is of such conduct;

\....

shall be punished \[by up to 10 years in prison\].

Defendant owned and operated X-Citement Video, which was targeted by
undercover police posing as pornography retailers. During the sting
operation, news media exposed \'Traci Lords\' for her roles in
pornographic films while under the age of 18. An undercover agent sought
to buy Traci Lords tapes from the defendant. The defendant sold him 49
videotapes featuring Lords before her 18th birthday and, two months
later, shipped eight more such tapes of the agent's address in Hawaii.

Must the government prove that the defendant knew that the images he
sent through the mails were of minors engaging in sexual activity? Or is
it sufficient to show that she knew that she was shipping visual
depictions and that those depictions were in fact of minors engaged in
sexual activity? Under this statute, could a retailer seller of adult
porn videos be convicted if he did not know that the producers of one
video used underage performers? Could FedEx, or a FedEx delivery driver,
be convicted even though he did not know what was in the package he
delivered?

*See* *United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.*, 513 U.S. 64 (1994).

 

 

 

Practice Problem based on United States v. Jones

 

Defendant was charged under 18 U.S.C. §2423(a) with transporting an
underage girl across state lines "to act as a prostitute at a truck
stop." The statute provides:

A person who knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the
age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any
commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, with intent
that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity
for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, shall be
\[punished\]. 

What must the prosecution prove that the defendant knew? Clearly it must
prove that he \"knowingly transport\[ed\],\" and surely that he
knowingly transported \"an individual.\" But does the statute also
require that the defendant knew that the person he transported was under
age 18?

See United States v. Jones, 471 F.3d 535 (4th Cir. 2006).

 

 

 

5.2

Knowing or Willful Violations

 

The cases in the section deal not with legal elements (\"taking the
property of another,\" \"below the age of consent,\" etc.) but with
those rare situations where the law will excuse a defendant who knows
exactly what she is doing but is unaware that the law prohibits her
conduct. As with most questions of mens rea, courts treat this idea of
\"willful\" or \"knowing\" violation as a matter of legislative intent.

 

 

 

 

Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419 (1985)

 

Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The federal statute governing food stamp fraud provides that "whoever
knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or
authorization cards in any manner not authorized by \[the statute\] or
the regulations" is subject to a fine and imprisonment. 78 Stat. 708, as
amended, 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1). The question presented is whether in a
prosecution under this provision the Government must prove that the
defendant knew that he was acting in a manner not authorized by statute
or regulations.

Petitioner Frank Liparota was the co-owner with his brother of Moon's
Sandwich Shop in Chicago, Illinois. He was indicted for acquiring and
possessing food stamps in violation of § 2024(b)(1). The Department of
Agriculture had not authorized petitioner's restaurant to accept food
stamps. At trial, the Government proved that petitioner on three
occasions purchased food stamps from an undercover Department of
Agriculture agent for substantially less than their face value. On the
first occasion, the agent informed petitioner that she had \$195 worth
of food stamps to sell. The agent then accepted petitioner's offer of
\$150 and consummated the transaction in a back room of the restaurant
with petitioner's brother. A similar transaction occurred one week
later, in which the agent sold \$500 worth of coupons for \$350.
Approximately one month later, petitioner bought \$500 worth of food
stamps from the agent for \$300.

The controversy between the parties concerns the mental state, if any,
that the Government must show in proving that petitioner acted "in any
manner not authorized by \[the statute\] or the regulations." The
Government argues that petitioner violated the statute if he knew that
he acquired or possessed food stamps and if in fact that acquisition or
possession was in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations.
According to the Government, no *mens rea,* or "evil-meaning *mind,"*
... is necessary for conviction. Petitioner claims that the Government's
interpretation, by dispensing with *mens rea,* dispenses with the only
morally blameworthy element in the definition of the crime. To avoid
this allegedly untoward result, he claims that an individual violates
the statute if he knows that he has acquired or possessed food stamps
*and* if he also knows that he has done so in an unauthorized manner.
Our task is to determine which meaning Congress intended....

Absent indication of contrary purpose in the language or legislative
history of the statute, we believe that § 2024(b)(1) requires a showing
that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or
regulations. "The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only
when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is
as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in
freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the
normal individual to choose between good and evil." ... \[T\]he failure
of Congress explicitly and unambiguously to indicate whether *mens rea*
is required does not signal a departure from this background assumption
of our criminal law.

This construction is particularly appropriate where, as here, to
interpret the statute otherwise would be to criminalize a broad range of
apparently innocent conduct. For instance, § 2024(b)(1) declares it
criminal to use, transfer, acquire, alter, or possess food stamps in any
manner not authorized by statute or regulations. The statute provides
further that "\[c\]oupons issued to eligible households shall be used by
them only to purchase food in retail food stores which have been
approved for participation in the food stamp program *at prices
prevailing in such stores."* 7 U.S.C. § 2016(b) (emphasis added); *see
also* 7 CFR § 274.10(a) (1985). This seems to be the *only* authorized
use. A strict reading of the statute with no knowledge-of-illegality
requirement would thus render criminal a food stamp recipient who, for
example, used stamps to purchase food from a store that, unknown to him,
charged higher than normal prices to food stamp program participants.
Such a reading would also render criminal a nonrecipient of food stamps
who "possessed" stamps because he was mistakenly sent them through the
mail due to administrative error, "altered" them by tearing them up, and
"transferred" them by throwing them away. Of course, Congress *could*
have intended that this broad range of conduct be made illegal, perhaps
with the understanding that prosecutors would exercise their discretion
to avoid such harsh results. However, given the paucity of material
suggesting that Congress did so intend, we are reluctant to adopt such a
sweeping interpretation.

In addition, requiring *mens rea* is in keeping with our longstanding
recognition of the principle that "ambiguity concerning the ambit of
criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity." Application of
the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair
warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate
balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in
defining criminal liability. ....

... \[T\]he Government contends that the §2024(b)(1) offense is a
"public welfare" offense, which the Court defined in Morissette v.
United States, 342 U.S., at 252-253, to "depend on no mental element but
consist only of forbidden acts or omissions." Yet the offense at issue
here differs substantially from those "public welfare offenses" we have
previously recognized. In most previous instances, Congress has rendered
criminal a type of conduct that a reasonable person should know is
subject to stringent public regulation and may seriously threaten the
community's health or safety. Thus, in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S.
601 (1971), we examined the federal statute making it illegal to receive
or possess an unregistered firearm. In holding that the Government did
not have to prove that the recipient of unregistered hand grenades knew
that they were unregistered, we noted that "one would hardly be
surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent
act." Id., at 609. Similarly, in United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S.
277, 284 (1943), the Court held that a corporate officer could violate
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act when his firm shipped adulterated and
misbranded drugs, even "though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally
wanting." See also United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250 (1922). The
distinctions between these cases and the instant case are clear. A food
stamp can hardly be compared to a hand grenade, see Freed, nor can the
unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps be compared to the
selling of adulterated drugs, as in Dotterweich.

We hold that in a prosecution for violation of § 2024(b)(1), the
Government must prove that the defendant knew that his acquisition or
possession of food stamps was in a manner unauthorized by statute or
regulations. This holding does not put an unduly heavy burden on the
Government in prosecuting violators of § 2024(b)(1). To prove that
petitioner knew that his acquisition or possession of food stamps was
unauthorized, for example, the Government need not show that he had
knowledge of specific regulations governing food stamp acquisition or
possession. Nor must the Government introduce any extraordinary evidence
that would conclusively demonstrate petitioner's state of mind. Rather,
as in any other criminal prosecution requiring *mens rea,* the
Government may prove by reference to facts and circumstances surrounding
the case that petitioner knew that his conduct was unauthorized or
illegal. *Reversed.*

 

 

 

 

Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991)

 

Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Title 26 § 7201 of the United States Code provides that any person "who
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by
this title or the payment thereof" shall be guilty of a felony. Under 26
U. S. C. § 7203, "\[a\]ny person required under this title \... or by
regulations made under authority thereof to make a return . . . who
willfully fails to . . . make such return" shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. This case turns on the meaning of the word "willfully" as
used in §§ 7201 and 7203.

Petitioner John L. Cheek has been a pilot for American Airlines since
1973. He filed federal income tax returns through 1979 but thereafter
ceased to file returns. He also claimed an increasing number of
withholding allowances --- eventually claiming 60 allowances by mid-1980
--- and for the years 1981 to 1984 indicated on his W-4 forms that he
was exempt from federal income taxes. In 1983, petitioner unsuccessfully
sought a refund of all tax withheld by his employer in 1982.
Petitioner's income during this period at all times far exceeded the
minimum necessary to trigger the statutory filing requirement.

As a result of his activities, petitioner ... was charged with six
counts of willfully failing to file a federal income tax return for the
years 1980, 1981, and 1983 through 1986, in violation of 26 U.S.C. §
7203. He was further charged with three counts of willfully attempting
to evade his income taxes for the years 1980, 1981, and 1983 in
violation of § 7201.... The tax offenses with which petitioner was
charged are specific intent crimes that require the defendant to have
acted willfully.

In the course of its instructions, the trial court advised the jury that
to prove "willfulness" the Government must prove the voluntary and
intentional violation of a known legal duty, a burden that could not be
proved by showing mistake, ignorance, or negligence. The court further
advised the jury that an objectively reasonable good-faith
misunderstanding of the law would negate willfulness, but mere
disagreement with the law would not. The court ... instructed the jury
that if it found that Cheek "honestly and reasonably believed that he
was not required to pay income taxes or to file tax returns" a not
guilty verdict should be returned.

... \[In response to a question from the jury,\] the District Judge gave
the jury an additional instruction. This instruction stated in part that
"\[a\]n honest but unreasonable belief is not a defense and does not
negate willfulness" and that "\[a\]dvice or research resulting in the
conclusion that wages of a privately employed person are not income or
that the tax laws are unconstitutional is not objectively reasonable and
cannot serve as the basis for a good faith misunderstanding of the law
defense." The court also instructed the jury that "\[p\]ersistent
refusal to acknowledge the law does not constitute a good faith
misunderstanding of the law." Approximately two hours later, the jury
returned a verdict finding petitioner guilty on all counts.

The general rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no
defense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American legal
system. Based on the notion that the law is definite and knowable, the
common law presumed that every person knew the law. This common-law rule
has been applied by the Court in numerous cases construing criminal
statutes.

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it
difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of
the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. Congress has
accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making
specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal
criminal tax offenses. Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted
the statutory term "willfully" as used in the federal criminal tax
statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule. This
special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the
complexity of the tax laws. ...

In \[United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389 (1933)\], the Court
interpreted the term \"willfully\" as used in the criminal tax statutes
generally to mean \"an act done with a bad purpose,\"... or with \"an
evil motive.\" ... In United States v. Bishop, 412 U. S. 346 (1973), we
described the term \"willfully\" as connoting \"a voluntary, intentional
violation of a known legal duty\" ....

Willfulness, as construed by our prior decisions in criminal tax cases,
requires the Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the
defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily
and intentionally violated that duty. ... \[C\]arrying this burden
requires negating a defendant's claim of ignorance of the law or a claim
that because of a misunderstanding of the law, he had a good-faith
belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax
laws....

In this case, if Cheek asserted that he truly believed that the Internal
Revenue Code did not purport to treat wages as income, and the jury
believed him, the Government would not have carried its burden to prove
willfulness, however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief. Of
course, in deciding whether to credit Cheek's good-faith belief claim,
the jury would be free to consider any admissible evidence from any
source showing that Cheek was aware of his duty to file a return and to
treat wages as income, including evidence showing his awareness of the
relevant provisions of the Code or regulations, of court decisions
rejecting his interpretation of the tax law, of authoritative rulings of
the Internal Revenue Service, or of any contents of the personal income
tax return forms and accompanying instructions that made it plain that
wages should be returned as income.

It was therefore error to instruct the jury to disregard evidence of
Cheek's understanding that, within the meaning of the tax laws, he was
not a person required to file a return or to pay income taxes and that
wages are not taxable income, as incredible as such misunderstandings of
and beliefs about the law might be. Of course, the more unreasonable the
asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are, the more likely the jury will
consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known
legal duties imposed by the tax laws and will find that the Government
has carried its burden of proving knowledge....

Claims that some of the provisions of the tax code are unconstitutional
are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent
mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather,
they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied
conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and
unenforceable. Thus in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but
after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he
concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require
him to pay a tax.

We do not believe that Congress contemplated that such a taxpayer,
without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed
upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the
mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to
the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that
Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported
to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of
invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. Also, without
paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in
the Tax Court, with the right to appeal to a higher court if
unsuccessful. Cheek took neither course in some years, and when he did
was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position
to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal
Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal
prosecution under §§ 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this
very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated,
but like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts, who "willfully"
refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must
take the risk of being wrong.

.... It was therefore not error in this case for the District Judge to
instruct the jury not to consider Cheek's claims that the tax laws were
unconstitutional. However, it was error for the court to instruct the
jury that petitioner's asserted beliefs that wages are not income and
that he was not a taxpayer within the meaning of the Internal Revenue
Code should not be considered by the jury in determining whether Cheek
had acted willfully.... \[T\]he judgment of the Court of Appeals
\[affirming the conviction\] is vacated ....

Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.

It seems to me that we are concerned in this case not with "the
complexity of the tax laws," but with the income tax law in its most
elementary and basic aspect: Is a wage earner a taxpayer and are wages
income?

...\[I\]t is incomprehensible to me how, in this day, more than 70 years
after the institution of our present federal income tax system with the
passage of the Income Tax Act of 1913 any taxpayer of competent
mentality can assert as his defense to charges of statutory willfulness
the proposition that the wage he receives for his labor is not income,
irrespective of a cult that says otherwise and advises the gullible to
resist income tax collections. One might note in passing that this
particular taxpayer, after all, was a licensed pilot for one of our
major commercial airlines; he presumably was a person of at least
minimum intellectual competence.

The District Court's instruction that an objectively reasonable and
good-faith misunderstanding of the law negates willfulness lends
further, rather than less, protection to this defendant, for it adds an
additional hurdle for the prosecution to overcome. Petitioner should be
grateful for this further protection, rather than be opposed to it. ...

 

 

 

Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135 (1994)

 

Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

On the evening of October 20, 1988, defendant-petitioner Waldemar
Ratzlaf ran up a debt of \$160,000 playing blackjack at the High Sierra
Casino in Reno, Nevada. The casino gave him one week to pay. On the due
date, Ratzlaf returned to the casino with cash of \$100,000 in hand. A
casino official informed Ratzlaf that all transactions involving more
than \$10,000 in cash had to be reported to state and federal
authorities. The official added that the casino could accept a cashier's
check for the full amount due without triggering any reporting
requirement. The casino helpfully placed a limousine at Ratzlaf's
disposal, and assigned an employee to accompany him to banks in the
vicinity. Informed that banks, too, are required to report cash
transactions in excess of \$10,000, Ratzlaf purchased cashier's checks,
each for less than \$10,000 and each from a different bank. He delivered
these checks to the High Sierra Casino.

Based on this endeavor, Ratzlaf was charged with "structuring
transactions" to evade the banks' obligation to report cash transactions
exceeding \$10,000; this conduct, the indictment alleged, violated 31
U.S.C. §§ 5322(a) and 5324(3). The trial judge instructed the jury that
the Government had to prove defendant's knowledge of the banks'
reporting obligation and his attempt to evade that obligation, but did
not have to prove defendant knew the structuring was unlawful. Ratzlaf
was convicted, fined, and sentenced to prison.

Ratzlaf maintained on appeal that he could not be convicted of
"willfully violating" the antistructuring law solely on the basis of his
knowledge that a financial institution must report currency transactions
in excess of \$10,000 and his intention to avoid such reporting. To gain
a conviction for "willful" conduct, he asserted, the Government must
prove he was aware of the illegality of the "structuring" in which he
engaged. The Ninth Circuit ... affirmed Ratzlaf's conviction. We ... now
conclude that, to give effect to the statutory "willfulness"
specification, the Government had to prove Ratzlaf knew the structuring
he undertook was unlawful. We therefore reverse ....

... \[Federal law\] imposes a variety of reporting requirements on
individuals and institutions regarding foreign and domestic financial
transactions.... The reporting requirement relevant here, § 5313(a),
applies to domestic financial transactions. Section 5313(a) reads:

"When a domestic financial institution is involved in a transaction \[in
amounts over \$10,000, as defined by the Treasury Secretary in federal
regulations\] ... shall file a report on the transaction at the time and
in the way the Secretary prescribes\..."

To deter circumvention of this reporting requirement, ... an
antistructuring provision, 31 U.S.C. § 5324, ... which Ratzlaf is
charged with "willfully violating," reads:

"No person shall for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements
of section 5313(a) with respect to such transaction---

"(3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or
assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic
financial institutions."

The criminal enforcement provision at issue, 31 U.S.C. § 5322(a) ...
reads:

"A person willfully violating this subchapter \[31 U.S.C. §5311 *et*
*sec*.\] or a regulation prescribed under this subchapter ... shall be
fined not more than \$250,000, or \[imprisoned for\] not more than five
years, or both."

Section 5324 forbids structuring transactions with a "purpose of evading
the reporting requirements of section 5313(a)." Ratzlaf admits that he
structured cash transactions, and that he did so with knowledge of, and
a purpose to avoid, the banks' duty to report currency transactions in
excess of \$10,000. The statutory formulation (§ 5322) under which
Ratzlaf was prosecuted, however, calls for proof of "willful\[ness\]" on
the actor's part. The trial judge in Ratzlaf's case ... treated §
5322(a)'s "willfulness" requirement essentially as surplusage ....

"Willful," this Court has recognized, is a "word of many meanings," and
"its construction \[is\] often . . . influenced by its context." *Spies*
v. *United States,* 317 U. S. 492, 497 (1943). Accordingly, we view §§
5322(a) and 5324(3) mindful of the complex of provisions in which they
are embedded. In this light, we count it significant that § 5322(a)'s
omnibus "willfulness" requirement, when applied to other provisions in
the same subchapter, consistently has been read by the Courts of Appeals
to require both "knowledge of the reporting requirement" *and* a
"specific intent to commit the crime," *i.e.,* "a purpose to disobey the
law." \[Citations omitted.\]

The United States urges, however, that § 5324 violators, by their very
conduct, exhibit a purpose to do wrong, which suffices to show
"willfulness" .... "Structuring is not the kind of activity that an
ordinary person would engage in innocently." the United States asserts.
It is therefore "reasonable," the Government concludes, "to hold a
structurer responsible for evading the reporting requirements without
the need to prove specific knowledge that such evasion is unlawful."

Undoubtedly there are bad men who attempt to elude official reporting
requirements in order to hide from Government inspectors such criminal
activity as laundering drug money or tax evasion. But currency
structuring is not inevitably nefarious. ... Nor is a person who
structures a currency transaction invariably motivated by a desire to
keep the Government in the dark. But under the Government's construction
an individual would commit a felony against the United States by making
cash deposits in small doses, fearful that the bank's reports would
increase the likelihood of burglary, or in an endeavor to keep a former
spouse unaware of his wealth.

Courts have noted "many occasions" on which persons, without violating
any law, may structure transactions "in order to avoid the impact of
some regulation or tax." ... \[A\]s an *amicus* noted, countless
taxpayers each year give a gift of \$10,000 on December 31 and an
identical gift the next day, thereby legitimately avoiding the taxable
gifts reporting required by 26 U.S.C. § 2503(b).

... \[W\]e are unpersuaded by the argument that structuring is so
obviously "evil" or inherently "bad" that the "willfulness" requirement
is satisfied irrespective of the defendant's knowledge of the illegality
of structuring. Had Congress wished to dispense with the requirement, it
could have furnished the appropriate instruction....

We do not dishonor the venerable principle that ignorance of the law
generally is no defense to a criminal charge. See *Cheek* v. *United
States,* 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). In particular contexts, however,
Congress may decree otherwise. That, we hold, is what Congress has done
with respect to 31 U.S.C. § 5322(a) and the provisions it controls. To
convict Ratzlaf of the crime with which he was charged, violation of 31
U.S.C. §§ 5322(a) and 5324(3), the jury had to find he knew the
structuring in which he engaged was unlawful. Because the jury was not
properly instructed in this regard, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth
Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

Justice BLACKMUN, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'CONNOR, and
Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.

... Petitioner Ratzlaf, obviously not a person of limited intelligence,
was anything but uncomprehending as he traveled from bank to bank
converting his bag of cash to cashier's checks in \$9,500 bundles. I am
convinced that his actions constituted a "willful" violation of the
antistructuring provision embodied in 31 U.S.C. § 5324. As a result of
today's decision, Waldemar Ratzlaf --- to use an old phrase --- will be
"laughing all the way to the bank." ...

 

 

 

United States v. Bannon

 

101 F.4th 16 (D.C. Cir. 2024)

Garcia, Circuit Judge.\
In September 2021, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January
6th Attack on the United States Capitol issued a subpoena to appellant
Stephen Bannon to testify and provide documents. Bannon did not
comply---he knew what the subpoena required but did not appear or
provide a single document. Bannon was later convicted of violating the
contempt of Congress statute, 2 U.S.C. § 192, which criminalizes
"willfully" failing to respond to a congressional subpoena. Bannon
insists that "willfully" should be interpreted to require bad faith and
argues that his noncompliance does not qualify because his lawyer
advised him not to respond to the subpoena. This court, however, has
squarely held that "willfully" in Section 192 means only that the
defendant deliberately and intentionally refused to comply with a
congressional subpoena, and that this exact "advice of counsel" defense
is no defense at all. See Licavoli v. United States, 294 F.2d 207, 207
(D.C. Cir. 1961). As both this court and the Supreme Court have
repeatedly explained, a contrary rule would contravene the text of the
contempt statute and hamstring Congress's investigatory authority.
Because we have no basis to depart from that binding precedent, and
because none of Bannon's other challenges to his convictions have merit,
we affirm....\
Bannon did not comply with the subpoena in any respect. Nor, despite the
Committee's warnings, did he submit by October 18 any further
information bearing on the Committee's contempt deliberations. On
October 19, 2021, the Select Committee informed Bannon that it had
unanimously voted to recommend that the House of Representatives find
him in contempt of Congress.\
On November 12, 2021, a grand jury charged Bannon with two counts of
violating 2 U.S.C. § 192. Section 192 provides that "\[e\]very person
who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of . . . any
committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who,
having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the
question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty" of contempt of Congress.
2 U.S.C. § 192. The indictment's first count concerned Bannon's refusal
to appear for the deposition; the second concerned his refusal to
produce the sought-after documents and communications.\
On July 22, 2022, following a five-day trial, a jury found Bannon guilty
on both counts. The district court sentenced Bannon to four months'
incarceration for each count to run concurrently, with a \$6,500 fine.
The district court stayed Bannon's sentence pending this appeal.\
Bannon does not dispute that he deliberately refused to comply with the
Select Committee's subpoena in that he knew what the subpoena required
and intentionally did not respond; his nonresponse, in other words, was
no accident. Instead, Bannon challenges the contempt of Congress charges
on the ground that he reasonably believed---based on advice of
counsel---that he did not have to respond. He argued below and on appeal
that "willfully" making default in violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192 requires
bad faith---that the defendant must know that his conduct violated the
law. The district court, however, concluded that Section 192 requires
proof only that the defendant deliberately and intentionally did not
respond. The district court thus denied Bannon's motion to dismiss the
indictment based on his asserted good-faith reliance on his counsel's
advice, precluded Bannon from presenting such a defense at trial, and
instructed the jury consistent with those rulings. We review the
district court's legal determination de novo.\
In *Licavoli*, we concluded that "willfully" in Section 192 requires
that any failure to appear in response to a congressional subpoena be
only "deliberate" and "intentional." 294 F.2d at 208; see id. at 207-09.
It does not require bad faith, evil motive, or unlawful purpose. Id. at
209. Indeed, *Licavoli* specifically held that an advice of counsel
defense---which ultimately seeks to show the defendant acted in good
faith---is unavailable under this statute. Id. ("Advice of counsel does
not immunize that \[deliberate\] intention.").\
Recall that Section 192 criminalizes not only "willfully mak\[ing\]
default"---the clause at issue in *Licavoli* and this case---but
also---in a second clause---the conduct of one "who, having appeared,
refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry."
2 U.S.C. § 192. As *Licavoli* itself observed, the Supreme Court had
already held that the latter clause requires only a deliberate and
intentional refusal to answer. See 294 F.2d at 207-08. For example, in
Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263 (1929) ..., the Supreme Court
held that a conviction under that clause requires only an
"\[i\]ntentional violation"; no "moral turpitude" is required and
assertions that a defendant "acted in good faith on the advice of
competent counsel" are "no defense." Id. at 299.... Although the
"refusal to answer" clause does not use the term "willfully," *Licavoli*
rejected the argument that the presence of the adverb in one clause but
not the other counseled any different approach to the mental state
required when a subpoena recipient refuses to appear altogether instead
of appearing but refusing to answer pertinent questions. See 294 F.2d at
208....\
Moreover, cases addressing Section 192 have explained why, as a
practical matter, requiring evidence of bad faith would undermine the
statute's function. The ability to effectively enforce subpoenas is
critical to Congress's power of inquiry, which is in turn essential to
Congress's ability to legislate "wisely and effectively." Quinn v.
United States, 349 U.S. 155, 160-61 (1955). And effectively enforcing
congressional subpoenas would be exceedingly difficult if contempt
charges required showing that a failure to appear or refusal to answer
questions was not just deliberate and intentional, but also done in bad
faith. Otherwise, any subpoenaed witness could decline to respond and
claim they had a good-faith belief that they need not comply, regardless
of how idiosyncratic or misguided that belief may be. As the Supreme
Court has colorfully put it, a "subpoena has never been treated as an
invitation to a game of hare and hounds, in which the witness must
testify only if cornered at the end of the chase." United States Helen
Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, 331 (1950). "If that were the case, . . . the great
power of testimonial compulsion, so necessary to the effective
functioning of courts and legislatures, would be a nullity." Id.\
In the face of that authority, Bannon cites cases that ... interpret the
word "willfully" in other criminal statutes to require more than a
deliberate and intentional act. For example, in some criminal statutes,
"willful" conduct requires that the defendant act with a "bad purpose,"
meaning with "knowledge that his conduct was unlawful." Sillasse Bryan
v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. §
924(a)(1)(D), which criminalizes unlawfully dealing in firearms without
a license); Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 140-50 (1994)
(interpreting 31 U.S.C. §§ 5322, 5324, which prohibit willfully
structuring cash transactions for the purpose of evading reporting
requirements); United States v. Burden, 934 F.3d 675, 680, 689-93 (D.C.
Cir. 2019) (interpreting the "willful\[\]" violation of a provision
prohibiting the export of defense articles without a license). But that
is at most a "general" rule. *Sillasse Bryan*, 524 U.S. at 191. As those
same cases explain, "willful" "is a 'word of many meanings,'" and "'its
construction is often . . . influenced by its context.'" *Ratzlaf*, 510
U.S. at 141 (alteration omitted); see also *Sillasse Bryan*, 524 U.S. at
191 (noting that construction of word "willfully" in statutes "is often
dependent on the context in which it appears"). Because statutory
context is critical, nothing in the authorities Bannon relies upon calls
into question this court's longstanding interpretation of "willfully" in
Section 192 as requiring a deliberate, intentional failure to respond to
a subpoena....\
The judgment of conviction and sentence under 2 U.S.C. § 192 is
affirmed. So ordered.

\"Corruptly\" mens rea in federal prosecutions

 

 

 

 

§ 1512(c)(2): \"Corruptly\" obstructing official proceedings

 

Yet another mens rea term used in numerous federal statutes is
"corruptly." Examples include 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (obstruction of judicial
proceedings), § 1505 (obstruction of executive or congressional
proceedings), and § 1512 (obstruction of an official proceeding before a
federal agency, grand jury, or Congress). For example, 18 U.S.C. §
1512(c)(2) provides:

\(c\) Whoever corruptly---

\(1\) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or
other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the
object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; or

\(2\) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official
proceeding, or attempts to do so,

shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or
both.

Subsection 1512(k) criminalizes conspiracies to violate the statute's
substantive prohibitions in subsections 1512(a), (b), (c) & (d):

Whoever conspires to commit any offense under this section shall be
subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the
commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.

The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to define "corruptly" in
the context of § 1512(c), although it has addressed the meaning of
"corruptly" in other provisions, including § 1512(b), and related
obstruction statutes such as § 1503. In a recent decision approving
indictments charging three January 6 defendants with (among other
offenses) violations of § 1512(c)(2), the D.C. Circuit in United States
v. Fischer, 64 F.4th 329 (D.C. Cir. 2023), reversed on other grounds,
Fischer v. United States, 144 S. Ct. 2176 (2024), described case law
interpreting "corruptly" in § 1512 and other obstruction statutes,
although *Fischer* did not require the court definitively to define the
term:

... \[A\] narrow construction of \"corruptly\" would indeed limit the
*actus reus* of a § 1512(c)(2) violation. The requirement of \"corrupt\"
intent prevents subsection (c)(2) from sweeping up a great deal of
conduct that has nothing to do with obstruction --- for instance,
lobbyists who know they advocate for morally wrongful causes. Notably,
the other crimes enumerated in** **§ 1512 --- such as killing,
threatening, or dissuading witnesses --- are classic examples of
obstruction of justice.... Subsection (c)(2) best fits with those crimes
if \"corruptly\" constrains its scope.

As relevant to the instant case, the allegations against appellees
appear to be sufficient to meet any proposed definition of \"corrupt\"
intent. Without expressing a preference for any particular definition of
\"corruptly,\" I consider three candidates. First, in considering the
meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b) in *Arthur Andersen LLP v. United
States*, the Supreme Court noted that the \"natural meaning\" of
\"corruptly\" is \"clear\" and that the word is \"normally associated
with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil\" conduct. 544 U.S. 696, 705
(2005). Second, the government here asserts that the element of a
\"corrupt\" state of mind is satisfied when a defendant acts \"with a
corrupt purpose,\" through \"independently corrupt means,\" or both.
Gov\'t\'s Reply 24 (quoting** ***Sandlin*, 575 F. Supp. 3d at 31); *see
also United States v. North*, 910 F.2d 843, 942-43 (D.C. Cir. 1990)
(Silberman, J., concurring and dissenting in part). A third definition
of the term \"corruptly\" was endorsed by Justice Scalia in his partial
concurrence in *United States v. Aguilar*, which examined the phrase
\"corruptly . . . endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede the due
administration of justice\" under § 1503. 515 U.S. at 616-17 (Scalia,
J., concurring and dissenting in part). Justice Scalia quoted with
approval a jury instruction specifying that \"\[a\]n act is done
corruptly if it\'s done voluntarily and intentionally to bring about
either an unlawful result or a lawful result by some unlawful method,
with a hope or expectation of either financial gain or other benefit to
oneself or a benefit of another person.\" *Id.*

Under all those formulations, \"corrupt\" intent exists at least when an
obstructive action is independently unlawful --- *i.e.*, an
independently unlawful act is necessarily \"wrongful\" and encompasses a
perpetrator\'s use of \"independently corrupt means\" or \"an unlawful
method.\" *Id*. Each appellee ... is charged with assaulting law
enforcement officers while participating in the Capitol riot, and
such** **behavior clearly meets the test of independently unlawful
conduct. Furthermore, the additional element identified by Justice
Scalia also appears to be met: Appellees\' alleged intentions of helping
their preferred candidate overturn the election results would suffice to
establish a \"hope or expectation of either . . . benefit to oneself or
a benefit of another person.\" *Aguilar*, 515 U.S. at 616-17. Thus, the
sufficiency of the indictments in this case does not turn on the precise
definition of \"corruptly.\" Because the task of defining \"corruptly\"
is not before us and I am satisfied that the government has alleged
conduct by appellees sufficient to meet that element, I leave the exact
contours of \"corrupt\" intent for another day.

The concurring opinion embraces the definition of \"corruptly\" that
requires proof that the defendant acted \"with an intent to procure an
unlawful benefit either for himself or for some other person.\" ... \[In
*Aguilar*, which addressed\] obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. §
1503, ... the Supreme Court has declined to approve the very definition
of \"corruptly\" espoused by the concurrence. *See Aguilar*, 515 U.S. at
599-602 \[Rehnquist, C.J.\]....

What are differences between the three definitions of "corruptly" that
*Fischer* describes? Can you describe how "corruptly" requires proof of
something than if the statute used the term "intentionally"? What kind
of facts would prove that one acted \"with a corrupt purpose\" as
opposed to through \"independently corrupt means\"? Alternately, what
facts would show that a defendant's actions were "done voluntarily and
intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or a lawful
result by some unlawful method, with a hope or expectation of either
financial gain or other benefit to oneself or a benefit of another
person"?

 

 

 

Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. 723 (2015)

 

Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

Federal law makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any
communication containing any threat \... to injure the person of
another." 18 U.S.C. §875(c). Petitioner was convicted of violating this
provision under instructions that required the jury to find that he
communicated what a reasonable person would regard as a threat. The
question is whether the statute also requires that the defendant be
aware of the threatening nature of the communication, and---if
not---whether the First Amendment requires such a showing.

A

Anthony Douglas Elonis was an active user of ... Facebook. Users of that
Web site may post items on their Facebook page that are accessible to
other users, including Facebook "friends" who are notified when new
content is posted. In May 2010, Elonis's wife of nearly seven years left
him, taking with her their two young children. Elonis began "listening
to more violent music" and posting self-styled "rap" lyrics inspired by
the music. Eventually, Elonis changed the user name on his Facebook page
from his actual name to a rap-style nom de plume, "Tone Dougie," to
distinguish himself from his "on-line persona." The lyrics Elonis posted
as "Tone Dougie" included graphically violent language and imagery. This
material was often interspersed with disclaimers that the lyrics were
"fictitious," with no intentional "resemblance to real persons." Elonis
posted an explanation to another Facebook user that "I'm doing this for
me. My writing is therapeutic."

Elonis's co-workers and friends viewed the posts in a different light.
Around Halloween of 2010, Elonis posted a photograph of himself and a
co-worker at a "Halloween Haunt" event at the amusement park where they
worked. In the photograph, Elonis was holding a toy knife against his
co-worker's neck, and in the caption Elonis wrote, "I wish." Elonis was
not Facebook friends with the co-worker and did not "tag" her, a
Facebook feature that would have alerted her to the posting. But the
chief of park security was a Facebook "friend" of Elonis, saw the
photograph, and fired him.

In response, Elonis posted a new entry on his Facebook page:

"Moles! Didn't I tell y'all I had several? Y'all sayin' I had access to
keys for all the f\*\*\*in' gates. That I have sinister plans for all my
friends and must have taken home a couple. Y'all think it's too dark and
foggy to secure your facility from a man as mad as me? You see, even
without a paycheck, I'm still the main attraction. Whoever thought the
Halloween Haunt could be so f\*\*\*in' scary?"

This post became the basis for Count One of Elonis's subsequent
indictment, threatening park patrons and employees.

Elonis's posts frequently included crude, degrading, and violent
material about his soon-to-be ex-wife. Shortly after he was fired,
Elonis posted an adaptation of a satirical sketch that he and his wife
had watched together. In the actual sketch, called "It's Illegal to Say
\...," a comedian explains that it is illegal for a person to say he
wishes to kill the President, but not illegal to explain that it is
illegal for him to say that. When Elonis posted the script of the
sketch, however, he substituted his wife for the President. The posting
was part of the basis for Count Two of the indictment, threatening his
wife:

"Hi, I'm Tone Elonis.

Did you know that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife?
\...

It's one of the only sentences that I'm not allowed to say\.... 

Now it was okay for me to say it right then because I was just telling
you that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife\.... 

Um, but what's interesting is that it's very illegal to say I really,
really think someone out there should kill my wife\.... 

But not illegal to say with a mortar launcher.

Because that's its own sentence\.... 

I also found out that it's incredibly illegal, extremely illegal to go
on Facebook and say something like the best place to fire a mortar
launcher at her house would be from the cornfield behind it because of
easy access to a getaway road and you'd have a clear line of sight
through the sun room\.... 

Yet even more illegal to show an illustrated diagram.

\[diagram of the house\]\...."

The details about the home were accurate. At the bottom of the post,
Elonis included a link to the video of the original skit, and wrote,
"Art is about pushing limits. I'm willing to go to jail for my
Constitutional rights. Are you?"

After viewing some of Elonis's posts, his wife felt "extremely afraid
for \[her\] life." A state court granted her a three-year
protection-from-abuse order against Elonis (essentially, a restraining
order). Elonis referred to the order in another post on his "Tone
Dougie" page, also included in Count Two of the indictment:

"Fold up your \[protection-from-abuse order\] and put it in your pocket

Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?

Try to enforce an Order

that was improperly granted in the first place

Me thinks the Judge needs an education

on true threat jurisprudence

And prison time'll add zeros to my settlement \...

And if worse comes to worse

I've got enough explosives

to take care of the State Police and the Sheriff's Department."

At the bottom of this post was a link to the Wikipedia article on
"Freedom of speech." Elonis's reference to the police was the basis for
Count Three of his indictment, threatening law enforcement officers.

That same month, interspersed with posts about a movie Elonis liked and
observations on a comedian's social commentary, Elonis posted an entry
that gave rise to Count Four of his indictment:

"That's it, I've had about enough

I'm checking out and making a name for myself

Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius

to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined

And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a Kindergarten class

The only question is \... which one?"

Meanwhile, park security had informed both local police and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation about Elonis's posts, and FBI Agent Denise
Stevens had created a Facebook account to monitor his online activity.
After the post about a school shooting, Agent Stevens and her partner
visited Elonis at his house. Following their visit, during which Elonis
was polite but uncooperative, Elonis posted another entry on his
Facebook page, called "Little Agent Lady," which led to Count Five:

"You know your s\*\*\*'s ridiculous

when you have the FBI knockin' at yo' door

Little Agent lady stood so close

Took all the strength I had not to turn the b\*\*\*\* ghost

Pull my knife, flick my wrist, and slit her throat

Leave her bleedin' from her jugular in the arms of her partner

\[laughter\]

So the next time you knock, you best be serving a warrant

And bring yo' SWAT and an explosives expert while you're at it

Cause little did y'all know, I was strapped wit' a bomb

Why do you think it took me so long to get dressed with no shoes on?

I was jus' waitin' for y'all to handcuff me and pat me down

Touch the detonator in my pocket and we're all goin'

\[BOOM!\]

Are all the pieces comin' together?

S\*\*\*, I'm just a crazy sociopath

that gets off playin' you stupid f\*\*\*s like a fiddle

And if y'all didn't hear, I'm gonna be famous

Cause I'm just an aspiring rapper who likes the attention

who happens to be under investigation for terrorism

cause y'all think I'm ready to turn the Valley into Fallujah

But I ain't gonna tell you which bridge is gonna fall

into which river or road

And if you really believe this s\*\*\*

I'll have some bridge rubble to sell you tomorrow

\[BOOM!\] \[BOOM!\] \[BOOM!\]"

A grand jury indicted Elonis for making threats to injure patrons and
employees of the park, his estranged wife, police officers, a
kindergarten class, and an FBI agent, all in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§875(c). In the District Court, Elonis moved to dismiss the indictment
for failing to allege that he had intended to threaten anyone. The
District Court denied the motion, holding that Third Circuit precedent
required only that Elonis "intentionally made the communication, not
that he intended to make a threat." At trial, Elonis testified that his
posts emulated the rap lyrics of the well-known performer Eminem, some
of which involve fantasies about killing his ex-wife. In Elonis's view,
he had posted "nothing \... that hasn't been said already." The
Government presented as witnesses Elonis's wife and co-workers, all of
whom said they felt afraid and viewed Elonis's posts as serious threats.

Elonis requested a jury instruction that "the government must prove that
he intended to communicate a true threat." The District Court denied
that request. The jury instructions instead informed the jury that

"A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a
statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a reasonable
person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to
whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an
intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual."

The Government's closing argument emphasized that it was irrelevant
whether Elonis intended the postings to be threats---"it doesn't matter
what he thinks." A jury convicted Elonis on four of the five counts
against him, acquitting only on the charge of threatening park patrons
and employees. Elonis was sentenced to three years, eight months'
imprisonment and three years' supervised release.

Elonis renewed his challenge to the jury instructions in the Court of
Appeals, contending that the jury should have been required to find that
he intended his posts to be threats. The Court of Appeals disagreed,
holding that the intent required by Section 875(c) is only the intent to
communicate words that the defendant understands, and that a reasonable
person would view as a threat\....

II

A

An individual who "transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any
communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat
to injure the person of another" is guilty of a felony and faces up to
five years' imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. §875(c). This statute requires that
a communication be transmitted and that the communication contain a
threat. It does not specify that the defendant must have any mental
state with respect to these elements. In particular, it does not
indicate whether the defendant must intend that his communication
contain a threat.

Elonis argues that the word "threat" itself in Section 875(c) imposes
such a requirement. According to Elonis, every definition of "threat" or
"threaten" conveys the notion of an intent to inflict harm. E.g., 11
Oxford English Dictionary 353 (1933) ("to declare (usually
conditionally) one's intention of inflicting injury upon"); Webster's
New International Dictionary 2633 (2d ed. 1954) ("Law, specif., an
expression of an intention to inflict loss or harm on another by illegal
means"); Black's Law Dictionary 1519 (8th ed. 2004) ("A communicated
intent to inflict harm or loss on another").

These definitions, however, speak to what the statement conveys---not to
the mental state of the author. For example, an anonymous letter that
says "I'm going to kill you" is "an expression of an intention to
inflict loss or harm" regardless of the author's intent. A victim who
receives that letter in the mail has received a threat, even if the
author believes (wrongly) that his message will be taken as a joke.

For its part, the Government argues that Section 875(c) should be read
in light of its neighboring provisions, Sections 875(b) and 875(d).
Those provisions also prohibit certain types of threats, but expressly
include a mental state requirement of an "intent to extort." See 18
U.S.C. §875(b) (proscribing threats to injure or kidnap made "with
intent to extort"); §875(d) (proscribing threats to property or
reputation made "with intent to extort"). According to the Government,
the express "intent to extort" requirements in Sections 875(b) and (d)
should preclude courts from implying an unexpressed "intent to threaten"
requirement in Section 875(c)\.... 

The Government takes this *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* canon
too far. The fact that Congress excluded the requirement of an "intent
to extort" from Section 875(c) is strong evidence that Congress did not
mean to confine Section 875(c) to crimes of extortion. But that does not
suggest that Congress, at the same time, also meant to exclude a
requirement that a defendant act with a certain mental state in
communicating a threat. The most we can conclude from the language of
Section 875(c) and its neighboring provisions is that Congress meant to
proscribe a broad class of threats in Section 875(c), but did not
identify what mental state, if any, a defendant must have to be
convicted.

In sum, neither Elonis nor the Government has identified any indication
of a particular mental state requirement in the text of Section 875(c).

B

The fact that the statute does not specify any required mental state,
however, does not mean that none exists. We have repeatedly held that
"mere omission from a criminal enactment of any mention of criminal
intent" should not be read "as dispensing with it." Morissette v. United
States, 342 U.S. 246, 250 (1952)\.... Although there are exceptions, the
"general rule" is that a guilty mind is "a necessary element in the
indictment and proof of every crime." United States v. Balint, 258 U.S.
250, 251 (1922). We therefore generally "interpret\[ \] criminal
statutes to include broadly applicable scienter requirements, even where
the statute by its terms does not contain them." United States v.
X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 70 (1994).

This is not to say that a defendant must know that his conduct is
illegal before he may be found guilty. The familiar maxim "ignorance of
the law is no excuse" typically holds true. Instead, our cases have
explained that a defendant generally must "know the facts that make his
conduct fit the definition of the offense," Staples v. United States,
511 U.S. 600, n.3 (1994), even if he does not know that those facts give
rise to a crime\.... 

When interpreting federal criminal statutes that are silent on the
required mental state, we read into the statute "only that mens rea
which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from 'otherwise innocent
conduct.' " Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 269 (2000). In some
cases, a general requirement that a defendant act knowingly is itself an
adequate safeguard\.... In other instances, however, requiring only that
the defendant act knowingly "would fail to protect the innocent actor."
\... 

C

Section 875(c), as noted, requires proof that a communication was
transmitted and that it contained a threat. The "presumption in favor of
a scienter requirement should apply to *each* of the statutory elements
that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct." *X-Citement Video*, 513
U.S., at 72 (emphasis added). The parties agree that a defendant under
Section 875(c) must know that he is transmitting a communication. But
communicating *something* is not what makes the conduct "wrongful." Here
"the crucial element separating legal innocence from wrongful conduct"
is the threatening nature of the communication. The mental state
requirement must therefore apply to the fact that the communication
contains a threat.

Elonis's conviction, however, was premised solely on how his posts would
be understood by a reasonable person. Such a "reasonable person"
standard is a familiar feature of civil liability in tort law, but is
inconsistent with "the conventional requirement for criminal
conduct---*awareness* of some wrongdoing." *Staples*, 511 U.S., at
606-607 (quoting United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 281 (1943);
emphasis added). Having liability turn on whether a "reasonable person"
regards the communication as a threat---regardless of what the defendant
thinks---reduces culpability on the all-important element of the crime
to negligence, and we "have long been reluctant to infer that a
negligence standard was intended in criminal statutes," Rogers v. United
States, 422 U.S. 35, 47 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring) (citing
*Morissette*, 342 U.S. 246)\.... Under these principles, "what
\[Elonis\] thinks" does matter\.... 

\* \* \*

In light of the foregoing, Elonis's conviction cannot stand. The jury
was instructed that the Government need prove only that a reasonable
person would regard Elonis's communications as threats, and that was
error. Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the
results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state. That
understanding "took deep and early root in American soil" and Congress
left it intact here: Under Section 875(c), "wrongdoing must be conscious
to be criminal." *Morissette*, 342 U.S., at 252.

There is no dispute that the mental state requirement in Section 875(c)
is satisfied if the defendant transmits a communication for the purpose
of issuing a threat, or with knowledge that the communication will be
viewed as a threat. In response to a question at oral argument, Elonis
stated that a finding of recklessness would not be sufficient. Neither
Elonis nor the Government has briefed or argued that point, and we
accordingly decline to address it\.... Given our disposition, it is not
necessary to consider any First Amendment issues\.... 

Justice Alito \... suggests that we have not clarified confusion in the
lower courts. That is wrong. Our holding makes clear that negligence is
not sufficient to support a conviction under Section 875(c), contrary to
the view of nine Courts of Appeals. There was and is no circuit conflict
over the question Justice Alito and Justice Thomas would have us
decide---whether recklessness suffices for liability under Section
875(c). No Court of Appeals has even addressed that question. We think
that is more than sufficient "justification," post, at 2 (opinion of
Alito, J.), for us to decline to be the first appellate tribunal to do
so\.... 

We may be "capable of deciding the recklessness issue," post, at 2
(opinion of Alito, J.), but following our usual practice of awaiting a
decision below and hearing from the parties would help ensure that we
decide it correctly.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
is reversed\.... 

Justice Alito, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), the Court famously
proclaimed: "It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is." Today, the Court announces: It is
emphatically the prerogative of this Court to say only what the law is
not.

The Court's disposition of this case is certain to cause confusion and
serious problems. Attorneys and judges need to know which mental state
is required for conviction under 18 U.S.C. §875(c), an important
criminal statute. This case squarely presents that issue, but the Court
provides only a partial answer. The Court holds that the jury
instructions in this case were defective because they required only
negligence in conveying a threat. But the Court refuses to explain what
type of intent was necessary. Did the jury need to find that Elonis had
the purpose of conveying a true threat? Was it enough if he knew that
his words conveyed such a threat? Would recklessness suffice? The Court
declines to say. Attorneys and judges are left to guess.

This will have regrettable consequences. While this Court has the luxury
of choosing its docket, lower courts and juries are not so fortunate.
They must actually decide cases, and this means applying a standard. If
purpose or knowledge is needed and a district court instructs the jury
that recklessness suffices, a defendant may be wrongly convicted. On the
other hand, if recklessness is enough, and the jury is told that
conviction requires proof of more, a guilty defendant may go free. We
granted review in this case to resolve a disagreement among the
Circuits. But the Court has compounded---not clarified---the
confusion\.... 

 \... In the hierarchy of mental states that may be required as a
condition for criminal liability, the mens rea just above negligence is
recklessness. Negligence requires only that the defendant "should
\[have\] be\[en\] aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk," ALI,
Model Penal Code §2.02(2)(d), while recklessness exists "when a person
disregards a risk of harm of which he is aware," Model Penal Code
§2.02(2)(c). And when Congress does not specify a mens rea in a criminal
statute, we have no justification for inferring that anything more than
recklessness is needed. It is quite unusual for us to interpret a
statute to contain a requirement that is nowhere set out in the text.
Once we have reached recklessness, we have gone as far as we can without
stepping over the line that separates interpretation from amendment.

There can be no real dispute that recklessness regarding a risk of
serious harm is wrongful conduct\.... Someone who acts recklessly with
respect to conveying a threat necessarily grasps that he is not engaged
in innocent conduct. He is not merely careless. He is aware that others
could regard his statements as a threat, but he delivers them anyway.

Accordingly, I would hold that a defendant may be convicted under
§875(c) if he or she consciously disregards the risk that the
communication transmitted will be interpreted as a true threat\.... 

\[B\]ecause the jury instructions in this case did not require proof of
recklessness, I would vacate the judgment below and remand for the Court
of Appeals to decide in the first instance whether Elonis's conviction
could be upheld under a recklessness standard\.... 

Justice Thomas, dissenting.

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the lower courts over the
appropriate mental state for threat prosecutions under 18 U.S.C.
§875(c). Save two, every Circuit to have considered the issue---11 in
total---has held that this provision demands proof only of general
intent, which here requires no more than that a defendant knew he
transmitted a communication, knew the words used in that communication,
and understood the ordinary meaning of those words in the relevant
context. The outliers are the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which have
concluded that proof of an intent to threaten was necessary for
conviction\.... 

Rather than resolve the conflict, the Court casts aside the approach
used in nine Circuits and leaves nothing in its place. Lower courts are
thus left to guess at the appropriate mental state for §875(c). All they
know after today's decision is that a requirement of general intent will
not do. But they can safely infer that a majority of this Court would
not adopt an intent-to-threaten requirement, as the opinion carefully
leaves open the possibility that recklessness may be enough.

This failure to decide throws everyone from appellate judges to everyday
Facebook users into a state of uncertainty. This uncertainty could have
been avoided had we simply adhered to the background rule of the common
law favoring general intent. Although I am sympathetic to my colleagues'
policy concerns about the risks associated with threat prosecutions, the
answer to such fears is not to discard our traditional approach to
state-of-mind requirements in criminal law. Because the Court of Appeals
properly applied the general-intent standard, and because the
communications transmitted by Elonis were "true threats" unprotected by
the First Amendment, I would affirm the judgment below\.... 

General intent divides those who know the facts constituting the *actus
reus* of this crime from those who do not. For example, someone who
transmits a threat who does not know English---or who knows English, but
perhaps does not know a threatening idiom---lacks the general intent
required under §875(c). Likewise, the hapless mailman who delivers a
threatening letter, ignorant of its contents, should not fear
prosecution. A defendant like Elonis, however, who admits that he "knew
that what \[he\] was saying was violent" but supposedly "just wanted to
express \[him\]self," acted with the general intent required under
§875(c), even if he did not know that a jury would conclude that his
communication constituted a "threat" as a matter of law\.... 

Requiring general intent in this context is not the same as requiring
mere negligence. Like the mental-state requirements adopted in many of
the cases cited by the Court, general intent under §875(c) prevents a
defendant from being convicted on the basis of any fact beyond his
awareness. See, e.g., United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S.
64, 73 (1994) (knowledge of age of persons depicted in explicit
materials); *Staples*, supra, at 614-615 (knowledge of firing capability
of weapon); Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246-271 (1952)
(knowledge that property belonged to another). In other words, the
defendant must know---not merely be reckless or negligent with respect
to the fact---that he is committing the acts that constitute the *actus
reus* of the offense.

But general intent requires no mental state (not even a negligent one)
concerning the "fact" that certain words meet the legal definition of a
threat. That approach is particularly appropriate where, as here, that
legal status is determined by a jury's application of the legal standard
of a "threat" to the contents of a communication. And convicting a
defendant despite his ignorance of the legal---or objective---status of
his conduct does not mean that he is being punished for negligent
conduct\.... 

 \... Not only does \[today's\] decision warp our traditional approach
to mens rea, it results in an arbitrary distinction between threats and
other forms of unprotected speech. Had Elonis mailed obscene materials
to his wife and a kindergarten class, he could have been prosecuted
irrespective of whether he intended to offend those recipients or
recklessly disregarded that possibility. Yet when he threatened to kill
his wife and a kindergarten class, his intent to terrify those
recipients (or reckless disregard of that risk) suddenly becomes highly
relevant. That need not---and should not---be the case.

Nor should it be the case that we cast aside the mental-state
requirement compelled by our precedents yet offer nothing in its place.
Our job is to decide questions, not create them. Given the majority's
ostensible concern for protecting innocent actors, one would have
expected it to announce a clear rule---any clear rule. Its failure to do
so reveals the fractured foundation upon which today's decision rests.

I respectfully dissent.

Property Crimes

 

With this chapter, we shift from the \"general part\" of criminal
law\--meaning general rules and principles that are relevant to all
sorts of criminal offenses\--to what traditionally has been called
\"special part\" of criminal law, meaning the definition specific
criminal offenses. In this chapter and most of those following, we
examine issues that arise in the interpretation and application of
criminal statutes that address particular types or categories of
wrongdoing. Subsequent chapters take up offenses specific to illicit
drugs, conspiracies, sexual assault, and homicide. In this chapter, the
subject is crimes targeting property. All fall under the broad category
of theft, although in some of these offenses such as robbery and
extortion, threats to persons are integral to the wrongdoing and the
definition of the offense.

Property crimes, although likely familiar, sometimes present challenging
questions and rely on subtle definitions and distinctions. In simple
theft offenses\--when the owner/victim is not present\--tricky issues
occasionally arise about the ownership status of the property. In
offenses defining thefts from persons, other challenging distinctions
arise. For example, in federal law, robbery is the wrongful taking of
property from another \"against his will, by means of actual or
threatened force,\" while extortion is the wrongful faking of property
from another \"with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or
threatened force.\" See [18 U.S.C. §
1951](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1951)(b). In the crime
of blackmail, the challenge is defining precisely when a threat to do
something that is in other contexts perfectly lawful crosses the line
from permissible negotiating or pressure tactics to criminal extortion.

State v. Keeton

 

Supreme Court of Iowa

710 N.W.2d 531 (2006)

Opinion of Cady, J.

In this appeal, the defendant claims there was insufficient evidence to
support the assault element of his conviction for second-degree robbery
of a convenience store, during which the store clerk confronted him at
the door of the store as he was attempting to exit following a theft. In
resolving the issue, the State asks that we declare the crime of assault
to be a general-intent offense and submits a well-researched and
thorough brief to support its position. We conclude substantial evidence
supports the conviction and decline to consider the additional question
raised by the State. We affirm the judgment and sentence of the district
court.

On March 28, 2004, Larry Keeton entered a convenience store in
Marshalltown and purchased a pack of cigarettes. When the store clerk
opened the cash register drawer to make change, Keeton reached over the
counter and grabbed the twenty-dollar bills from the register. He
stated: "I'll take that." Keeton then attempted to exit the store, but
the clerk rushed to the door and blocked his path by standing in front
of the double doors. She also tried to grab the cash from Keeton's hand
as he approached, but he would not release the money from his hand.
Their hands touched when she attempted to retrieve the money. Keeton
then briefly backed away from the door and extended his arm. The clerk
realized she could not keep him in the store until police arrived, and
stepped aside to allow Keeton to leave the store. As he exited through
the door, she snatched the hat from his head in anger. The incident was
recorded by surveillance video.

Keeton was arrested and charged with robbery in the second degree in
violation of Iowa Code section 711.1(1) (2003). He waived his right to a
jury trial, and the case proceeded to a bench trial. The district court
found Keeton guilty of second-degree robbery and sentenced him to a term
of imprisonment not to exceed ten years.

Keeton appeals. He claims there was insufficient evidence presented at
trial to support the assault element of robbery\... . 

Section 711.1 defines robbery as follows:

"A person commits a robbery when, having the intent to commit a theft,
the person does any of the following acts to assist or further the
commission of the intended theft or the person's escape from the scene
thereof with or without the stolen property: 1. Commits an assault upon
another\...."

The State \... claimed at trial that Keeton committed an assault on the
store clerk in furtherance of his escape from the convenience store.

We look to the definition of assault in section 708.1 to consider
whether a robbery occurred under section 711.1(1). See State v. Spears,
312 N.W.2d 79, 80 (Iowa 1981). Section 708.1 provides, in relevant part:

"An assault as defined in this section is a general intent crime. A
person commits an assault when, without justification, the person does
any of the following:

1.  a.  Any act which is intended to cause pain or injury to, or which
        is intended to result in physical contact which will be
        insulting or offensive to another, coupled with the apparent
        ability to execute the act.

    b.  Any act which is intended to place another in fear of immediate
        physical contact which will be painful, injurious, insulting, or
        offensive, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the act.

    c.  Intentionally points any firearm toward another, or displays in
        a threatening manner any dangerous weapon toward another."

Iowa Code §708.1. In this case, the State relied upon the first two
alternatives of assault, and the district court found Keeton committed
assault under both alternatives.

Although the State asks us to resolve the sufficiency-of-evidence claim
by considering section 708.1(1)-(2) to only require a general intent
element, the specific issue on appeal in this case only requires us to
decide if the evidence in the case satisfies the statutory elements of
the crime of assault. This question can be decided without considering
whether the statutory language used to define the crime of assault
requires a specific or general intent. See Scott A. Anderegg, Note, The
Voluntary Intoxication Defense in Iowa, 73 Iowa L. Rev. 935, 935 (1988)
(noting confusion regarding concepts of specific and general intent);
see also Model Penal Code §2.02, at 230 & n.3 (1985) (stating the Model
Penal Code employed four culpability distinctions in lieu of the
specific-intent/general-intent dichotomy, "which has been such an
abiding source of confusion and ambiguity in the penal law")\... . 

Accordingly, we decline to revisit the issue whether assault is a
general- or specific-intent crime in this case. Regardless of which
label is attached to the offense, the State was still required to prove
Keeton possessed the mens rea required by the statute, and we turn to
decide if it did so. State v. Taylor, 689 N.W.2d 116, 132 (Iowa 2004)
("Regardless of whether assault is a specific intent or general intent
crime, the State must prove by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that
the defendant intended his act to cause pain or injury to the victim or
to result in physical contact that would be insulting or offensive to
the victim."). The State had to prove that Keeton \... intended either:
(1) to cause the clerk pain or injury, (2) to make insulting or
offensive physical contact with the clerk, or (3) to make the clerk fear
immediate painful, injurious, insulting, or offensive physical contact.
Iowa Code §708.1(1)-(2). We turn to the evidence in the record that
bears upon this intent element.

Keeton testified that he did not intend to touch, hurt, insult, or
offend the clerk. However, intent required by the statute "may be
inferred from the circumstances of the transaction and the actions of
the defendant." 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law §128, at 214-15 (1998); see
also Taylor, 689 N.W.2d at 132 ("An actor will ordinarily be viewed as
intending the natural and probable consequences that usually follow from
his or her voluntary act.").

We begin by considering the actions of the parties to the incident. The
surveillance video of the incident offered into evidence at trial showed
that the clerk blocked one of the double doors as Keeton tried to exit
by standing in front of the door. After the clerk attempted to retrieve
the money, Keeton moved in the direction of the other door to exit, and
the clerk lunged in front of that door to block Keeton from leaving.
Keeton then backed up and began to walk toward the clerk with his hand
extended, holding the money. He then pulled his hand to his chest at the
same time as the clerk moved off to the side of the doors to permit
Keeton to exit.

This evidence could support an inference of intent to place the clerk in
fear of immediate physical contact that would be painful, injurious,
insulting, or offensive. Similarly, the evidence could support an
inference that the actions of Keeton were intended to result in physical
contact which would be insulting or offensive to the clerk. Keeton
wanted to leave the store, and his outstretched hand could evidence his
intent to push the clerk out of his path.

Furthermore, the testimony of Keeton and the testimony of the clerk at
trial provided further evidence of the intent to support the conviction
under the statute. The clerk testified she felt Keeton was "bound and
determined to keep the money," and she realized there was "no way" she
could keep him from leaving. While this testimony is not dispositive,
these perceptions are properly considered in determining intent.
Moreover, Keeton acknowledged on cross-examination that he "would have
pushed past \[the clerk\] and went out the door" if the clerk failed to
move from the exit. Although Keeton tried to retract this testimony on
redirect examination, it was nevertheless evidence of intent.

We conclude that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the
State, reveals substantial evidence to satisfy the intent element of the
crime of assault under section 708.1(1) and (2)\... . We understand
Keeton's argument that he was only attempting to leave the store to
complete his theft, not to commit an assault. Yet, this is not a case
where proof of intent depends upon a single piece of evidence from which
two reasonable inferences could be drawn. See State v. Truesdell, 679
N.W.2d 611, 618-19 (Iowa 2004) ("When two reasonable inferences can be
drawn from a piece of evidence, we believe such evidence only gives rise
to a suspicion, and, without additional evidence, is insufficient to
support guilt.") (emphasis added). The multiple actions of the
participants in this case and the inferences derived from those actions,
as well as their testimony, are together sufficient to support a finding
of the intent element of an assault under our statutory
definition\... . 

We conclude there was substantial evidence presented at trial that
Keeton committed an assault on the clerk. We affirm his conviction for
robbery in the second degree.

 

 

 

State v. Moon

 

Maine Supreme Judicial Court

755 A.2d 527, 2000 Me. 142 (2000)

Wathen, C.J.

Defendant John R. Moon appeals from a judgment entered in the Superior
Court (Penobscot County, Hjelm, J.) following a jury verdict finding him
guilty of theft (Class B), 17-A M.R.S.A. § 353 (1983). Defendant
contends that the court erred in limiting his expert's testimony, in
instructing the jury concerning the charges of theft by unauthorized
taking or transfer and theft by misapplication of property, in
instructing the jury concerning the time at which an intention to
deprive must exist, and in allowing overly remote evidence of the mental
element. Finding no error, we affirm.

The relevant facts may be summarized as follows: Defendant, while
working on his M.B.A. degree at the University of Maine at Orono, was
recruited to be a resident advisor of the Sigma Chi Fraternity house.
After the local chapter of the Sigma Chi was closed, he was again
recruited by alumni of the Rho Rho Chapter of Sigma Chi to resurrect the
chapter at the University. He was hired as director of the fundraising
campaign, project manager of the renovation project, and live-in
resident advisor. He also served, without compensation, as treasurer of
the Rho Rho Chapter. During the period defendant was treasurer, he
transferred funds from the fraternity's bank accounts on numerous
occasions to either himself personally or to Marsh Island Development
Company (MIDCO), a corporation in which he was a significant
shareholder. He used the funds primarily to renovate a four-story brick
townhouse located at 137 Main Street, Bangor, with the intention of then
obtaining conventional residential financing. In the end, he was unable
to obtain residential financing. He concealed these transfers from the
Board of Trustees of the fraternity and obtained no authorization from
the Board. During the period defendant was taking the funds, his
personal bank balances were low and he incurred substantial debt, the
proceeds of which he used in part to repay the fraternity. Defendant
continued to take funds even when he knew that obtaining the residential
financing would be difficult. He admits that from 1991 to 1994 he took
approximately \$120,000.00, returned over \$100,000.00, and still owes
\$19,972.41.

His defense at trial focused on demonstrating that he had no intent to
deprive. He argued that he always intended to repay the money and that
he believed he had \$110,000.00 in equity in his Main Street property to
cover the money he had taken. To support his defense, defendant
testified himself as to his intent and also introduced the testimony of
Gregory Noonan, a certified fraud examiner, certified public accountant
and attorney. Noonan testified before the jury as follows: Defendant
kept a separate account entitled "accounts receivable-other" in the
journal and properly recorded each transaction in which defendant either
took funds from the fraternity or returned funds. It was significant
that defendant included no other receivables within the "accounts
receivable-other" account, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and important that he included none of these
transfers in the general accounts receivable account, which would have
been improper because he was an employee. As a result, according to
Noonan, defendant left a very good audit trail so that it was easy for
an auditor to trace the transactions back to the check register and
determine that the funds were made payable to John Moon or MIDCO.
Noonan's review of the records confirmed that during the period from
1991 to 1994 the total amount that went to defendant was \$123,477.86
and the amount repaid by defendant was approximately \$103,505.00,
leaving a balance of approximately \$19,000.00.

Defendant was indicted in 1997 for theft by unauthorized taking or
transfer in violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. § 353 (1983) and subsequently
indicted for theft by misapplication of property.... In a trial on the
consolidated counts, defendant was found guilty of theft in violation of
17-A M.R.S.A. § 353 and now appeals.

1.  Exclusion of Expert Testimony

Despite the fact that Noonan testified at length, defendant now argues
that the court erred by refusing to let him introduce the expert
testimony of Noonan that would explain to the lay person how the
financial records were kept, how the records created an audit trail, and
how the audit trail was inconsistent with all methods of obscuring theft
in the books of a business. In fact, the court excluded only the last
element of Noonan's testimony. In voir dire, Noonan testified that there
are four basic "embezzlement schemes," i.e., lapping a/k/a kiting,
fictitious receivables, diverting payments in old written off
receivables, and borrowing against receivables; that in fourteen years
of experience he has not seen a situation of account receivable or cash
fraud that fell outside of these four categories; and this case is
distinguished because "every transaction was documented right to the T."

The court refused to allow this portion of Noonan's testimony on the
basis of relevancy ... and jury confusion.... The court determined that
the expert's testimony dealt with embezzlement schemes, that defendant
was charged with theft, and that embezzlement and theft are not
necessarily co-extensive. It further found that the testimony could
confuse the jurors because Noonan's audit standards for the embezzlement
schemes differ from the statutory elements of theft.

We review evidentiary rulings on relevancy and prejudicial effect for
clear error or an abuse of discretion....  Evidence is relevant if it
has "any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of
consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less
probable than it would be without the evidence." M.R. Evid. 401....

The jury had the expert's testimony, without the proffered portion, that
explained how the financial records were kept and how the records
created an audit trail. This evidence, without the proffered evidence,
supported defendant's argument that because of his meticulous record
keeping and because he returned a substantial portion of the funds, he
did not intend to deprive the fraternity of the funds permanently, but
instead intended to repay the debt. Moreover, whether defendant's
conduct conforms with historical patterns of embezzlement is irrelevant
to whether defendant committed theft by unauthorized taking ....

Simply because a person is clever enough to devise a new method of
committing a theft that does not conform with a known existing
embezzlement scheme, or foolhardy enough to document his activity, does
not make it less probable that the crime of theft was committed.
Although defendant and his expert witness focused on his intent to repay
the money to support his contention that he did not intend to deprive
the fraternity of the funds permanently, see 17-A M.R.S.A. § 352(3)(A),
they ignored the patent possibility that he committed theft in violation
of the statute by using the fraternity's money "under circumstances that
make it unlikely that the owner will recover it." 17-A M.R.S.A. §
352(3)(C). Accordingly, the expert's testimony concerning embezzlement
schemes is not relevant and does not tend to prove that defendant lacked
the intent to deprive based on the complete statutory definition of
theft.

1.  Jury Instructions

... Defendant also argues that the court erred because it refused to
provide his proposed jury instructions which emphasized that the
necessary mental element of intent to deprive must exist "at the time of
the taking." Defendant's proposed instruction stated in relevant part:

This intent to deprive the true owner of the property must have existed
at the time that the unauthorized control first took place\.... \[I\]f
you find that the Defendant exercised unauthorized control over the
fraternity's money, you must then examine the evidence whether, at the
time Defendant began exercising unauthorized control, he then and there
had the intent to deprive the fraternity of that money.

The court instructed the jury as follows:

A person commits the crime of theft \... if that person obtains or
exercises unauthorized control over the property of another with the
intent, at the time he obtains or exercises unauthorized control over
the property, to deprive the owner thereof.

The difference between the instructions is that defendant sought to
limit the criminal act to a single point in time, namely, "the time
Defendant began exercising unauthorized control," for the purpose of
determining the presence of the required mental element. The
distinction, however, if any, is not relevant in this case. Even if
defendant intended to repay the funds at the precise moment he took
them, he nonetheless consciously used the money in a way which the jury
could find made it unlikely that the fraternity would recover it, in
violation of section 352(3)(C)....

The entry is: Judgment affirmed.

1 The statute provides as follows:

1\. A person is guilty of theft if he obtains or exercises unauthorized
control over the property of another with intent to deprive him thereof.

2\. As used in this section, \"exercises unauthorized control" includes
but is not necessarily limited to conduct heretofore defined or known as
common law larceny by trespassory taking, larceny by conversion, larceny
by bailee and embezzlement.

17-A M.R.S.A. § 353 (1983). \"Intent to deprive" is defined by statute
as follows: \"Intent to deprive" means to have the conscious object:

A. To withhold property permanently or for so extended a period or to
use under such circumstances that a substantial portion of its economic
value, or the use and benefit thereof, would be lost; or

B. To restore the property only upon payment of a reward or other
compensation; or

C. To use or dispose of the property under circumstances that make it
unlikely that the owner will recover it or that manifest an indifference
as to whether the owner will recover it.

**\[ ... \]**

DORMAN, Chief Judge:

A military judge sitting as a special court-martial convicted the
appellant, pursuant to his pleas, of a false official statement and
larceny. The appellant's crimes violated Articles 107 and 121, Uniform
Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. §§ 907 and 921. The adjudged and
approved sentence consists of a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for
45 days, and reduction to pay grade E-l. In taking action the convening
authority waived automatic forfeiture of pay for 6 months from the date
of the action.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xfbe9ffb5daaa0d7ff2df7e819be3a6ee4865241)

This case was initially submitted without assignment of error. In our
initial review of the record, we specified an issue to counsel
concerning whether the appellant's guilty plea to larceny was provident.
**\[ ... \]**

The appellant pleaded guilty to the theft of several items of special
operations equipment, such as a force vest, canteen covers, and a duty
belt (hereinafter referred to as "gear"). The total value of the stolen
gear exceeded \$500.00. The gear belonged to another Marine. **\[ ...
\]**

The appellant was serving in Al Hillah, Iraq, when he took the gear he
was charged with stealing. The gear was located in an open box, and, at
the time he took it, the appellant did not know who owned the gear. The
appellant found the box in a room that he and others had been told to
clean out in preparation for another platoon's arrival. Unit personnel
had previously used this room to store their packs. The room contained
several boxes that they had been instructed to dispose of, including the
box containing the gear. As they cleaned out the room, they discovered
items that were never picked up by their owners and appeared to have
been left behind for trash. The appellant took the box from a room where
unit personnel had been storing their packs and he brought it to his
rack. There was no name on the gear, but the appellant knew it did not
belong to him. The appellant was the first one to find the box
containing the gear. The appellant also knew that the items should not
have been discarded. He went up and down the passageway asking whether
anyone had left a box of gear in the room. He asked almost the entire
platoon. When he could not determine who owned the gear, he decided to
use it himself.

The appellant used the gear for about a month while going on patrols.
The use continued until his section leader confronted him about whether
the gear belonged to him. Initially, the appellant told the section
leader that he had purchased the gear. This false statement was
prosecuted under Article 107, UCMJ. The appellant did not learn who
owned the gear until after he had surrendered it. The owner was a member
of the appellant's battalion, and the appellant was acquainted with him.
The appellant informed the military judge that if he had not been
confronted by the command, he would have continued to use the gear.

As the providence inquiry continued, the appellant then answered "yes"
or "no" to a series of questions dealing with the legality of his
actions. He admitted that he knew it was wrongful to take the gear, that
the gear was not abandoned, that he intended to permanently deprive the
owner of the gear, that he had no legal justification or excuse for his
actions, and that he took and retained the gear with a criminal state of
mind. Record at 13-22**\[ ... \]**

The appellant now argues that his plea is improvident because the
military judge failed to adequately inquire into the "apparent defense
of ignorance or mistake of fact as to whether the gear \... was
abandoned, lost, or mislaid." Appellant's Brief of 31 May 2005 at 6
(footnote omitted). The Government counters**\[ ... \]** that the pleas
are provident, with no discussion of the law concerning abandoned, lost
or mislaid property.**\[ ... \]**

Before accepting a guilty plea, the military judge must explain the
elements of the offense and ensure that a factual basis for the plea
exists. **\[ ... \]**Mere conclusions of law recited by the accused are
insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea. **\[ ...
\]**The accused "must be convinced of, and able to describe all the
facts necessary to establish guilt." Rule for Courts-Martial 910(e),
Manual for Courts-Martial**\[ ... \]** Acceptance of a guilty plea
requires the accused to substantiate the facts that objectively support
his plea. **\[ ... \]**

The standard of review to determine whether a plea is provident is
whether the record reveals a substantial basis in law and fact for
questioning the plea. *United States v. Prater,* 32 M.J. 433, 436
(C.M.A.1991). Such rejection must overcome the generally applied waiver
of the factual issue of guilt inherent in voluntary pleas of guilty**\[
... \]**An abuse of discretion standard is applied in reviewing the
question of whether a military judge erred in accepting a guilty plea.
**\[ ... \]**

In our review of the record, we determined that the military judge
accurately listed the elements of larceny and defined the terms relevant
to those elements. Record at 11-13. We also determined that the
appellant indicated an understanding of the elements of the offense and
that he acknowledged that they correctly described what he did. *Id.* at
13. Thereafter, the military judge conducted an inquiry with the
appellant to determine whether a factual basis for the plea existed. The
inquiry went well until such time as the appellant essentially informed
the military judge that the gear he took had been left in the room as
trash. *Id.* at 19. After that point, most of the questions asked by the
military judge called for a "yes" or "no" answer, and many called for
legal conclusions. *Id.* at 19-22.

Abandoned property cannot be the subject of a larceny. *United States v.
Malone,* 14 M.J. 563, 564 (N.M.C.M.R.1982);[^11] *United States v.
Allison,* 30 M.J. 546, 547 (A.C.M.R.1990)(citing *United States v.
Santulli,* 28 M.J. 651, 652 n. 2 (A.C.M.R.1989); *United States v.
Swords,* 35 C.M.R. 889, 894, 1965 WL 4760 (A.F.B.R.1965)). The
appellant's statement to the military judge that the gear had been left
there as trash raised the issue of mistake of fact. Furthermore, since
larceny is a specific intent offense, if the appellant had an honest
belief that the property was abandoned, he has a complete defense.
R.C.M. 916(j); *Malone,* 14 M.J. at 565.

For a complex offense such as conspiracy, robbery, or murder, a failure
to discuss and explain the elements of the offense during the providence
inquiry has been held to be fatal to the guilty plea on appeal. *United
States v. Pretlow,* 13 M.J. 85, 88-89 (C.M.A.1982)**\[ ... \]**.
Similarly, a military judge should explain the elements of defenses,
such as mistake of fact and abandonment, if raised by the appellant
during the providence inquiry.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X67e05d707ac56219785c5f3a02140f35ca8f119) If during the plea
inquiry an accused "reasonably raises the question of a defense,"
*United States v. Timmins,* 45 C.M.R. 249, 253, 1972 WL 14168
(C.M.A.1972)(concerning the mistake of fact defense), or " 'sets up
matter inconsistent ■with the plea'\... the military judge must either
resolve the apparent inconsistency or reject the plea." *United States
v. Garcia,* 44 M.J. 496, 498 (C.A.A.F.1996)(quoting Art. 45(a), UCMJ).
**\[ ... \]**.

In the ease before us, the military judge failed to explain the mistake
of fact defense to the appellant. Although the military judge did ask
the appellant if he believed the gear was abandoned, he did not provide
the appellant with the legal definition of abandoned property. A reading
of the case law with respect to this issue makes clear that the legal
significance of the term "abandoned" is not one that would be "commonly
known and understood by servieemembers." *Id.*

Applying the standards of review noted above, we conclude that the
record reveals a substantial basis in law and fact to question the
appellant's guilty plea to larceny. Thus, we conclude that the military
judge erred by failing to inform the appellant of the defense of mistake
of fact and the definitions and legal significance of abandoned
property. He did not adequately resolve the issue of mistake of fact.
When the appellant informed the military judge that the gear had been
left behind as trash, the military judge inappropriately asked the
appellant "yes" or "no" type questions that called for legal
conclusions. *Jordan,* 57 M.J. at 239. By not explaining the relevant
legal terms, the military judge denied the appellant the ability to make
an informed decision concerning the answers he provided. In light of
these errors, we conclude that the appellant's guilty pleas to Charge II
and its specification are not provident**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the findings to Charge II and its specification are set
aside. The remaining findings are affirmed. In light of our action on
the findings, the case is returned to the Judge Advocate General for
referral to an appropriate convening authority. **\[ ... \]**

 

 

 

Notes on theft and property status

 

Some U.S. jurisdictions distinguish between *abandoned, lost,*
and *mislaid* property, and those distinctions can be relevant to
criminal liability for theft. See, e.g., United States v. Malone, 14
M.J. 563, 564 (N.M.C.M.R. 1982):

*Abandoned personal property* is that property which the owner has
thrown away. In doing so, the owner relinquishes all right to, and
possession of, the goods with no intent to reclaim them. Property which
has been abandoned by the owner may be acquired by the first finder.
Such a first finder is not a thief.

*Lost personal property* is property which the owner has involuntarily
parted with because of negligence, carelessness, or other nonvoluntary
means (e.g., theft). There is no intent to part with the ownership of
such property. Personal property is lost when "accidentally dropped in
any public place, public thoroughfare, or street . . . . In short,
property will not be considered to have been lost unless the
circumstances are such that considering the place where and the
conditions under which it is found, there is an inference that it was
left there unintentionally."

*Mislaid personal property* is property which the owner voluntarily and
intentionally lays down in a place where he can again resort to it ---
then he forgets where he left it. Further,

If the owner laid the property down in a public place, in a place of
business, as in a private compartment of a safe-deposit company, or
other place, and then forgets that he has done so, and hence cannot find
it  . . .  it is not lost, but mislaid, property which is still in the
constructive possession of the owner. Id. §3.

An individual who finds *mislaid* personal property, such as the radio
and scanner in this case, has no right to its initial possession . . . .
\[One who finds\] mislaid property may be guilty of larceny even though
there are no clues that would assist in locating the owner. In the
instant case, the occupants of the cubicle had a superior right of
possession as against any finder except the true owner.

The finder of *lost* personal property is not in as precarious a
position as the finder of *mislaid* personal property. Paragraph 200a(8)
of the Manual for Courts-Martial notes:

A taking or withholding of lost property by the finder is larceny if
accompanied by an intent to steal and if a clue to the identity of the
 . . .  owner, or through which such identity may be traced, is
furnished by the character, location, or marking of the property, or by
other circumstances.  . . . 

\[If property has\] been left by its owner next to the couch with an
intent to later retrieve it \..., although the owner has exposed the
property to theft, he has not given up possession nor consented to the
taking. 

 

 

 

Simms v. District of Columbia

 

District of Columbia Court of Appeals

612 A.2d 215 (1992)

ROGERS, Chief Judge:

Following a bench trial before Hearing Commissioner John W. King,
appellant was found guilty of tampering with a vehicle in violation of
18 DCMR § 1105.2(a) (1986), and sentenced under 18 DCMR § 1110.1 to a
\$160.00 fine and ten days imprisonment; the sentence was suspended and
appellant was placed on six months' probation.... The trial judge
affirmed the commissioner's decision. Appellant now contends that the
hearing commissioner erroneously refused to consider appellant's
defenses of abandonment and mistake of fact.... We affirm.

I

At approximately 7:30 p.m. on May 3, 1990, Captain Joseph Amady of the
Metropolitan Police Department observed a group of people attempting to
raise a parked Volkswagen Jetta automobile onto the crane of a tow
truck. Appellant was standing near a jack and he was placing boards
underneath the car. Captain Ama-dy also testified that the police
department previously had recovered numerous stolen cars in the same
location and that the Jetta being towed did not appear to have been
there long. After a computerized check identified the Jetta as a stolen
vehicle, Captain Amady charged appellant with tampering with a vehicle.

Linda Hancock, who was present at the time of appellant's arrest,
testified that after she had told appellant that she needed a grill and
fender for her own Jetta, he escorted her to the stolen Jetta. According
to her, before the police arrived appellant examined the stolen Jetta's
fender and said, "It might work." He then placed a tire on the Jetta so
the tow truck could move it. Ms. Hancock described the car as "an
abandoned Jetta in the bushes."

Shawn Clayton, a defense witness, testified that the Jetta looked
abandoned to him, since he had seen it a couple of times over the period
of a month. He also testified that he overheard appellant talking to
someone named Darryl about a request for Jetta parts; appellant told
Darryl that he had seen the Jetta in Brandywine Alley, that the "windows
are busted out of it\_ \[and\] \[i\]t looked like it's brand new," and
that he did not know if it was stolen or not.

Appellant also testified about his conversation with Darryl, and that
when Linda Hancock asked if he could acquire parts for her Jetta, he
told her that he had noticed "a Jetta abandoned" in the same place for
"approximately three weeks to a month, \[and that\] the windows are all
busted out and the car is totally destroyed." He had told her that "I
don't know if it's been stolen or abandoned, as far as I know it's
abandoned. No wheels on it an\[d\] all that. It's in bad condition." She
responded that she would get a tow truck driver, and less than two hours
later she returned with a tow truck, and her two brothers had tried to
get the Jetta hooked up to the tow truck to pull the Jetta out of the
bushes. On cross-examination, when asked if he had said he did not know
if the Jetta was stolen or abandoned, appellant explained that he knew
the Jetta did not belong to him and that he had seen the Jetta five or
six times over the three-weeks-to-a-month period.
[\...](#Xfcb2197a6433fc8bb5430d2f1803581c54e104b)

The government, in rebuttal, called Officer Simmons who testified that
he believed that the Jetta might have had a current (1991) Maryland tag
on its rear, and that it "was basically pretty much stripped" at the
time of appellant's arrest.

In finding appellant guilty, the hearing commissioner rejected
appellant's \... defense that he believed the Jetta had been abandoned
by its owner. The hearing commissioner ruled that, in general,
abandonment had to be proved by unequivocal, clear and decisive evidence
but that since appellant was not a member of any statutory class
permitted under 18 DCMR § 1105.2 to touch a vehicle *(i.e.,* the
vehicle's owner, the vehicle owner's representative or a government
official), abandonment in the nature of a mistake of fact was not a
defense. Alternatively, the commissioner ruled that "under either the
Government's theory or even the Defense theory, \[appellant,\] based on
the evidence and the facts that I have found beyond a reasonable
doubt\[,\] must be found guilty." \[T\]he trial judge \... affirmed the
decision of the hearing commissioner without opinion upon entering the
judgment and commitment order.

II

Appellant contends that the hearing commissioner erroneously rejected
his defense of mistake of fact based on the evidence that appellant
thought the stolen Jetta had been abandoned by its owner. He maintains
that although the hearing commissioner recognized that tampering under
18 DCMR § 1105.2 was a general intent crime, the commissioner concluded
that the offense was one of strict liability.

The prohibition against tampering does not ban all forms of contact with
a vehicle by individuals not within one of the statutorily exempted
groups. *See In re R.F.H.,* 354 A.2d 844 (D.C.1976). This court has
construed the word "tampering" as limiting the regulation's
applicability to those who physically contact another's vehicle with "an
improper purpose or intent." Id. at 847 (concluding that the
regulatory\' prohibition against tampering with a vehicle was not
unconstitutionally vague) (footnote omitted). The court distinguished
lawful and unlawful contact as follows:

\[The definition of tampering\] exclude\[s\] from its coverage the Good
Samaritan who is caught turning off the lights of another, because he
does not possess an unlawful purpose in acting. It would, however,
include those individuals apprehended for prying open or picking a
vehicle's lock\.... It would also include those individuals caught while
attempting to pick the lock of an automobile.

*Id.* at 847 \...

Appellant's defense that he believed the Jetta was abandoned is
essentially a defense of mistake of fact. *Williams v. United States,*
337 A.2d 772, 774 (D.C.1975). In general intent crimes, such as
tampering with another's vehicle, *see R.F.H., supra,* 354 A.2d at 847
n. 7, a defendant may interpose a mistake of fact defense if the
defendant proves "to the satisfaction of the fact finder that the
mistake was both (1) honest and (2) reasonable." *Williams, supra,* 337
A.2d at 774-75; *see also Morgan v. District of Columbia,* 476 A.2d
1128, 1132 (D.C.1984) (proof of general intent requires absence of
exculpatory state of mind such as mistake of fact). Thus, appellant's
mistake of fact defense is a proper defense to tampering with an
automobile because it can negate appellant's general intent to commit
the crime, thereby demonstrating that appellant did not physically make
contact with the stolen Jetta with an "unlawful purpose." *R.F.H.,
supra,* 354 A.2d at 847 \...

However, where the mistake of fact is based on a claim that the
defendant mistakenly believed property had been abandoned by its owner,
the court has also stated that:

An abandonment must be made to appear affirmatively by the party relying
on it, and an intention to abandon will not ordinarily be presumed, and
this is particularly true if the conduct of the owner can be explained
consistently with a continued claim. Proof of abandonment must be made
by the one asserting it by clear, unequivocal and decisive evidence.

*Peyton v. United States,* 275 A.2d 229, 230 (D.C.1971) \... The precise
relationship between the requirement that an abandonment must be shown
by clear, unequivocal and decisive evidence, and the requirement that a
defendant demonstrate that his belief that property was abandoned was
honest and reasonable, is not immediately clear. Peyton's \... language
might suggest that the focus should be on whether the lawful owner
intended to abandon the property, and that a mistake of fact defense
resting on a belief that the property was abandoned is somehow different
from other mistake of fact defenses, requiring the defendant to satisfy
a more burdensome standard of proof by clear, unequivocal and decisive
evidence. But that is not, and indeed, could not be, the case. *See
Mullaney v. Wilbur,* 421 U.S. 684, 702 \... (1975) (fact that intent is
"peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant" does not justify
shifting burden to defendant); *In re Winship,* 397 U.S. 358, 364, \...
(1970) (Due Process Clause places burden on government to prove every
element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt) \...

A mistake of fact defense based on a defendant's belief that property
was abandoned by its owner necessarily turns on the defendant's
reasonable belief and not on the lawful owner\'s actual intention to
abandon his or her property. *See* W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive
Criminal Law ch. 5 § 5.1(b), at 581 ("the general principle \[is\] that
ignorance or mistake of fact or law is a defense only if it negates a
required mental state \[of defendant\]"). Therefore, as with any other
mistake of fact defense to a general intent crime, the defense of
abandonment rests on whether the defendant's belief was honest and
reasonable, *see Williams, supra,* 337 A.2d at 774-75, and is not a
special kind of mistake of fact defense placing a heavier burden on the
defendant.

The question remains whether the hearing commissioner's ruling that
appellant could not interpose a mistake of fact defense was harmless
error. [\...](#Xc4492d8b1105fae6512285feab087f87baa7f6b)  The
commissioner did not state that appellant's only burden was to show that
his mistake was both honest and reasonable. Rather, the commissioner
focused initially on the fact that appellant would not have been
entitled to a jury instruction because he did not fall within one of the
three statutory classes of people entitled to touch a vehicle.
Therefore, the commissioner concluded that no such defense was available
to appellant. However, thereafter the commissioner made an alternative
ruling, that even under the defense theory the evidence established
beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty. The only theory
presented by the defense \... was that appellant had thought that the
Jetta was abandoned.

The factual findings underlying the commissioner's ruling are supported
by the evidence and are not clearly erroneous. \... The findings
relevant to the mistake of fact defense were that, according to
appellant and Mr. Clayton, the Jetta had been in the alley for about a
month and did not have any windows or wheels and looked like it needed
parts. Further, appellant had stated that he did not know whether the
car was abandoned or stolen. The transcript makes clear that appellant
did not testify that he believed the car was abandoned by its owner.
Rather, just prior to the tampering incident, he admitted to others that
he did not know whether the car had been abandoned or stolen. The
commissioner could reasonably infer that appellant's admission reflected
that he knew there was an alternative explanation for the vehicle's
condition that was consistent with a continuous claim of ownership by
the Jetta's owner. The fact that the Jetta had been stripped of its
tires and radio and had its windshield broken, muchless its location in
the bushes, did not require the commissioner to credit appellant's
defense. Abandonment cannot be presumed merely because of the location
and condition of the car since those circumstances "\[could\] be
explained consistently with a continued claim" by the owner. *Peyton,
supra,* 275 A.2d at 230. The Jetta was only about two years old, and had
a current registration tag on the rear. Appellant never disputed that
the car had a current license plate on it. The Jetta also was in an area
where numerous stolen vehicles had previously been recovered by the
police, although, admittedly, there was no showing that appellant had
reason to be aware of this fact. However, there also was no testimony of
any structural damage to the body of the car that would suggest that the
Jetta's damage resulted from an automobile accident. Thus, there was
sufficient evidence for the commissioner to find that appellant realized
that the car might not be abandoned.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment \....

MINER, Circuit Judge.

Defendants-appellants, Chen Xiang ("Chen") and Lin Xian Wu ("Lin") **\[

States District Court for the Southern District of New York **\[ ...
\]** following a jury trial, convicting each of the Appellants, under a
superseding indictment, of one count of conspiracy to commit extortion,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 **\[ ... \]**; one count of extortion,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1951 **\[ ... \]**; three counts of

Appellants contend that the evidence adduced at trial to prove their

conspiracy to commit extortion was insufficient as a matter of law. We
agree and, accordingly, reverse the convictions of Appellants under
Counts One and Two. **\[ ... \]**We , affirm the judgments of the
District Court in all other respects.

BACKGROUND

**\[ ... \]**

The charges in the Indictment have their genesis in a series of
robberies and related incidents that occurred in Manhattan's "Chinatown"
during a six-month period between the summer of 2001 and the early
months of 2002.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xb82795d2aff169f00190431b19162ef3618e8f1) The first such incident
occurred in or around July 2001 at 75' Eldridge Street --- an illegal
gambling parlor located behind a clothing store.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X5bfa88ee5db14156c68139e572edf963d6210b5) On or about July 23,
2001, at approximately 6:00 p.m., an unknown caller telephoned Chen Tin
Hua ("Hua"), a "shareholder" in the gambling operation, and identified
himself as being associated with "Vietnamese Boy" --- presumably,
co-defendant/cooperating witness Xiao Qin Zhou ("Xiao"). The caller
stated that Vietnamese Boy would come to the gambling parlor later that
day to pick up \$10,000, which the caller instructed Hua to place in a
red envelope. Hua told the caller that he had no money and hung up.

Later that evening, while in the parlor, Hua was summoned outside by a
group of men demanding to speak with him. Awaiting Hua were Appellants
--- Chen and Lin --- along with Xiao and co-defendant Li Wei. All four
pointed guns at Hua, and Xiao demanded that he give them \$10,000. Hua
told the group that he had no money. Xiao struck Hua on the head, and Li
Wei, using his gun, struck Hua in the stomach. Xiao then ripped a
necklace from around Hua's neck, and the group fled the scene in a
vehicle**\[ ... \]**

DISCUSSION

I. *Sufficiency of the Evidence*

As noted above, Appellants contend that the evidence adduced at trial
was insufficient to sustain the convictions of Appellants on the
extortion-related crimes charged in Counts One and Two and,
concomitantly, on the firearm crime charged in Count Three. **\[ ...
\]**

In order to prove a conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 ("the
Hobbes Act"), the Government must show that two or more persons entered
into an agreement to commit the substantive offense as charged. **\[ ...
\]**"In order to convict a given defendant of conspiracy, the
\[G\]overnment must prove that he knew of the conspiracy and joined it
with the intent to commit the offenses that were its objectives, that
is, with the affirmative intent to make the conspiracy succeed." *United
States v. Ceballos,* 340 F.3d 115, 123-24 (2d Cir.2003) **\[ ... \]**

Here, the object of the alleged conspiracy was to commit extortion,
which, in the context of federal crimes, in relevant part, "means the
obtaining of property from another, *with, his consent,* induced by
wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear." 18
U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2) (emphasis added). Extortion is frequently
exemplified by "revenue-producing measures \... utilized by organized
crime to generate income"---measures "such as shakedown rackets and
loan-sharking." *United States v. Nardello,* 393 U.S. 286, 295**\[ ...
\]** (1969).[**\[ ... \]**](#Xbf400f7a998510c584903e22de19a0fe13ef01b)

Choice on the part of the victim is a common theme in all extortion
cases. As noted above, "the Hobbs Act definition of coercion speaks of
obtaining property from another 'with his consent.' " *United States v.
Arena,* 180 F.3d 380, 394 (2d Cir.1999). Indeed, "\[t\]he legislative
history of the Act makes clear that its proponents understood extortion
to encompass situations in which a victim is given the option of
relinquishing some property immediately or risking unlawful violence
resulting in other losses, and he simply *chooses* what he perceives to
be the lesser harm." *Id.* at 395 **\[ ... \]**"In order to foreclose
any argument by an extortionist that the relinquishment of property in
such circumstances was \[truly\] voluntary, \[however,\] the Hobbs Act
definition of extortion simply prohibits the extortionist from forcing
the victim to make such a choice." *Id.*

At bottom, undeniably, the victim of an extortion acts from fear,
whether of violence or exposure. But both the language of the statute
and the relevant precedents make clear that he or she always retains
some degree of choice in whether to comply with the extortionate threat,
however much of a Hobson's choice that may be. Indeed, this element of
consent is the razor's edge that distinguishes extortion from robbery,
which, in contrast, is defined in pertinent part as

> the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person
> or in the presence of another, *against his will,* by means of actual
> or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or
> future, to his person or property, or property in his custody or
> possession, or the person or property of a relative or member of his
> family or of anyone in his company at the time of the taking or
> obtaining.

18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(1) (emphasis added).

Among the essential elements of the federal crime of extortion, then,
are (i) the defendant's "use of actual or threatened force, violence, or
fear," and (ii) the victim's consent --- however forced --- to the
transfer of the property. 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). And concordantly,
essential to a determination of conspiracy to commit extortion are (i)
an agreement to use actual or threatened force to obtain property with
the consent of the victim and (ii) actions taken in affirmative
furtherance of that agreement. **\[ ... \]**

Here, the Government's theory is that Appellants conspired to extort ---
and in fact committed extortion, and not robbery--- when they "informed
Hua by telephone that \[Xiao\] was coming to the gambling parlor to
collect \$10,000 from him," instructing him to leave the money for
Xiao's pick-up in a red envelope, and, later, when they "summoned Hua
outside the parlor and attempted to collect the money that had been
demanded in the extortionate telephone call." The Government contends
that "\[t\]his call clearly represented a request, albeit under duress,
for the money, rather than a forcible taking." "After all," the
Government observes, "robbers typically do not telephone in their
requests to victims ahead of time." In making this distinction between
robbery and extortion, however, the Government fails to identify any
element of "duress," either express or implied, in the telephone call,
thus calling into question whether the Government has proved each and
every element of the extortion-related crimes charged in the
Indictment**\[ ... \]**

Hua, the victim of the 75 Eldridge Street crime, testified as follows
regarding the above-noted telephone call that he received on July 23,
2001:

Hua further testified that four individuals came to 75 Eldridge Street
at approximately 8:00 p.m. on July 23, 2001. These individuals asked
another employee of the gambling parlor to summon Hua outside. When Hua
went outside, four individuals were waiting, pointing guns at him.
Thereafter, Xiao, aka "Vietnamese Boy," asked Hua for \$10,000. When Hua
said that he had no money, one of the other men poked Hua in the side
with his gun, and Xiao hit Hua on his head. Xiao then ripped the
necklace from Hua's neck, after which all four of the men got into a car
and drove off**\[ ... \]**

The Indictment clearly and expressly charges Appellants with conspiring
"to commit extortion, as the term is defined in \[18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2)
\], by conspiring to obtain property from and with the consent of
others, \... which consent would be and was induced by the wrongful use
of actual and threatened force, violence and fear." The jury charge,
too, expressly recited "the victim's con\[s\]ent" as an element of
extortion. There is nothing in the Record, however, to suggest that
there was an agreement to obtain the property of either Hua or the
gambling operation at 75- El-dridge by consent --- forced or
otherwise.\' An inference may fairly be drawn that Appellants and others
agreed to visit the 75 Eldridge Street parlor- to rob it, but that is
all.

In particular, the evidence establishes that on at least eight separate
occasions, Xiáo discussed an agreement between himself, Appellants, and
others. But each time the criminal conduct was discussed, it was in
terms of a robbery. Extortion was neither spoken of nor apparently ever
contemplated. Indeed, not a single fact was elicited from Xiao that
could lead to an inference that a co-conspirator planned, or agreed, to
*extort* --- as opposed to rob --- the gambling parlor at 75 Eldridge
Street or any individual at that location.

Again, absent from the Record is any indication that Appellants thought,
or sought, to obtain property from Hua, or anyone else at 75 Eldridge
Street, by means of a forced consent. Rather, the Record supports an
agreement among, and an actual effort by, Appellants and others to get a
person at that location to .open a door so that Appellants and others
could enter the establishment and rob it. Indeed, this very method of
robbery was discussed. But the only evidence that even arguably can be
identified as indicating extortion came from Hua, who testified that he
was gambling at the 75 Eldridge Street parlor when he received a phone
call, either from Xiao or someone on Xiao's behalf.

Hua testified that the caller demanded \$10,000. Hua refused and hung up
the phone. Later, Hua was summoned to come outside the parlor, where he
was confronted by Xiao, Appellants, and another gangster, all of whom
were pointing guns at Hua. Xiao demanded \$10,000, and Hua refused,
informing the gangsters that, he had no money. Xiao then hit Hua in the
head, grabbing the chain from around his neck, and the gang fled. Xiao
testified that the chain was later sold and that he, Appellant, and Li
Wei then split the proceeds. It seems inescapable that this incident was
nothing more nor less than a classic robbery.

Absent from Hua's testimony is any suggestion that either Appellant was
even involved in the alleged extortionate phone call. Hua's testimony
was inconsistent as to the identity of the caller, and he never
identified either of the Appellants as the caller. *\[Also\]*absent from
Hua's testimony is any suggestion that the call itself conveyed any
degree of threat --- implied or express, violent or otherwise. Thus,
**\[ ... \]**the evidence does not support any inference of a threat in
the phone call.

The Government contends,- however, that the fact of the phone call
*combined* with the facts surrounding the gang's visit to 75 Eldridge
reasonably supports the inference that the purpose of the call was to
extort, since the demand for \$10,000, which was initially made by
telephone, was then repeated by the gang in person before they resorted
to violence and took the chain. Thus, concludes the Government, the
phone call was both an attempted extortion and an act in furtherance of
an extortion conspiracy. But again, there was no testimony that the call
itself was threatening in any way. **\[ ... \]**

The caller recited no consequences --- deleterious or otherwise --- of a
failure to tender the \$10,000, and no evidence was put before the jury
suggesting that any such consequences were implied by the caller or
understood implicitly by Hua. Moreover, there was nothing in Hua's
testimony from which one could reasonably infer that he was placed in a
subjective state of fear, or felt threatened in any way, by the call.
Hua testified that Xiao "was somewhat familiar" to him; that he had seen
Xiao "once or twice in Chinatown"; -and that he knew Xiao by the name
"Vietnamese \[B\]oy." But Hua said nothing from which a juror could
reasonably infer that Xiao was feared in the neighborhood or known to be
involved in criminal activities; nor was there anything else in the
Record to support such an inference.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X7e73111872c32aeeeba15590063eae7b3632a3f) If the name "Vietnamese
Boy" was intended to strike fear in the heart of Hua, there is simply no
evidence that it in fact did so. Indeed, that Hua hung up the phone
after stating simply that he had no money suggests that he saw no
negative consequences in refusing to consent to the demand or, for that
matter, in ignoring the call altogether**\[ ... \]**

A robbery plus a cryptic and ambiguous phone call does not equal
extortion --- at least, not on the facts presented to us in this
case**\[ ... \]**

In light of all the foregoing, we conclude that thé evidence put forward
by the Government to prove the charged extortion and conspiracy to
extort, even viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was
insufficient as a matter of law to prove the crimes charged in Counts
One and Two of the Indictment. At best, the evidence proves an uncharged
conspiracy to rob, and the robbery of, an individual at 75 Eldridge
Steet. Accordingly, we reverse the convictions of Appellants under
Counts One and Two, for the crimes of conspiracy to extort and
extortion, respectively**\[ ... \]**

KEARSE, Circuit Judge:

Defendants Autumn Jackson, Jose Medina, and Boris Sabas appeal from
judgments of conviction entered in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York following a jury trial **\[ ...
\]***.* Jackson and Medina were convicted of threatening to injure
another person's reputation with the intent to extort money, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 875(d) and 2 (1994); all three defendants were
convicted of traveling across state lines to promote extortion, in
violation of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1952(a)(3) and 2 (1994), and
conspiring to commit extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (1994).
Sabas was found not guilty of making extortionate threats. Jackson,
Medina, and Sabas were sentenced principally to 26, 63, and 3 months'
imprisonment, respectively**\[ ... \]**. On appeal, defendants contend
chiefly that the district court failed to give proper jury instructions
as to the nature of extortion. For the reasons that follow, we agree,
and we accordingly vacate the judgments and remand for a new trial.

I. BACKGROUND

The present prosecution arises out of defendants' attempts to obtain up
to \$40 million from William H. ("Bill") Cosby, Jr., a well-known actor
and entertainer, by threatening to cause tabloid newspapers to publish
Jackson's claim to be Cosby's daughter out-of-wedlock. **\[ ...
\]**Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence
showed the following.

A. *Jackson's Relationship With Cosby*

In the early 1970s, Cosby had a brief extramarital affair with Jackson's
mother, Shawn Thompson. After Jackson was born in 1974, Thompson told
Cosby that he was the father. Cosby disputed that assertion, and
according to Jackson's birth certificate, her father was one Gerald
Jackson. Jackson's grandmother testified, however, that she and Thompson
told Jackson, as Jackson was growing up, that Cosby was her biological
father. The grandmother told Jackson that Cosby had said that, so long
as they "didn't tell anyone about it, that he would take care of her
mother and her, and take care of his responsibility." **\[ ... \]**

For more than 20 years after Jackson's birth, Cosby provided Thompson
with substantial sums of money, provided her with a car, and paid for
her admission to substance-abuse treatment programs. **\[ ... \]**
Between 1974 and mid-1994, Cosby gave Thompson a total of more than
\$100,000, typically having traveler's checks or cashier's checks issued
in the name of an employee rather than his own name. In 1994, Cosby
established a trust fund for Thompson, which was administered by John P.
Schmitt, a partner in the New York City law firm that represented Cosby.
The trust fund provided Thompson with \$750 a week for as long as Cosby
chose to fund the trust. Thompson received approximately \$100,000 in
payments from this fund from mid-1994 until the fund was exhausted, and
not replenished, in early 1997.

In addition, Cosby, who had funded college educations for some 300
persons outside of his own immediate family, and had spoken with Jackson
by telephone at least once during her childhood, had offered to pay for
the education of Jackson and of Thompson's other two children. In about
1990, after a telephone conversation with Jackson's grandmother, Cosby
became concerned that Jackson's education was being hampered by
conditions at her California home, and he arranged to have Jackson
finish high school at a preparatory school in Florida associated with a
Florida college. Cosby thereafter also created a trust to pay for
Jackson's college tuition and for certain personal expenses such as
food, rent, utilities, and medical costs while Jackson was attending
college. This trust was administered by Schmitt's law partner Susan F.
Bloom. Jackson subsequently enrolled in a community college in Florida.
While Jackson was in school, Cosby spoke with her by telephone
approximately 15 times to encourage her to pursue her education, telling
her that although he was not her father, he "loved her very, very much"
and would be a "father figure" for her. In these conversations, she
addressed him as "Mr. Cosby."

In April 1995, Bloom learned that Jackson had dropped out of college,
and Bloom therefore ceased making payments to Jackson from the college
education trust. From the spring of 1995 until December 1996, Jackson
had no contact with Cosby or any of his attorneys.

B. *The Events of December 1996 and early January 1997*

In the fall of 1996, Jackson and her then-fíancé Antonay Williams were
living in California and working for a production company in Burbank,
California, headed by Medina. Medina's company, which operated out of
his hotel suite, was attempting to produce a children's television show.
Jackson, Williams, and Sabas had acting roles in the show; along with
cooperating witness Placido Macaraeg, they also had administrative
positions. Jackson worked without pay, but she expected to receive a
commission when the television show was sold.

In December 1996, Jackson reinitiated contact with Cosby. Within a
four-day period, she telephoned him seven times and left urgent messages
asking him to return her calls. In one instance, Jackson identified
herself as "Autumn Cosby," a message that Cosby perceived as "some sort
of threat." (Tr. 850.) WTien he returned Jackson's call, he reproached
her for using his name. Jackson described the project on which she was
working, told Cosby that she was homeless, and asked him to lend her
\$2100. Cosby initially refused and suggested that she instead get an
advance from the person for whom she was working. After further
reflection, Cosby called Jackson back and agreed to send her the \$2100
she had requested, plus an additional \$900; he urged her to return to
school, and he renewed his offer to pay for *her* education. Cosby
directed his attorneys to tell Jackson that he would pay for her
education and related expenses if she returned to school, maintained a B
average, and got a part-time job. **\[ ... \]**

On January 2 and 3, 1997, Jackson spoke with Bloom and Schmitt by
telephone and asked that she be sent money for food, lodging, and
tuition. Bloom responded that Jackson had not shown that she was
enrolled in school. Bloom and Schmitt reiterated that Cosby would not
pay for Jackson's support until she enrolled in school and secured
employment for eight hours a week; they advised her that her unpaid work
at Medina's production company did not satisfy the condition that she
get a part-time job**\[ ... \]**

*\[O\]n* January 6, Jackson left a voice-mail message for Peter Lund,
president and chief executive officer of CBS, whose ■television network
currently carried Cosby's prime-time program. Stating that her name was
Autumn Jackson, Jackson said:

> I am the daughter of Doctor William Cosby, Jr. I need to speak with
> you, um, regarding**\[ ... \]**this relationship, um, that he and I
> have, and how this will affect CBS if I go to any tabloids \.... This
> is of the \... utmost importance to CBS and his, uh, welfare**\[ ...
> \]**

Later on January 7, Jackson telephoned Schmitt and asked if there was
any chance that Cosby "would send her money to live on." (Tr. 482.) When
Schmitt responded in the negative, Jackson said that if she did not
receive money from Cosby, she would have to go to the news media.
Schmitt testified that he replied that if Jackson meant that "she was
planning to go to the news media with what she believed was damaging
information and would refrain from doing so only if Mr. Cosby paid her
money, that that was extortion, that was both illegal and disgraceful."
**\[ ... \]**Jackson stated that she had "checked \[it\] out and she
knew what she was doing." **\[ ... \]**

During the week of January 6, Jackson and Medina discussed ways to
intensify the pressure on Cosby and his corporate sponsors. These
discussions **\[ ... \]**resulted in, *inter alia,* the mailing on
January 10 and 11 of company solicitation letters that, without
mentioning Cosby by name, included a paragraph referring to Jackson as
the daughter of a "CBS megastar" who was "CBS's most prized property,"
and stating that, contrary to the star's public image as an advocate of
parenting, the star had left Jackson "cold, penniless, and homeless."
**\[ ... \]** Letters containing this paragraph were sent to the
President and Vice President of the United States, the Governor of
California, the Mayor of New York City, CBS, Eastman Kodak, Philip
Morris Company, which was another Cosby sponsor, two publishing
companies that had published Cosby's books, and many other companies.
**\[ ... \]**

On January 15, 1997, after the telephone calls and letters of the week
before had failed to produce the desired results, Medina and Jackson
contacted Christopher Do-herty, a reporter for *The Globe* tabloid
newspaper. Medina and Jackson told Do-herty that Cosby was Jackson's
father and asked what her story would be worth. To support the story,
Medina described for Doherty an affidavit in which Jackson had stated
(falsely) that Cosby admitted his paternity. Medina faxed Doherty a copy
of Bloom's December 13, 1996 letter to Jackson setting out the terms
under which Cosby offered to pay Jackson's tuition. After some
negotiation of terms, Doherty agreed that *The Globe* would purchase the
rights to Jackson's story of her relationship to Cosby for \$25,000.

That evening, Doherty brought to Medina's hotel a "source agreement,"
for the signatures of both Jackson and Medina, setting forth the terms
under which *The Globe* would buy the rights to Jackson's story. **\[
... \]**

The agreement with *The Globe* was never signed. Instead, on the
following morning, January 16, Jackson faxed a copy of the agreement,
after obliterating the \$25,-000 price, to Schmitt. In addition, Jackson
faxed Schmitt a letter stating, "I need monies and I need monies now."
Jackson's letter **\[ ... \]** concluded:

> If I don't hear from you by today for a discussion about my father and
> my affairs, then I will have to have someone else in CBS to contact my
> father for me. I want to talk to my father because I need money and I
> don't want to do anything to harm my father in any way, if at all
> possible to avoid.
>
> Enclosed you will find a copy of a contract that someone is offering
> monies for my story, which is the only property I have to sell in
> order to survive.

**\[ ... \]**The fax cover letter directed Schmitt to "R.S.V.P." to
Jackson in Medina's hotel suite.

Schmitt called Jackson later that morning. Medina, Jackson, Williams,
Sabas, and Macaraeg were present when Schmitt called. With Medina
mouthing words and passing notes to Jackson, Jackson and Schmitt had the
following conversation, in which Jackson asked for \$40 million:

> SCHMITT: I, I received your letter, Autumn.
>
> JACKSON: Okay.
>
> SCHMITT: \[Clears throat\] How, how much money are you asking for,
> Autumn?
>
> JACKSON: I'm wanting to settle, once and finally.
>
> SCHMITT: What, what are you asking for?
>
> JACKSON: I'm asking for 40 million, to settle it completely \[pause\].
>
> SCHMITT: And if our answer to that is no?
>
> JACKSON: Well, like I said, I have offers, and I will go through with
> those offers.
>
> SCHMITT: And those offers are to sell your story to the Globe?
> \[Pause\]. Autumn, are you there?
>
> JACKSON: Yes I am.
>
> SCHMITT: Is that what you're referring to, the contract that you sent
> me, that, for sale to the Globe of your story?
>
> JACKSON: Them, as well as any others. \[Pause\].
>
> SCHMITT: Well, I'm, I'm sure you know the answer to that is no,
> Autumn. Thank you very much.

**\[ ... \]** Jackson asked to have her "father" call her; Schmitt
responded that Jackson's father was "Mr. Jackson," and that she should
"not expect a call from Mr. Cosby." **\[ ... \]** Macaraeg testified
that when the conversation ended, Jackson looked frustrated and told the
group that Schmitt "doesn't understand the meaning of the term
settlement," and Medina said, "if \[Cosby\] doesn't want this to get
out, he's going to have to pay a lot of money."**\[ ... \]**

Some hours later, Jackson and Medina faxed a letter to CBS president
Lund. They attached a copy of the unsigned source agreement with *The
Globe,* again with the price redacted. In the letter, which was signed
"Autumn J. Jackson-Cosby" and bore the heading "ATTENTION: PLEASE
FORWARD THIS LETTER TO MY FATHER, WILLIAM H. COSBY, JR.," Jackson said
that Cosby's failure to acknowledge her as his daughter had left her
mentally anguished and financially impoverished. **\[ ... \]**Jackson's
letter to Lund concluded:

> I am willing to decline this offer and all others upon a fair
> settlement. **\[ ... \]**. \[Cosby's\] show and his private life just
> happens \[sic \] to be one of your best properties and this disclosure
> \... could undoubtedly effect \[sic \] your ratings negatively**\[ ...
> \]**

When Schmitt informed Cosby of Jackson's demand for \$40 million
dollars, Cosby responded that he would not pay**\[ ... \]**

That afternoon, Cosby instructed Schmitt to report Jackson's threats to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI").

At the direction of the FBI agents, Schmitt telephoned Jackson for the
purpose of allowing the agents to hear and record her demands. In that
conversation, Schmitt told Jackson that Cosby had changed his mind and
now wanted to come to an arrangement with her. Schmitt asked Jackson how
much money she needed, saying her \$40 million demand was unreasonable.
Schmitt and Jackson negotiated and eventually arrived at the figure of
\$24 million. Schmitt told Jackson that she and Medina would have to
come to New York to pick up a check. Jackson said that Medina was to
receive 25 percent of the money and asked Schmitt to make out one check
for \$18 million and the other for \$6 million. Schmitt **\[ ...
\]**asked Jackson to meet him in his office the next morning to execute
a written agreement and pick up the *checks*.

That evening, Sabas drove Jackson, Medina, and Williams to the airport.
Only Jackson and Medina flew to New York; Williams remained in Los
Angeles, and Sabas allowed him to use Sabas's credit card to pay for
tickets for Jackson's and Medina's return flight to California.

On the morning of January 18, 1997, Jackson and Medina met Schmitt at
the offices of his law firm in Manhattan. Jackson and Medina reviewed a
draft agreement, prepared by Schmitt under the direction of the FBI,
which provided that, in consideration for \$24 million, Jackson and
Medina would "refrain from providing any information whatsoever about
Mr. Cosby to any third party," would "terminate any and all discussion
with \... *The Globe,"* and would "not initiate any further discussions
with *The Globe* or any other media outlet, with respect to Ms.
Jackson's story that she is the daughter of Mr. Cosby."**\[ ... \]**When
Jackson and Medina had signed, Schmitt left the room on the pretense of
getting the checks, and FBI agents entered and arrested Jackson and
Medina**\[ ... \]**

The superseding indictment alleged three counts against each defendant:
(1) conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 875(d) and the Travel Act, 18
U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; (2) interstate
transmission of threats to injure another person's reputation with the
intent to extort money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 875(d) and 2; and
(3) interstate travel in order to promote extortion, as prohibited by §
875(d) and the New York State extortion statute, N.Y. Penal Law §
155.05(2)(e)(v) **\[ ... \]**, in violation of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1952(a)(3) and 2. Following a jury trial, Jackson and Medina were
convicted on all three counts. Sabas was convicted of conspiracy and
violating the Travel Act but was acquitted on the § 875(d) extortion
count.

In a posttrial motion defendants moved for dismissal of their
convictions on the ground that § 875(d) and the New York State extortion
statute, as interpreted in the district court's jury instructions**\[
... \]**are unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. *\[T\]he*district
court denied the motion**\[ ... \]**. Judgments of conviction were
entered, defendants were sentenced as indicated above, and these appeals
followed.

II\. DISCUSSION

On appeal, Jackson and Medina contend principally that the district
court gave an erroneous jury charge on the elements of extortion as
prohibited by § 875(d) because it omitted any instruction that, in order
to convict, the jury must find that the threat to injure Cosby's
reputation was "wrongful." **\[ ... \]**Finding merit in the challenge
to the district court's instructions, we vacate and remand for a new
trial.

A. *Extortion in Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(d)*

Section 875(d), the extortion statute under which Jackson and Medina
were convicted, provides as follows:

> \(d\) Whoever, with intent to extort from any person \... any money or
> other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any
> communication containing any threat to injure the property or
> reputation of the addressee or of another \... shall be fined under
> this title or impiisoned not more than two years, or both.

18 U.S.C. § 875(d). This statute does not define the terms "extort" or
"intent to extort." At trial, Jackson asked the court to instruct the
jury that

> \[t\]o act with intent to "extort" means to act with the intent to
> obtain money or something of value from someone else, with that
> person's consent, but caused or induced by the wrongful use of fear,

and to explain that

> \[t\]he term "wrongful" in this regard means that the government must
> prove beyond a reasonable doubt, *first,* that the defendant had no
> lawful claim or right to the money or property he or she sought or
> attempted to obtain, and, sec*ond,* that the defendant knew that he or
> she had no lawful claim or right to the money or property he or she
> sought or attempted to obtain.
>
> If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether a defendant's object or
> purpose was to obtain money or other thing of value to which he or she
> was lawfully entitled, or believed he or she was lawfully entitled,
> then the defendant would not be acting in a "wrongful" manner and you
> must find him or her not guilty**\[ ... \]**

The court informed the parties that it would not give these requested
instructions, stating its view that "threatening someone's reputation
for money or a thing of value is inherently wrongful." (Tr. 1481.)
Consistent with that view, after instructing the jury that a § 875(d)
offense has four elements, to wit, (1) an interstate communication, (2)
containing a threat to reputation, (3) with intent to communicate such a
threat, (4) with intent to extort, the court described the "intent to
extort" element as follows, without mentioning any ingredient of
wrongfulness:

> The fourth element, intent to extort. The final element that the
> government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant
> you are considering acted with the intent to extort money or a thing
> of value from Bill Cosby. You should use your common sense to
> determine whether the defendant you are considering had the requisite
> intent to extort. In this connection, *to extort means to obtain money
> or a thing of value from another by use of threats to reputation.*
>
> *\...* \[I\]t is not a defense that the alleged threats to another's
> reputation are based on true facts. In other words, it is irrelevant
> whether Bill Cosby in fact is the father of Autumn Jackson. Rather,
> you must determine whether the defendant you are considering
> communicated a threat to injure Bill Cosby's reputation, and whether
> that defendant did so with intent to extort money from Bill Cosby.
>
> In addition, if you find that the government has proved beyond a
> reasonable doubt a particular defendant threatened to injure Bill
> Cosby's reputation in order to obtain money from him, *it makesno
> difference whether the defendant was actually owed any money by Bill
> Cosby or thought he or she ivas.* That is because *the law does not
> permit someone to obtain money or a thing of value by threatening to
> injure another person's reputation***\[ ... \]**

Although in connection with the counts charging conspiracy and
violations of the Travel Act the court instructed the jury that the
government was required to proved that the defendant acted with the
intent to engage in "unlawful" activity, *see* Part II.B. below, the
court did not use the words "unlawful" or "wrongful" or any equivalent
term in its instructions as to the scope of § 875(d).

The government contends that § 875(d) contains no "wrongfulness"
requirement, and that even if such a requirement is inferred, threats to
injure another person's reputation are inherently wrongful. These
arguments are not without some support. The subsection itself contains
no explicit wrongfulness requirement, and it parallels a subsection that
prohibits, with intent to extort, a "threat to kidnap" a person, 18
U.S.C. § 875(b), and a "threat to injure the person of another," *id.*
Given the inherent wrongfulness of kidnaping and assault, the
parallelism of subsection (b)'s prohibitions with § 875(d)'s prohibition
against threats to injure reputation or property may support an
inference that Congress considered threats to injure reputation to be
inherently wrongful methods of obtaining money. Such an inference would
be consistent with the established principle that, when a threat is made
to injure the reputation of another, the truth of the damaging
allegations underlying the threat is not a defense to a charge of
extortion under § 875(d). **\[ ... \]***cf. United States v. Pascucci,*
943 F.2d 1032, 1033-34, 1036-37 (9th Cir.1991) (§ 875(d) conviction
upheld where defendant threatened to send genuine tape of extramarital
sexual encounter to victim's employer)**\[ ... \]**

*\[Still,\] we* are troubled that § 875(d) should be interpreted to
contain no element of wrongfulness, for plainly not all threats to
engage in speech that will have the effect of damaging another person's
reputation, even if a forbearance from speaking is conditioned on the
payment of money, are wrongful. For example, the purchaser of an
allegedly defective product may threaten to complain to a consumer
protection agency or to bring suit in a public forum if the manufacturer
does not make good on its warranty. Or she may threaten to enlist the
aid of a television "on-the-side-of-the-consumer" program. Or a private
club may threaten to post a list of the club members who have not yet
paid their dues. We doubt that Congress intended § 875(d) to criminalize
acts such as these**\[ ... \]**

The Hobbs Act prohibits, *inter alia,* obstructing, delaying, or
affecting commerce "by robbery or extortion," *id.* § 1951(a), and it
defines extortion as follows:

> The term "extortion" means the obtaining of property from another,
> with his consent, induced by *wrongful* use of actual or threatened
> force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,

*id.* § 1951(b)(2) **\[ ... \]** The Travel Act refers to "extortion"
without defining it. That Act has nonetheless been interpreted as using
the term in its "generic" sense, a sense that inherently signifies
wrongfulness. Thus, in determining whether the term "extortion" as used
in § 1952 was meant to encompass acts that at common law were classified
as blackmail but not as extortion (because not committed by a public
official), the Supreme Court accepted the

> Government\'s\]**\[ ... \]** suggestion\] that Congress intended that
> extortion should refer to those acts prohibited by state law which
> would be *generically* classified as extortionate, i.e., obtaining
> something of value from another with his consent induced by the
> *wrongful* use of force, fear, or threats.

*United States v. Nardello,* 393 U.S. 286, 290**\[ ... \]**(1969) **\[
... \]**

In sum, in sections of the Criminal Code other than § 875(d), the words
"extort," "extortionate," and "extortion" either are defined to have a
wrongfulness component or implicitly contain such a component. If
Congress had meant the word "extort" in § 875(d) to have a different
connotation, we doubt that it would have chosen to convey that intention
by means of silence. **\[ ... \]**

Under the Hobbs Act definition of extortion, which includes obtaining
property from another through a wrongful threat of force or fear, the
use of a threat can be wrongful because it causes the victim to fear a
harm that is itself wrongful, such as physical injury, or because the
means is wrongful, such as violence. **\[ ... \]**However, the Hobbs Act
may also be violated by a threat that causes the victim to fear only an
economic loss. **\[ ... \]**Yet as we discussed in *United States v.
Clemente,* 640 F.2d 1069, 1077 (2d Cir.), **\[ ... \]** a threat to
cause economic loss is not inherently wrongful; it becomes wrongful only
when it is used to obtain property to which the threatener is not
entitled.

In *Clemente,* we considered challenges to Hobbs Act convictions on the
ground that the trial court's instructions permitted the jury to
"convict\[ Clemente\] solely upon finding that he used fear of economic
loss to obtain money," and that as a matter of law "the use of fear of
economic loss is not inherently wrongful." 640 F.2d at 1077. We rejected
the challenge because Clem-ente's factual premise was erroneous. The
trial court had in fact informed the jury, *inter alia,* that
"extortion" means obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by the "wrongful" use of actual or threatened force or fear,
*id.* at 1076 (internal quotation marks omitted), and had instructed
that "\[wjrongful" meant that the defendant in question had instilled in
his victim the fear of economic loss of property to which the defendant
"had no lawful right," *id. at* 1077 **\[ ... \]**

We are persuaded that a similar interpretation of § 875(d) is
appropriate. Given Congress's contemporaneous consideration of the
predecessors of § 875(d) and the Hobbs Act, both of which focused on
extortion, we infer that Congress's concept of *extortion* was the same
with respect to both statutes. **\[ ... \]**And since, like threats of
economic harm, not every threat to make a disclosure that would harm
another person's reputation is wrongful, we adopt an interpretation of §
875(d) similar to Clemente's interpretation of the Hobbs Act. We
conclude that not all threats to reputation are within the scope of §
875(d), that the objective of the party employing fear *of* economic
loss or damage to reputation will have a bearing on the lawfulness of
its use, and that it is material whether the defendant had a claim of
right to the money demanded.

We do, however, view as inherently wrongful the type of threat to
reputation that has no nexus to a claim of right. There are significant
differences between, on the one hand, threatened disclosures of such
matters as consumer complaints and nonpayment of dues, as to which the
threatener has a plausible claim of right, and, on the other hand,
threatened disclosures of such matters as sexual indiscretions that have
no nexus with any plausible claim of right. In the former category of
threats, the disclosures themselves---not only the threats---have the
potential for causing payment of the money demanded; in the latter
category, it is only the threat that has that potential, and actual
disclosure would frustrate the prospect of payment. Thus, if the club
posts a list of members with unpaid dues and its list is accurate, the
dues generally will be paid; if the consumer lodges her complaint and is
right, she is likely to receive her refund; and both matters are thereby
concluded. In contrast, if a threatener having no claim of right
discloses the victim's secret, regardless of whether her information is
correct she normally gets nothing from the target of her threats. And if
the victim makes the demanded payment, thereby avoiding disclosure,
there is nothing to prevent the threatener from repeatedly demanding
money even after prior demands have been fully met**\[ ... \]**

Within this framework, we conclude that the district court's instruction
to the jury on the meaning of "extort" as that term is used in § 875(d)
was erroneous. The court instructed simply that "to extort means to
obtain money or a thing of value from another by use of threats to
reputation." The court gave no other explanation of the term "extort"
and did not limit the scope of that term to the obtaining of property to
which the defendant had no actual, or reasonable belief of, entitlement.
**\[ ... \]**

The evidence at trial was plainly sufficient to support verdicts of
guilty had the jury been properly instructed. Even if Jackson were
Cosby's child, a rational jury could find that her demand, given her age
(22) and the amount (\$40 million), did not reflect a plausible claim
for support. The evidence supported an inference that Jackson had no
right to demand money from Cosby pursuant to a contract or promise and
no right to insist that she be included in his will. The jury thus could
have found that her threat to disclose was the only leverage she had to
extract money from him; that if she sold her story to *The Globe,* she
would lose that leverage; and that if Cosby had capitulated and paid her
in order to prevent disclosure, there was no logical guarantee that
there would not be a similar threat and demand in the future. **\[ ...
\]**

We conclude, however, that the court's failure to inform the jury of the
proper scope of the intent-to-extort element of § 875(d) erroneously
allowed the jury to find defendants guilty of violating that section on
the premise that any and every threat to reputation in order to obtain
money is inherently wrongful. Accordingly, Jackson and Medina are
entitled to a new trial on the § 875(d) count**\[ ... \]**

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

The key federal statute used in robbery and extortion prosecutions is
[18 U.S.C. § 1951](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1951),
which reads:

\(a\) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects
commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by
robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or
threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of
a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or
both.\
(b) As used in this section---\
(1) The term "**robbery**" means the unlawful taking or obtaining of
personal property from the person or in the presence of another, against
his will, by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear
of injury, immediate or future, to his person or property, or property
in his custody or possession, or the person or property of a relative or
member of his family or of anyone in his company at the time of the
taking or obtaining.\
(2) The term "**extortion**" means the obtaining of property from
another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or
threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.

Under this statute, what is the difference between \"robbery\" and
\"extortion\"? What makes *Zhou* a case of extortion rather than
robbery? Is there a difference between the two offenses in whether
victim has some degree of choice? Or is confronted with a different
kind, or degree, or coercion? Alternately, consider whether the two
offenses be distinguished by focusing on *timing.* Does it matter if the
defendant\'s threat to the victim occurs immediately prior to the
defendant obtaining the victim\'s property (e.g., \"give me your money
or I\'ll shoot you with this gun\"), versus the defendant making the
threat sometime before he confronts the victim to obtain the property
(e.g., \"give me your money when I come to your house tonight, or I\'ll
shoot you\")? Does anything in the statute suggest that such timing
differences matter?

Given all that we have learned about Bill Cosby since this case was
decided, Autumn Jackson\'s claim that Cosby is her father perhaps seems
more plausible than it did to prosecutors, network executives, and
others at the time. If she is, what makes her claim wrongful? It is
clearly legal for her to sell her story to the tabloids for whatever
they will pay. And even without much knowledge of the relevant civil
law, surely children are entitled to some level financial support from
biological fathers. Did she just ask for too much? Did linking the
request to the tabloid-publicity deal make the request wrongful? Why so?

A08A0197

2008-06-25

(663 SE2d 832)

Miller, Judge.

Following a bench trial, Lavashiae Kier was convicted of a single count
of possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, in violation of OCGA
§ 16-13-2. She now appeals, claiming that the evidence was insufficient
to sustain her conviction. Kier also asserts that the trial court's
denial of her motion for a continuance and her motion to produce an
incarcerated witness violated her Sixth Amendment rights to the
effective assistance of counsel and compulsory process, respectively.
Finding that the State failed to prove Kier's possession of marijuana
beyond a reasonable doubt, we reverse.

"On appeal from a criminal conviction, the evidence must be viewed in
the light most favorable to support the verdict, and \[the defendant\]
no longer enjoys a presumption of innocence." (Citations and punctuation
omitted.) *Jackson v. State, 252* Ga. App. 268 (1) (555 SE2d 908)
(2001). So viewed, the evidence shows that on January 20, 2007, Sergeant
Zack Tanner of the Baldwin County Sheriffs Department observed a vehicle
traveling at a very low rate of speed while flashing its emergency
lights. Tanner conducted a traffic stop to see if the driver needed
assistance, and he found that the car was owned and driven by Cory
Dixon. A juvenile was sitting in the front passenger seat next to Dixon;
Kier was seated in the rear seat behind Dixon; and Kier's friend,
Chiquita Baker, was seated next to Kier in the back seat.

After Tanner approached the driver's side door, Dixon rolled down his
window, and Tanner noticed both the scent of marijuana coming from the
vehicle and smoke inside of it. In investigating the possible presence
of marijuana in the car, Tanner found a bag containing 16 "rocks" of
crack cocaine in the compartment of the driver's door. Tanner then
arrested Dixon, and he asked the other occupants of the car to exit the
same. After the passengers were outside the car, police observed a
hand-rolled marijuana cigarette on the rear floorboard, just behind the
center console, and observed that the same had been recently smoked.
Based on this cigarette, Tanner arrested all three passengers for
possession of marijuana.

The only defense witness was Baker, who stated that on the evening in
question, she and Kier had gone to a local nightclub, where she
encountered Dixon, whom she knew from school. Baker asked Dixon if he
could give Kier and her a ride home, and Dixon agreed. During that ride,
Dixon and his juvenile passenger smoked a marijuana cigarette, which
they disposed of when the police stopped the car. Baker, however, did
not see what they did with that cigarette, because she was preoccupied
with hiding her personal marijuana, obtained at the nightclub, in her
underwear. Baker further stated that Kier did not smoke the marijuana
cigarette belonging to Dixon and his juvenile passenger, that Kier was
unaware that Baker had marijuana on her person, and that she never saw
Kier in possession of marijuana that night.

After the trial court found Kier guilty, she filed this appeal.

1\. Kier first asserts that the evidence was insufficient to sustain her
conviction. We agree.

Because no evidence showed Kier in actual possession of the marijuana,
the State relied on circumstantial evidence to show she had constructive
possession of the same. To prove constructive possession, the State was
required to show some connection between Kier and the marijuana
cigarette other than spatial proximity. "Evidence of mere presence at
the scene of the crime, and nothing more to show participation of a
defendant in the illegal act, is insufficient to support a conviction."
(Citation and punctuation omitted.) *Hodges v. State,* 277 Ga. App. 174
(626 SE2d 133) (2006). Rather, the State needed to demonstrate beyond a
reasonable doubt that Kier "knowingly had both the power and intention
at a given time to exercise control over the \[marijuana\]. Power may be
inferred from access to the drugs, while the matter of intent may be
derived from the surrounding circumstances." (Citations and punctuation
omitted.) *Castillo v. State,* 288 Ga. App. 828, 830 (655 SE2d 695)
(2007).

Circumstances showing an intent to exercise control over the drugs
include a defendant's attempts to flee or elude police; inconsistent
explanations by the defendant for her behavior; the presence of
significant amounts of contraband and drug paraphernalia in plain view;
the defendant's possession of large amounts of cash, other indicia of
the sale of drugs, or drug-related paraphernalia; evidence that the
defendant was under the influence of drugs; or drug residue found on the
defendant. See, e.g., *Hodges,* supra, 277 Ga. App. at 175-176; *Moody
v. State,* 232 Ga. App. 499, 501 (1) (502 SE2d 323) (1998); *Francis v.
State,* 231 Ga. App. 112, 113 (1) (497 SE2d 827) (1998). The evidence
shows no such circumstances in this case. Specifically, there was no
evidence that Kier was uncooperative, attempted to flee police, behaved
erratically, or appeared to be under the influence of drugs. Sergeant
Tanner testified that the evidence indicated that the juvenile sitting
in the front passenger seat had rolled the marijuana cigarette. Sergeant
Tanner further admitted that while marijuana residue was found on the
floor and on the front passenger seat, no such residue was found in the
area near Kier, on her seat, or on her person, and that Kier possessed
no drug paraphernalia.

Furthermore,

> when the State's constructive possession case is based wholly on
> circumstantial evidence, the law requires that the proved facts shall
> not only be consistent with the hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude
> every other reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the
> accused.

(Citation and punctuation omitted.) *Hodges,* supra, 277 Ga. App. at
174. "When the circumstantial evidence supports more than one theory,
one consistent with guilt and another with innocence, it does not
exclude every other reasonable hypothesis except guilt and is not
sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
(Citations and punctuation omitted.) *Paden v. State,* 216 Ga. App. 188,
189 (453 SE2d 788) (1995).

The circumstantial evidence presented at trial was entirely consistent
with Kier's theory of innocence --- i.e, that she was merely a passenger
in Dixon's car and had nothing to do with the marijuana cigarette found
therein. Accordingly, we find no evidentiary basis on which the trial
court could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kier was in constructive
possession of that marijuana. See *Autry v. State,* 150 Ga. App. 584
(258 SE2d 268) (1979) (reversing conviction of possession of less than
one ounce of marijuana where no evidence connected marijuana, which was
in car's ashtray, to the defendant-passenger); *Mitchell v. State,* 268
Ga. 592, 593 (492 SE2d 204) (1997) (noting there is no presumption of
possession by a mere passenger in an automobile, even where the drugs
are found near that passenger). Nor was this evidence sufficient to
convict Kier as a party to the crime of possession. See *Edwards v.
State,* 272 Ga. App. 540, 543 (1) (612 SE2d 868) (2005).

*Kristen C. Quinton,* for appellant.

*Maxine Blackwell, Solicitor-General,* for appellee.

2\. In light of our holding in Division 1, we need not address Kier's
remaining enumerations of error.

For the reasons set forth above, we find that the evidence was
insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Kier
was in constructive possession of the marijuana, and we therefore
reverse her conviction for the same.

KANNE, Circuit Judge.

Defendant Cheryl A. Hunte appeals her conviction and sentence for her
role in an attempt to transport narcotics from Arizona to New York in
1997. The trial court sentenced Hunte to concurrent terms of
thirty-three months imprisonment, two years supervised release and a
\$500 fine. On appeal, Hunte challenged the sufficiency of the evidence
against her and the denial of a sentencing reduction under U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines Manual § SB 1.2 for her minimal or minor role in
the crime. We find the trial court erred in denying the § 3B1.2
reduction and remand the case to the trial court for re-sentencing.
Recognizing that Hunte is due to be released in February 2000, we have
expedited review of her appeal.

I. HISTORY

*A. The Conspiracy*

In March 1997, Hunte decided to accompany her boyfriend, now
co-defendant, Joseph Richards, on a trip to California with an
acquaintance known as Luis Gonzalez. Richards was a known drug dealer,
and there was little mystery that the purpose of the trip was to
purchase and bring back a load of narcotics. Richards supplied a minivan
for the trip, and Gonzalez was to be the driver. Richards agreed to pay
Gonzalez seven pounds of marijuana for help driving the van, purportedly
to California. Hunte, on the other hand, stood to gain nothing from the
deal. She apparently went along for the ride.

Richards directed the trip and made all or most of the decisions. Once
on the road, he told Gonzalez that they were headed for Arizona, not
California, and that he planned to pick up as much marijuana as he could
get and bring it back to New York. Gonzalez would get his share and sell
it for \$8,000 to \$9,000. Richards warned Gonzalez to drive safely and
obey the speed limit and other rules of the road.

The three drove until they got to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they rented a
motel room. They showered but did not stay the night. Instead, leaving
Hunte behind, Richards and Gonzalez went to meet Johnathan Warwick.
Warwick was a Tulsa resident who rented a room from a man to whom
Richards owed \$3,000 for past drug dealings. Richards asked Warwick to
help him drive to Phoenix (apparently not telling him for what purpose).
Warwick agreed, believing that if the trip was successful, Richards
would pay his friend the \$3,000 Richards owed, and the friend would
stop taking Warwick's disability checks for room and board. The three
men picked up Hunte at the motel and left for Arizona.

Once back on the highway, Richards changed the plan again and said they
were headed for Tucson, not Phoenix, and that their ultimate destination
was Virginia, not New York. Warwick eventually figured out they were
going to pick up drugs, but by this time they were in Texas. In Tucson,
Richards made some calls from a pay phone at a convenience store, and
eventually a man in a Chevy Blazer arrived who then escorted them to a
house. Several hours later, .a man came and took the minivan, returning
it later loaded with marijuana. Richards asked Gonzalez and Warwick to
help him carry the marijuana into the kitchen. During this time, Hunte
remained in the living room watching television. With Hunte in the other
room, the three men weighed the bundles of marijuana. Richards cut one
bundle open to make sure it was all marijuana and extracted some buds
for sampling. Gonzalez testified at trial that Richards took precautions
to keep Hunte out of the business aspects of the deal.

Hunte helped roll the buds into a joint and closed the window blinds
while the group smoked the marijuana. Warwick, Richards and Gonzalez
re-wrapped the marijuana and loaded it into the van. Richards' brother
then arrived in a burgundy Nissan Maxima. After dropping off Richards'
brother in Phoenix, Richards and Hunte drove to Tulsa in the Maxima,
followed by Gonzalez and Warwick in the van. Hunte registered for a
motel room for herself and Richards, while Gonzalez and Warwick
registered for another room. Richards paid all expenses, including the
motels, throughout the trip.

The next morning, March 25, 1997, the group awoke and continued to New
York. In Illinois, state police pulled the minivan over and a search
revealed the bundles of marijuana. Warwick and Gonzalez admitted they
were following another car, and based on the information they supplied,
the police radioed ahead and were able to pull over Hunte and Richards.
Before they were stopped by police but after the minivan had been pulled
over, Hunte and Richards had switched positions so that Hunte was
driving. Hunte and Richards initially denied that they were traveling
with the minivan and told police they had been traveling around the
Midwest looking for farm equipment for Richards' Jamaican chicken farm.
As their grasp of basic geography deteriorated, so did their cover
story. Police matched fingerprints on the marijuana to Richards, but not
to Hunte.

*B. The Trial and Sentence*

Richards, Warwick and Gonzalez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and
possession with intent to distribute almost 45 kilograms of marijuana.
Hunte, like the others, was charged with conspiracy to possess with
intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; and
possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. §
841(a)(1). Gonzalez and Warwick agreed to testify against Hunte at trial
in exchange for one-third off their sentences. At trial, Hunte's primary
defense was that she never possessed the marijuana because Richards was
in charge and only he, Gonzalez and Warwick ever handled the bundles.
Further, she contended that she was not a part of the conspiracy because
she did not stand to gain from it.

The jury had difficulty with the concept of possession and sent a
question to the judge asking for a clarification of the legal definition
of constructive possession. Judge Stiehl referred the jury to the jury
instructions, but otherwise provided no additional help. The jury found
Hunte guilty on both counts.

At sentencing, Judge Stiehl denied Hunte reductions for acceptance of
responsibility or for her minor or minimal role in the crimes. The court
found that Richards was the leader of the group but that Hunte "actively
participated" by driving the vehicle, making hotel reservations and
providing cover for Richards. The court stated that it found nothing to
justify either a minor or minimal role on Hunte's part. Hunte had no
prior juvenile or adult criminal history and, therefore, qualified for a
criminal history category of I. The total offense level for two counts
was 20, which translated to a Guidelines range of thirty-three to
forty-one months. Finding no aggravating circumstances, Judge Stiehl
sentenced Hunte on October 8, 1997, to the bottom of that range.

II\. Analysis

On appeal, Hunte raises two challenges. First, she contends that her
involvement in the crimes was too insubstantial to support either the
conspiracy or the possession charges. Secondly, she challenges the trial
court's denial of a reduction under § 3B1.2, which permits a two- or
four-level reduction (potentially up to twelve months in Hunte's case)
if the defendant played only a minor or minimal role in the offense.

In reviewing a jury's determination for sufficiency of the evidence, the
court must view the evidence in the "light most favorable to the
prosecution." *Jackson v. Virginia,* 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781,
61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); *United States v. Boykins,* 9 F.3d 1278, 1282
(7th Cir.1993). The court then asks whether *"any* rational trier of
fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a
reasonable doubt." *Id.* The denial of a downward departure under §
3B1.2 "will be affirmed if it results from a proper application of the
sentencing guidelines to facts not found to be clearly erroneous."
*United States v. Herrera,* 878 F.2d 997, 1000 (7th Cir.1989); *see also
United States v. Hagan,* 913 F.2d 1278, 1283 (7th Cir.1990).

A. *Sufficiency of the Evidence*

*1. Conspiracy*

Conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846 requires that the Government establish
the existence of an agreement between two or more persons "for the
purpose of committing, by their joint efforts, a criminal act." *United
States v. Campbell,* 985 F.2d 341, 344 (7th Cir.1993). The Government
must show a "participatory link" between the conspiracy and the
defendant. *United States v. Navarez,* 954 F.2d 1375, 1380-81 (7th
Cir.1992). That link must be established by sufficient evidence
demonstrating that the defendant knew of the conspiracy and intended to
join its criminal purpose. *Id.* However, unlike liability for attempt,
conspiracy liability does not require evidence of an overt act by the
defendant, *see United States v. Shabani,* 513 U.S. 10, 15, 115 S.Ct.
382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994), *United States v. Pulido,* 69 F.3d 192,
208-09 (7th Cir.1995), and the phrase "participatory link" should not be
confused in that way. Rather, the link simply provides a way to show
that the defendant joined the conspiratorial agreement.

The evidence of Hunte's involvement in the conspiracy is slight. She
appeared to have no role in planning the trip or securing any of the
things necessary for its completion, such as the vehicles, cash or
cohorts. She seemed to have no express understanding with Richards as to
her involvement in the plan or share of the proceeds. She had no express
responsibilities, did not negotiate the drug transaction and apparently
was not needed to handle, weigh or transport the drugs.

However, the jury may consider "overt acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy as circumstantial evidence establishing knowing participation
in a conspiracy." *United States v. Burrell,* 963 F.2d 976, 988 (7th
Cir.1992). The evidence shows that Hunte knew of the conspiracy's
existence, as she spent several days traveling from New York to Arizona
where the group picked up a large load of marijuana, sampled it, hid it
in the minivan and returned toward New York. The question is whether she
intended to join its criminal purpose and the bare overt acts committed
in furtherance of the conspiracy establish that intent. For instance, a
jury could find a participatory link between Hunte and the conspiracy
from Hunte's closing the window blinds to hide their activities from
view, helping to roll a joint for sampling, registering for the hotel
room where the group rested, driving one of the vehicles used for
transportation of the co-conspirators, and lying to police about their
destination and about their association with Warwick and Gonzalez. The
fact that she did not expect to share directly in the proceeds of the
crime does not defeat a finding of knowing participation. A criminal
without a profit motive is still a criminal as long as all elements of
the crime are established.

*2. Possession*

Possession with intent to distribute marijuana requires the Government
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunte 1) knowingly or intentionally
possessed the marijuana, 2) possessed the marijuana with the intent to
distribute it and 3) knew the marijuana was a controlled substance. *See
United States v. Hunter,* 145 F.3d 946, 950 (7th Cir.1998). The first
element, possession, can be satisfied by direct or circumstantial
evidence of constructive or joint possession., *See United States v.
Tirrell,* 120 F.3d 670, 675-76 (7th Cir.1997); *United States v.
Kitchen,* 57 F.3d 516, 520-21 (7th Cir.1995). Constructive possession
applies when "a person does not have actual possession but instead
knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time to exercise
dominion and control over an object, either directly or through others."
*United States v. Garrett,* 903 F.2d 1105, 1110 (7th Cir.1990) (emphasis
omitted); *see also United States v. DiNovo,* 523 F.2d 197, 201 (7th
Cir.1975).

Hunte challenges her conviction on the theory that she did not exercise
"dominion and control" over the marijuana because at all times Richards,
as the group's leader, had exclusive control over the contraband.
*DiNovo* stands for the proposition that "mere proximity to the drug,
mere presence on the property where it is located, or mere association,
without more, with the person who does control the drug or the property
on which it is found, is insufficient .to support a finding of
possession." *DiNovo,* 523 F.2d at 199. This line of cases protects the
"ordinary bystander" who happens to be unlucky enough to be near someone
who possesses contraband. *United States v. Windom,* 19 F.3d 1190, 1200
(7th Cir.1994). To this end, we have required that in non-exclusive
possession cases, the evidence must show some nexus between the
defendant and the drugs. *See United States v. Hernandez,* 13 F.3d 248,
252 (7th Cir.1994); *United States v. Perry,* 747 F.2d 1165, 1171-72
(7th Cir.1984); *United States v. Galiffa,* 734 F.2d 306, 316 (7th
Cir.1984).

*Galiffa* appears especially instructive in this case. In *Galiffa,*
Stuart Ashenfelter and Thomas Galiffa rented a truck, Ashen-felter
bought some boxes and the two drove to a forest preserve. Ashenfelter
then proceeded alone to a hiding place where he retrieved the marijuana.
He picked up Galiffa in the forest preserve and the two returned to
their house. While Ashenfelter, Galiffa and another man were unloading
the contraband, they were arrested. Galiffa challenged the sufficiency
of the evidence on his conviction for possession. Galiffa argued that
his mere presence in the truck, presence at the rear of the truck during
unloading and flight from law enforcement officers were insufficient to
establish his possession of the marijuana or his knowledge of the
contents of the packages. This court held that "\[r\]esidence in a house
used as a drug distribution center, and evidence of direct access to and
participation in the marijuana distribution on the day of his arrest is
enough to establish this nexus and, therefore, marijuana possession
under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)." *Id.* at 315.

As convincing as the proof against Galif-fa, the evidence against Hunte
more than substantiates the nexus between her and the contraband. There
can be no doubt of her knowledge of the marijuana since she was present
when it was delivered, unloaded, sampled and loaded. Although the
evidence of her direct access to the drugs and participation in the
transportation is minimal, it can hardly be said that she was in any
sense an ordinary bystander. She registered for the hotel room, drove at
least one of the vehicles, helped hide their activities from view and
aided in the sampling of the drugs. She can no more claim to be a mere
bystander than could Thomas Galiffa.

Hunte points to our decision in *Kitchen* as support for the argument
that mere association or presence is insufficient to establish
constructive possession. In *Kitchen,* we dealt with two factual
scenarios that implicate constructive possession. First, we held that
proof of a defendant's access to a firearm, even when others also had
access, was sufficient to allow a jury to find constructive possession.
*Kitchen,* 57 F.3d at 521. In *Kitchen,* a firearm had been found in the
bedroom of a house where the defendant occasionally stayed overnight.
Evidence in that case, including the fact that the defendant resided at
the house and that the room contained other possessions belonging to the
defendant, established a nexus between the defendant and the firearm.
*Id.* The fact that other adults likewise had access to the house did
not negate a finding of constructive possession. *Id.* Here, the fact
that Richards and the other two defendants had access to and possession
of the marijuana did not defeat an inference that Hunte also possessed
the marijuana since she too had knowledge of and access to it.

Hunte understandably focuses on the second holding of *Kitchen* in which
we reversed a conviction for cocaine possession where the defendant had
picked up the contraband for no more than two or three seconds. *Id.* at
521-24. We held that on a theory of actual possession, a momentary
handling\'of the cocaine did not show automatically that the defendant
had control over the contraband. *Id.* In contrast to the prototypical
constructive possession case, which allows a conviction by showing a
defendant controlled the contraband even if she never physically touches
it, *Kitchen* says that a physical handling of contraband is not enough
if it fails to demonstrate control. Both theories of possession require
the defendant control the contraband to possess it, although that
control is obvious in most actual possession cases.

While *Kitchen* correctly states the doctrines of constructive and
actual possession, the analysis of that case does not help Hunte. Hunte
argues that no evidence shows "she ever touched the bundles of
marijuana," but that argument only refutes actual possession and is not
dispos-itive of constructive possession. Hunte further argues that only
Richards had constructive possession of the marijuana, as shown by his
offer to pay Gonzalez from-the stash and to let Hunte sample some of it.
While those facts provide strong evidence that Richards exercised
control over the drugs, it does not necessarily mean Hunte and the
others did not jointly possess them as well. As discussed above, control
need not be exclusive.

The evidence showed that all four defendants were engaged in a plan to
transport narcotics and that Richards was the leader of the group. The
fact that one person leads and the others follow does not mean that only
the leader has possession of the contraband. All four had access to the
drugs at various times and assisted in their concealment and
transportation. As a group, the four each exercised joint possession of
the narcotics by virtue of their individual acts consistent with
non-exclusive dominion and control over the contraband.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a
rational trier of fact could find Hunte guilty on both the conspiracy
and possession counts. Therefore, we will affirm her convictions.

*B. Sentencing Guidelines § 3B1.2*

We review a district court's refusal to give a downward adjustment based
on § 3B1.2 for clear error, remembering however that the defendant has
the burden of establishing his minor or minimal status in the crime by a
preponderance of the evidence. *See United States v. Cain,* 155 F.3d
840, 844 (7th Cir.1998); *United States v. Castillo,* 148 F.3d 770, 776
(7th Cir.1998). According to the Guidelines notes and our cases applying
this section, a minimal participant is one who is "plainly among the
least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group," § 3B1.2
application note 1; *see also Castillo,* 148 F.3d at 776. The departure
for minimal participants was intended to be used "infrequently." § 3B1.2
application note 2. A minor participant means "any participant who is
less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be
described as minimal." § 3B1.2 application note 3; *see also Castillo,*
148 F.3d at 776.

At the very least, we find that Hunte was a minor participant in that
she was less culpable than most other participants. Hunte may in fact
have been a minimal participant. The difference between minor and
minimal depends on how the sentencing judge views the guilty conduct of
the other participants. The former requires "less culpable than most"
while the latter asks for "plainly among the least culpable."

These are not precise terms, but the suggestions that accompany the
guidelines are helpful, as are comparisons to some of other cases
interpreting this section. A minimal participant is one who unloaded a
single shipment of marijuana in a large-scale smuggling operation, or
once acted as a courier in a small smuggling operation. Application Note
2. Both examples suggest a participant who played a role necessary to
the, accomplishment of the crime.

In *Castillo,* we affirmed the trial court's denial of a reduction for a
minor role because we found that each of the five charged defendants
"was an essential component in this drug conspiracy." 148 F.3d at 776.
For instance, one defendant provided a place for the smugglers to sleep,
while another re-wrapped the marijuana. *Id.* None were entitled to the
reduction. *Id.* Likewise, we affirmed the reduction denial in *Cain,*
where the defendant "provided necessary services to the conspiracy by
driving \[a co-defendant\], renting the car used to deliver drugs, and
renting the apartment used to store them." 155 F.3d at 844.

While "minor" is .not necessarily synonymous with "nonessential,"
Hunte's participation seems to fall well below the threshold established
by the comments and cases interpreting § 3B1.2. Hunte helped hide the
groups activities by closing the blinds, and registered for a motel
room, but she was in no sense a courier nor did she help load or unload
the drugs. She provided nothing "necessary" or "essential" to the
operation.

Hunte unquestionably is less culpable than Gonzalez and Richards, who
both stood to profit from the deal. Richards was the ring leader
responsible for the entire operation, including arranging to meet the
supplier and finishing the deal. Gonzalez came along only because he
expected to participate in the deal as a vital player, a role that could
be described loosely as a partner. Further, he carried the bundles of
marijuana, helped with its packaging and helped drive the minivan.

The Government correctly points out that there were other participants,
specifically the unnamed contacts and dealers in Arizona, but Hunte
appeared less culpable than even these players. Although financial gain
should not be the only, or even the dominant, factor in determining
culpability under § 3B1.2, the Arizona contacts held much more critical
and culpable positions in the deal. They were the suppliers who formed
an integral link in the chain of drug trafficking that extends from
growers to street dealers. Without them, there was no deal.

Only Warwick may have been less culpable than Hunte, but even he
expected some financial reward\'---Richards' debt paid to Warwick's
landlord-----and he helped carry the bundles into the house and tended
to the packaging and testing. By definition, Hunte appears to be "among
the least culpable" even if Warwick and she were equally culpable.

Clear error exists when, after reviewing the evidence, the court is
"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
committed." *Herrera,* 878 F.2d at 1000. This is such a case. The
evidence establishing Hunte's conviction, while sufficient, fails to
show her participating in anything other than a minor or minimal way.
The offense definitions under §§ 841 and 846 do not ask or care whether
a defendant's participation was minor or major, but the Sentencing
Guidelines do. Here, we find the evidence indicates Hunte's role
qualified her for at least a two-level reduction as a minor participant,
although we leave it to the sound discretion of the trial court to
determine whether she qualifies for a four-level reduction.

III\. Conolusion

We find that the evidence supports the defendant's conviction for
conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute narcotics and Affirm
her convictions. Because the sentencing court erred in rejecting a §
3B1.2 reduction, we Remanb the case to the district court for prompt
re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.

 

 

 

Garcia v. State

 

901 So. 2d 788 (Fla. 2005)

QUINCE, J.

We have for review the decision in *Garcia v. State*, 854 So. 2d 758
(Fla. 2d DCA 2003), which certified conflict with the decision in
*Goodman v. State*, 839 So. 2d 902 (Fla. 1st DCA 2003). We have
jurisdiction. *See* art. V, § 3(b)(4), Fla. Const. For the reasons more
fully expressed below, we quash the decision of the Second District
Court of Appeal, and approve *Goodman*.

*Facts*

The facts of this case are thoroughly set forth in the Second District's
decision as follows:

In the early morning hours on June 9, 2001, Pasco County Deputy Sheriff
Joseph Irizarry observed Garcia driving a truck. Garcia's vehicle first
came to Deputy Irizarry's attention when it passed through a flashing
yellow light without slowing down. Thereafter, Deputy Irizarry saw
Garcia's vehicle go off the road while making a right-hand turn and then
weave off the roadway onto the grassy shoulder three times. After
observing this behavior and following Garcia's vehicle for approximately
a quarter of a mile, Deputy Irizarry decided to stop Garcia's vehicle.

After the vehicle stopped and Deputy Irizarry approached the driver's
window of the vehicle, he smelled alcohol and observed that Garcia's
eyes were bloodshot and that Garcia's speech was slurred. Garcia was
alone in the truck. Deputy Irizarry proceeded to conduct field sobriety
tests. After conducting the tests, Deputy Irizarry arrested Garcia for
driving under the influence.

In the meantime, Deputy Wilkins and Deputy Banner arrived at the scene.
In the course of searching Garcia's truck incident to his arrest, Deputy
Wilkins found an item\--which looked like a softball wrapped in black
electrical tape\--underneath the passenger's seat of Garcia's truck.
Garcia told the deputies at the scene that he did not know what the item
was, that he had not seen it before, and had not known that it was in
the truck. He also stated that his truck had recently been stolen and
that some friends had been in his truck earlier that night. Subsequent
tests conducted by the FDLE crime laboratory determined that an
off-white powder contained within the item was a mixture containing
methamphetamine and a cutting agent.

Garcia was charged by information with trafficking in methamphetamine,
driving under the influence, and obstructing or resisting an officer
without violence. In his testimony at trial, Garcia stated that the
night of his arrest he had the truck at a party from about 7:00 p.m.
until 2:00 a.m. His truck was used at the party for playing CDs. Garcia
also used the truck on two occasions during the party to take friends to
buy beer. Garcia denied using drugs. He testified that he did not put
the tape-covered item in the truck, know it was there, or know what it
contained. Finally, Garcia testified that his truck had been stolen on
Wednesday, May 31, from a shop where he had taken it. The truck was
recovered the following Monday in a dirty condition and containing items
that did not belong to Garcia. After recovering the truck, he returned
it to the shop for the installation of a stereo. When he later picked up
the truck, it was clean.

Garcia was found guilty of the driving under the influence charge and
guilty of the lesser-included crime of possession of methamphetamine on
the trafficking offense. He was found not guilty of the obstructing or
resisting charge.

During the trial, at the close of the State's evidence and at the close
of all the evidence, Garcia moved for a judgment of acquittal on the
trafficking charge pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure
3.380(a). The motion was denied.

*Id.* at 760-61. At the jury charge conference, Garcia objected to the
standard jury instruction that permitted the jury to infer or assume
knowledge of the presence of the methamphetamine based on exclusive
possession. The trial court overruled the objection, rejected Garcia's
proposed special instructions, and read the standard instructions on
trafficking. In listing the elements of trafficking, the trial court
instructed the jury that "the defendant's knowledge 'that the substance
was methamphetamine or a mixture containing methamphetamine' was a
material element of the offense of *trafficking*." *Id.* at 764
(emphasis added). The trial court also instructed the jury concerning
actual and constructive possession and stated as follows:

If a thing is in a place over which the person does not have control, in
order to establish constructive possession, the State must prove the
person has control over the thing, knowledge of the thing which was in
the person's presence, and the *knowledge of the illicit nature of the
thing*.

*Id.* at 765 (alteration in original). The trial court then gave an
instruction on the elements of the lesser included offense of simple
possession. That instruction omitted any reference to the requirement
that the defendant have knowledge of the illicit nature of the
substance. However, the trial court did state that the prior instruction
regarding the "definition of possession . . . applies to the lesser
charge as it did to the greater charge." *Id.* at 765. Garcia did not
object to the failure to include the element of "knowledge of the
*illicit nature* of the substance" in the jury instruction on the lesser
included offense of possession.

During deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the court: "What
is the difference between trafficking and possession of
methamphetamine?" The court then reread the instructions on possession
and trafficking, but not the instructions concerning actual and
constructive possession. The jury acquitted Garcia of trafficking but
found him guilty of the lesser included offense of possession. Garcia
renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal and moved for a new trial.
Both motions were denied.

Garcia raised several claims on appeal. The district court summarily
denied all but the following two claims: (1) the trial court erred when
it denied Garcia's motion for judgment of acquittal based on his
contention that there was insufficient evidence to establish knowledge
of the illicit nature of the substance, and (2) the trial court erred in
giving a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of possession
that did not include the "knowledge of the illicit nature of the
substance" element, i.e., the "guilty knowledge element."

The district court held that the illicit nature of the substance is an
indisputable element of the crime of drug possession pursuant to
*Chicone v. State*, 684 So. 2d 736, 737 (Fla. 1996) (holding that guilty
knowledge is an element of possession of a controlled substance and
possession of drug paraphernalia). The district court rejected the
State's argument that the holding in *Chicone* was superseded by section
893.101, Florida Statutes (2002). That statute provides that knowledge
of the illicit nature of a controlled substance is not an element of
drug offenses, but lack of knowledge is an affirmative defense. The
statute became law after Garcia committed the offense in this case. The
district court then concluded that the instruction given was clearly
inadequate and erroneous. However, the court also found that Garcia did
not request an instruction concerning guilty knowledge with regard to
the possession offense, nor did he object to the trial court's failure
to give such an instruction. The error was not preserved, and the
district court found that it was not fundamental....\
*Law and Analysis*

In 1973, this Court established a presumption of the scienter element of
drug charges arising from actual possession. *See State v. Medlin*, 273
So. 2d 394 (Fla. 1973). In *Medlin*, the defendant gave a capsule to
another person, and it contained an illegal substance. Despite the fact
that Medlin told the other person that the capsule would make her "go
up," Medlin argued that there was no proof at trial to show that he
delivered the capsule with knowledge that it contained a barbiturate.
Medlin was convicted of delivery of an unlawful barbiturate. The
district court reversed the conviction finding that there was no proof
adduced to show that Medlin delivered the capsule with knowledge that it
contained a barbiturate or barbiturate derivative. On review, this Court
quashed the district court's decision and held that the State was not
required to prove knowledge or intent since both were presumed from the
doing of the prohibited act. The standard jury instructions for the
crime of possession\--the relevant crime in this case\--were then
adopted. In the instruction, knowledge of the presence of the substance
was listed as an element, and the *Medlin* presumption was incorporated
into that instruction by the following language: "If a person has
exclusive possession of a thing, knowledge of its presence may be
inferred or assumed." However, the instruction did not list knowledge of
the illicit nature of the substance as an element. An accompanying note
to the instruction stated that "if the defense seeks to show a lack of
knowledge as to the nature of a particular drug, an additional
instruction may be required." Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) Drug Abuse
(1981).

In 1987, this Court addressed whether the jury instructions on
trafficking offenses were erroneous because they did not include
knowledge of the nature of the substance as an element. *See State v.
Dominguez*, 509 So. 2d 917 (Fla. 1987). The Court found, under the
relevant statutes at the time, that *mens rea* was an element of all
trafficking charges. The Court then expressly amended the jury
instructions on trafficking offenses to include a fourth element: that
the defendant "knew the substance was (specific substance alleged)."
*Id.* at 918.

In 1996, the Court applied the rationale of *Dominguez* to possession
offenses. *See Chicone v. State*, 684 So. 2d 736 (Fla. 1996). In
*Chicone*, the defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine. The
trial court refused Chicone's request to instruct the jury that the
State had to prove he knew the substance he possessed was cocaine. On
review, this Court held that guilty knowledge is part of the statutory
offense charged. *Id.* at 738. The Court rejected the argument that
*Medlin* stood for the proposition that guilty knowledge is not an
element of possession and held that the relevant statutes expressly
required that the defendant knowingly possess a controlled substance. In
*Chicone*, the State was required to prove the defendant knew of the
*illicit nature* of the items in his or her possession, and the existing
jury instructions had to adequately state the "knowledge of the
*presence* of the substance" element *Id.* at 745 (emphasis added).
However, the trial court was only required to "expressly indicate to
jurors that guilty knowledge means the defendant must have knowledge of
the illicit nature of the substance allegedly possessed" if
"specifically requested by a defendant." *Id.* at 745-46.

*Chicone* did not address whether an error in failing to give such a
requested instruction is reviewable under a harmless error analysis or
whether it is fundamental error. That issue was addressed in *Scott v.
State*, 808 So. 2d 166 (Fla. 2002). In *Scott*, the defendant was
convicted of possession of contraband (cannabis) in a correctional
facility. At trial, Scott's defense was that he did not possess the
contraband and had no knowledge of its presence in his locker, where it
was found. He requested an instruction pursuant to *Chicone* that the
guilty knowledge element includes knowledge of the illicit nature of the
substance. The trial court denied the request. On review, this Court
held that the trial court's failure to give the requested instruction
was reversible error. This Court explained that the *Chicone* decision
stood for the proposition that both knowledge of the presence of the
substance and knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance are
essential elements of the crime of possession of an illegal substance.
*Id.* at 169. The Court then found that the standard jury instructions
on possession were inadequate as they did not inform the jury of the
illicit nature of the substance requirement of the guilty knowledge
element. *Id.* at 170. This Court further found that it is error to fail
to give the requested instruction even if the defendant did not
explicitly say he did not have knowledge of the illicit nature of the
substance. *Id.* at 172.

The defendant in *Scott* was not in actual, personal possession of the
drugs, and the testimony indicated that his locker may have been
accessible to other people, which raised the question of whether
exclusive constructive possession was proved. Thus in *Scott*, the Court
found reversible error and requested the Committee on Standard Jury
Instructions in Criminal Cases to propose an amendment to the jury
instructions for possession offenses that would include knowledge of the
illicit nature of the substance as an element. *Id.* at 172 n.7.

When read together, *Medlin*, *Chicone*, and *Scott* stand for the
proposition that "guilty knowledge" is an element of the offense of
possession and must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The guilty
knowledge element includes knowledge of both the *presence* of, and the
*illicit nature* of, the substance possessed, and the jury should be
instructed on both....

In this case, the element of knowledge of the illicit nature is in
dispute. A challenge to that element is encompassed in Garcia's argument
that he did not know the container existed at all and he had never seen
it before. By arguing that he did not have knowledge that the black
taped package existed, the defendant in this case is implicitly arguing
that he did not have knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance
inside of it. *See, e.g.*, *Scott*, 808 So. 2d at 169 (holding that
Scott's argument that he did not possess the drugs and had no knowledge
of the drug's presence in his locker encompasses the argument that he
was unaware of the illicit nature of the substance). We find that the
knowledge element of a possession charge includes both knowledge of
possession and knowledge of the nature of the illegal substance. Thus,
when a defendant argues that he or she had no knowledge that an illegal
substance was in his or her possession, that defendant also disputes
that he or she had knowledge of the nature of the illegal substance.
When an essential element of a crime is in dispute at trial, such as the
knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance in a possession case,
the failure to instruct the jury on that element is fundamental error.

Therefore, we approve the First District's decision in *Goodman* and
quash the Second District's decision in this case. It is so ordered.

WELLS, J., dissenting \[joined by CANTERO and BELL, JJ.\] \[Omitted\].

1 After the *Scott* decision was issued in January 2002, the Legislature
enacted section 893.101, Florida Statutes (2002), which sets forth
legislative intent that knowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled
substance is not an element of any offense under chapter 893 but rather
lack of knowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance is an
affirmative defense to the offenses of the chapter. Id. Furthermore, the
statute provides that when an affirmative defense under this statute is
raised, there is a presumption that the possessor knew of the illicit
nature of the substance. Id. This case was tried on December 11, 2001.
Thus, this statute was enacted after the offense and trial in this case.

 

 

 

State v. Pigford

 

Supreme Court of Louisiana

922 So. 2d 517 (2006)

 

PER CURIAM:

Defendant was charged by bill of information with possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of La.R.S. 40:966(A)(1)
\[which reads: "... it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or
intentionally: (1) To produce, manufacture, distribute or dispense or
possess with intent to produce, manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a
controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analogue
classified in Schedule I..."\]. After trial in which defendant
represented himself until he fled during a recess following the state's
case in chief, a jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged. The court
eventually reacquired defendant's presence and sentenced him to eight
years imprisonment at hard labor. On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed
his conviction and sentence on grounds that the state's evidence failed
to prove that he had constructive possession of the marijuana found in
the trailer of an 18-wheel truck he had driven from California into
Louisiana where it was stopped in Caddo Parish en route to either
Pennsylvania or New York. *State v. Pigford*, 892 So. 2d 724 (La. App.
2d Cir. 2005). This Court granted review because we agree with the state
that the court of appeal erred by substituting its view of the evidence
for that of the jury and thereby revived as a basis for reversal a
hypothesis of innocence advanced by defendant at trial but rationally
discredited by jurors in reaching their verdict. We therefore reverse
the decision below and reinstate defendant's conviction and sentence.

 The evidence adduced at trial showed the following: On September 25,
2000, a computer weight monitoring system set up on Interstate 20 in
Caddo Parish by state police registered an eastbound Volvo 18-wheeler
3,000 pounds over the state weight limit of 80,000 pounds. The vehicle,
driven by defendant, was directed to pull over into the nearest weigh
station where the truck was weighed on the stationary scales and again
registered 3,000 pounds over the legal limit. Sergeant Brierre Thomas,
with the Louisiana Department of Transportation, Weights and Standard
Unit, and Deputy Danny Williams, a K-9 officer with the Caddo Parish
Sheriff's Office, interviewed defendant. Defendant told them that he was
traveling to New York; however, the bill of lading showed that he was
hauling a load of grapes from Reedley, California to Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

Because they were concerned about the discrepancy in the destination for
the load of grapes and about defendant's seemingly wayward route from
California to either New York or Pennsylvania, Sergeant Thomas and
Deputy Williams asked him to open the back of the trailer so they could
see what he had as cargo. Defendant refused to open the trailer, telling
the officers he was a member of the NAACP, and that he knew he had a
right to refuse to allow the search.

Immediately after defendant refused to open the trailer, Sergeant Thomas
called Peggy Adley, an agent with the Public Service Commission.
Sergeant Thomas testified that he called Adley because she would need to
know what was in the trailer and that she would need to check
defendant's "single state registration" and insurance, and inspect his
load to see if it matched his bill of lading. Officer Adley arrived and
told defendant that she had the right to inspect the trailer without his
consent. Defendant produced a key, unlocked the padlock, and opened the
trailer's doors. At the request of Officer Adley, Officer Thomas climbed
up onto the back of the trailer to inspect the load. The officer
testified that as he stood up at the back of the trailer he saw in
"plain view" the end of a large package sitting on top of the boxes of
grapes, less than an arm's length from the back end of the load. Officer
Thomas turned his head and asked defendant what the object was, and
defendant indicated that he knew nothing about it. The officer then
reached over the stacked boxes of grapes and pulled the package towards
him. The package was wrapped in clear plastic wrap and duct tape; it
measured approximately a foot wide and six-and-a-half to seven feet
long. According to Adley, who stood outside at the rear of the truck,
despite its size, the package was not visible from her vantage point
when she looked through the opened doors of the trailer.

After Thomas removed the package, Deputy Williams cut a slit in the side
and determined that the bundle contained marijuana. In all, the package
contained approximately 52 pounds of marijuana possessing a street value
of \$ 52,000. Both officers testified at trial that the sheer amount of
marijuana, its value, and the manner of its packaging, were all
consistent with an intent to distribute. However, no fingerprints were
found on the package and the officers had otherwise determined that
defendant's bill of lading for his cargo was in good order.

Because defendant fled immediately after the state presented its case in
chief, he did not testify at trial and did not put on a defense case of
his own. Nevertheless, his defense emerged in his opening remarks to
jurors and in cross-examination of the state's witnesses. Defendant
urged jurors to consider that he was not off route because Interstate 20
runs to California, and he promised to produce a map to prove the point.
Defendant also urged jurors to consider that no evidence would establish
that he had witnessed the loading of the trailer in California.
Defendant prompted Deputy Williams to admit that it was possible that
someone loading the load could have placed the marijuana into the truck
while he was sorting out the paperwork before leaving California with
the load, and that someone else could have taken the marijuana off at
the other end, and "...the defendant would never have known what he was
carrying." Defendant also got Williams to admit that he did not remember
if he ever asked him if he watched the truck as it was loaded. It was
therefore entirely possible, defendant suggested, that persons unknown
to him had concealed the marijuana in the trailer without his knowledge
and far enough back from the trailer door that it was not visible to
anyone standing outside, and then alerted other conspirators in New York
waiting to off-load the contraband that the shipment was on its way. As
for the discrepancy in the load's ultimate destination, defendant
suggested that he had been transporting a "blind shipment," one intended
by the broker for a destination other than the one listed on the bill of
lading.

In reversing the defendant's conviction, the Second Circuit panel
emphasized that Sergeant Thomas found the marijuana not in the cab of
the tractor but in the trailer, on top of the truck's legal cargo of
grapes and positioned out of the plain view of anyone standing, as Adley
had, in the opened doors at the rear of the vehicle. On the premise that
"one cannot apply private vehicle case law regarding constructive
possession to drugs found in the cargo area of a common carrier
involving the transportation of goods or persons, *Pigford*, 892 So. 2d
at 730, the court of appeal reasoned that defendant's access to the
cargo area did not alone indicate that he had knowledge of the
contraband concealed in the trailer. In the appellate court's view, the
state needed to present additional evidence demonstrating defendant's
guilty knowledge "to preclude the possibility that the contraband was
put there by third persons during the loading of the cargo, or evidence
proving the driver's knowledge of the contraband in the cargo area."
*Id.* The court of appeal ultimately concluded that the state's evidence
did not exclude the reasonable hypothesis that persons responsible for
loading the trailer placed the marijuana on top of the grapes and out of
sight for unloading by other members of the conspiracy at the
destination point for the truck. In addition, although the tractor was
registered to defendant's wife, who was with him at the time of his
arrest, the state presented no evidence at trial as to the ownership of
the cargo trailer. The state's case therefore did not "preclude the
possibility that the defendant may have backed his Volvo tractor up to
someone else's loaded trailer, hitched the trailer to his tractor,
locked the trailer doors, and driven off." *Pigford*, 892 So. 2d at 731.

However, the pertinent question on review was not whether the appellate
court found that defendant's hypothesis of innocence offered a
reasonable explanation for the evidence at trial but whether jurors
acted reasonably in rejecting it as a basis for acquittal. In reviewing
the sufficiency of evidence, an appellate court must determine that the
evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, or a mixture of both, viewed
in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient to
convince a rational trier of fact that all of the elements of the crime
have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443
U.S. 307 (1979); *State v. Captville*, 448 So. 2d 676, 678 (La. 1984).
This standard ... does not provide the appellate court with a vehicle to
substitute its own appreciation of the evidence for that of the
fact-finder.... Accordingly, in cases relying on circumstantial evidence
to prove one or more elements of the crime, when the fact-finder
reasonably rejects the hypothesis of innocence advanced by the defendant
at trial, that hypothesis fails, and the verdict stands unless the
evidence suggests an alternative hypothesis sufficiently reasonable that
rational jurors could not find proof of the defendant's guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt....

In the present case, the court of appeal justified its decision to
reverse in part on grounds that the state failed to negate the
possibility that defendant simply hooked his tractor up to the wrong
trailer and unwittingly drove off with over \$ 52,000 worth of marijuana
and someone else's legal load of grapes. That alternative hypothesis of
innocence may have been possible, but it clearly was not so probable
that reasonable jurors would necessarily have to entertain a reasonable
doubt of defendant's guilt. As to the hypothesis of innocence actually
advanced by defendant at trial through his cross-examination of the
state's witnesses, *i.e*., that he did not load the trailer and
therefore remained unaware of the marijuana stashed by someone else on
top of his legal load and out of sight to a casual observer, defendant
clearly had dominion and control over the trailer and its contents as
well as his tractor. The trailer had been padlocked only and Officer
Thomas's testimony at trial informed jurors of the difference between a
trailer sealed by the shipper to deny the driver or anyone else access
to the contents during transportation and a trailer merely padlocked, as
to which the driver retains access to the interior and cargo. Officer
Thomas explained that the driver of a sealed cargo would not break the
seal "because the load may be turned down because the load has been
tampered with." The seal thus prevents the driver from gaining access to
the load until it is delivered....

Defendant's dominion and control over the trailer and access to its
contents did not alone establish his guilty knowledge of the marijuana
bundle placed on top of the grape pallets. *See State v. Major*, 888 So.
2d 798, 803 (La. 2004). Nevertheless, guilty knowledge, an essential
component of any showing that a defendant has constructive possession of
contraband, *i.e.*, dominion and control over it although the contraband
is not in his actual possession, *State v. Bell*, 566 So. 2d 959, 960
(La. 1990); *State v. Sweeney*, 443 So. 2d 522, 528 (La. 1983), may be
inferred from the circumstances of the transaction. *Major*, 888 So. 2d
at 803....

In the present case, the court of appeal feared that "to convict a
driver only on the evidence that he had access to the cargo area creates
a dangerous precedent for the many drivers involved in commercial
transportation of goods that happen to have access to the cargo they are
carrying." *Pigford*, 39,306 at 10, 892 So. 2d at 730. However, it
remains possible to subscribe to that reluctance yet still find the
state provided jurors with additional evidence from which a rational
trier of fact could infer defendant's guilty knowledge of the marijuana
stashed inside the trailer. Sergeant Thomas testified that a citation
for an overweight load was a "common occurrence" on the interstate but
that the defendant appeared unusually nervous for such a routine
violation. Defendant also appeared to have gone considerably off course,
given his bill of lading indicating that the trailer had been loaded in
California with pallets of grapes for delivery in the Northeast, either
in Pennsylvania or New York. Defendant never produced his promised map
and jurors might not have known from personal knowledge that I-20 does
not run all of the way to California but reaches only into west Texas
where it connects to I-10, which does run into southern California....
Officer Williams lacked that specific knowledge but nevertheless
testified without contradiction that "it seems like to me it was a long
way around from California to New York coming down this far instead of
going across the midsection.... In my estimation from California going
to New York if you go right through the middle of the country instead of
coming down south and then going up it would be shorter." Thus, whether
defendant lied to the officer by informing him he was on his way to New
York or whether the bill of lading revealed his correct destination in
Pennsylvania, he had embarked on a particularly circuitous course for
delivering the grapes....

 Defendant's apparently wayward course and attempt to conceal his
ultimate destination gave rise to a reasonable inference that he had a
particular and not-so-innocent reason for traveling far out of his way
although engaged in interstate shipment of perishable cargo. The
marijuana may not have been in plain view from outside the trailer but
anyone with access to the cargo could have found the package in the same
way that Officer Thomas discovered it, simply by standing in the back of
the trailer and inspecting the load. The supposed conspirators loading
the trailer had therefore chosen the least likely spot to conceal the
six-to-seven-foot-long marijuana package inside a trailer that was not
sealed by the shipper but padlocked only. In fact, the location of the
marijuana packet on top of the grape pallets at the rear of the trailer
clearly suggested that the contraband had been placed in the trailer
after it was fully loaded and not during the loading process, a scenario
entirely consistent with the state's theory of the case that at some
point after loading defendant used his key to unlock the trailer and
stash his marijuana shipment.

Finally, rational jurors could also consider the likelihood that a
person would commit over \$ 50,000 worth of marijuana to a carrier
completely oblivious of the conspiracy to ship the contraband, although
the load had not been sealed but merely padlocked and the driver
therefore retained access to the trailer's interior and could easily
find the package placed on top of the legal load. *See Major*, 03-3522
at 10, 888 So. 2d at 803 ("'The quantity of drugs and cash in the car
indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a
dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential
to furnish evidence against him.'") (quoting *Maryland v. Pringle*, 540
U.S. 366 (2003)); *see also United States v. Serrano-Lopez*, 366 F.3d
628, 635 (8th Cir. 2004) ("The large quantity of drugs involved is
evidence of the defendants' knowledge. Even if the drugs were not owned
by the defendants, it is unlikely that the owner would place
approximately \$ 130,000 worth of cocaine in the hands of people who do
not even know it is there.").

Under these circumstances, we conclude that jurors reasonably rejected
the hypothesis of innocence advanced by defendant, and that the evidence
presented at trial suggested no other hypothesis necessarily giving rise
to reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilty knowledge of the marijuana
within the trailer. The evidence otherwise supported the jury's finding
that defendant had dominion and control over the contraband by virtue of
his access to the interior of the trailer and that he therefore had
constructive possession of the marijuana, in an amount and value
sufficient to support an inference of intent to distribute. Accordingly,
the decision below is vacated, defendant's conviction and sentence are
reinstated, and this case is remanded to the court of appeal for
consideration of the remaining counseled and pro se assignments of error
pretermitted on original hearing.

Opinion of the court of appeal vacated; conviction and sentence
reinstated; case remanded to court of appeal.

Whitaker v. People

 

Supreme Court of Colorado

48 P.3d 555 (2002)

 

JUSTICE HOBBS delivered the Opinion of the Court.

A jury convicted the defendant, David Whitaker, of possessing with
intent to distribute over 1,000 grams of methamphetamine, a schedule II
controlled substance, and importing methampetamine into Colorado.
Whitaker claimed that his conviction should be reversed because the
trial judge did not instruct the jury to apply the mens rea of
"knowingly" to both the quantity and the importation of the drug. The
court of appeals upheld Whitaker's conviction. We agree.

We hold that the General Assembly, in section 18-18-405, did not intend
to apply a culpable mental state to the quantity of drugs the defendant
distributed, manufactured, dispensed, sold, or possessed. We also hold
that importation under Colorado's special offender statute, section
18-18-407, does not include a mens rea requirement. The jury found
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the drug quantity
specified by section 18-18-405(3)(a)(III), and imported the drugs across
state lines as specified by section 18-18-407(1)(d). Accordingly, we
uphold Whitaker's conviction and sentence.

I.

On January 14, 1998, David Whitaker was a passenger on a Greyhound bus
en route from Los Angeles, California to Denver, Colorado. The bus
stopped in Grand Junction, Colorado for routine service and to change
drivers. Passengers were required to leave the bus during this stop.
After the passengers had reboarded, three Grand Junction Police
Department officers entered the bus, identifying themselves as police
officers. Two of the officers began talking to each of the bus
passengers, including Whitaker.

The officers testified that Whitaker appeared nervous while talking to
them. When asked about his luggage, Whitaker told the police that he had
none. The officers pointed to a black bag near Whitaker and asked if it
was his. Whitaker responded that it was not his bag, but said he had
placed his jacket and a few other items inside it because no one else
appeared to be using it. Whitaker then consented to a search of the bag.
The officers discovered 8.8 pounds of uncut methamphetamine contained in
several duct tape covered packages inside the bag.

The prosecution charged Whitaker with several drug offenses. At trial,
Whitaker argued that he did not possess the drugs and did not know that
the packages of drugs were in the bag. The defense did not dispute the
facts that the bag contained 8.8 pounds of methamphetamine and that the
drugs came across Colorado's state lines via the Greyhound bus. The jury
convicted Whitaker of possessing 1,000 grams or more of a schedule II
controlled substance with intent to distribute and importation of a
schedule II controlled substance. The trial court sentenced him to
twenty years in state prison.

The court of appeals affirmed Whitaker's conviction and sentence.
*People v. Whitaker*, 32 P.3d 511, (Colo. App. 2000). The court of
appeals found that the trial court had correctly instructed the jury on
the elements of possession of 1,000 grams or more of a controlled
substance with intent to distribute and on the charge of importation of
a controlled substance. It held that the prosecution need not prove that
Whitaker "knowingly" imported the controlled substance, nor that the
defendant "knew" the drugs weighed more than 1,000 grams. *Id.* at
517-19. The court concluded that special offender drug importation under
section 18-18-407(1)(d), 6 C.R.S. (2001), and the quantity of a
controlled substance possessed under section 18-18-405, 6 C.R.S. (2001),
have no mens rea requirement. *Id.* at 517-18.

We granted certiorari in *People v. Whitaker*, 32 P.3d 511 (Colo. App.
2000), to review the court of appeals' judgment. We uphold the judgment.

II\.

We hold that the General Assembly, in section 18-18-405, did not intend
to apply a culpable mental state to the quantity of drugs the defendant
distributed, manufactured, dispensed, sold, or possessed. We also hold
that importation under Colorado's special offender statute, section
18-18-407, does not include a mens rea requirement. The jury found
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the drug quantity
specified by section 18-18-405(3)(a)(III), and imported the drugs across
state lines as specified by section 18-18-407(1)(d). Accordingly, we
uphold Whitaker's conviction and sentence.

*A. Section 18-18-405 and Quantity of Drug*

Whitaker argues that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on
the charge of possession with intent to distribute over 1,000 grams of a
controlled substance, because it did not clearly instruct that the mens
rea "knowingly" applied to the drug quantity. We disagree.

Section 18-18-405(3)(a)(III) applies to Whitaker because the jury
convicted him of possessing more than 1,000 grams of methamphetamine, a
schedule II controlled substance, with the intent to distribute. Section
18-18-405(3)(a)(III) defines the required sentence for a defendant
convicted of unlawful distribution, manufacturing, dispensing, sale or
possession of 1,000 grams or more of a schedule I or II controlled
substance.

 Whitaker argues that the quantity of drugs contained in section
18-18-405(3)(a)(III) is an essential element of the crime of possession
with intent to distribute, and the mens rea contained in section
18-18-405(1)(a), "knowingly," must apply to it. However, whether the
quantity of drugs involved in the offense requires a mens rea is a
matter of statutory interpretation. "Our fundamental responsibility in
interpreting a statute is to give effect to the General Assembly's
purpose and intent in enacting the statute." *Empire Lodge Homeowners'
Ass'n v. Moyer*, 39 P.3d 1139, 1152 (Colo. 2001). "If the plain language
of the statute clearly expresses the legislative intent, then the court
must give effect to the ordinary meaning of the statutory language.
Likewise, the court should avoid interpreting a statute in a way that
defeats the obvious intent of the legislature." *Pediatric Neurosurgery,
P.C. v. Russell*, 44 P.3d 1063, 1068 (Colo. 2002). We must read the
statute as a whole, construing each provision consistently and in
harmony with the overall statutory design, if possible. *Id.*; *Empire
Lodge*, 39 P.3d at 1152.

Here, section 18-18-405(1)(a) defines the offense, and the provisions of
18-18-405(2), (3), (5) and (6) set forth the applicable punishment
levels. This statutory structure demonstrates the General Assembly's
intent to separate sentencing factors, such as drug type and quantity,
from the elements of the crime. Section 18-18-405(3)(a) does not
prescribe drug quantity as an element of the offense, nor does it
require proof of a culpable mental state in regards to it. Section
18-18-405(1)(a) sets forth the elements of the crime; the mens rea
applies to each of these.

Although section 18-18-405(1)(a) requires the prosecution to prove that
the defendant "knowingly" distributed, manufactured, dispensed, sold or
possessed the controlled substance, nothing in the statute's language
suggests that the prosecution must show that the defendant "knew" the
actual weight of the drugs under section 18-18-405(3)(a). To the
contrary, section 18-18-405(3)(a) triggers the level of punishment upon
proof that the drug quantity involved in the offense was "an amount that
is or has been represented to be" the amount specified by subsections
(I), (II), or (III) thereunder. In this case, based on the jury's
verdict finding the quantity to be 1000 grams or more of a schedule I or
II controlled substance, section 18-18-405(3)(a)(III) provided for a
sentence to the department of corrections for a term greater than the
maximum presumptive range, but not more than twice the maximum
presumptive range provided for such offense in section 18-1-105(1)(a).

The statute thereby sets forth the drug quantity separately from the
elements, with no mens rea requirement and with the apparent design of
separating the applicable punishment from the creation and definition of
the offense. *People v. Ramirez*, 997 P.2d 1200, 1208, (Colo. App. 1999)
(holding that quantity of a controlled substance possessed is not a
substantive element of the offense), *aff'd by an equally divided
court*, 43 P.3d 611, (Colo. 2001).

Any amount of drugs, even less than a usable quantity, can support a
conviction under 18-18-405(1)(a). *Richardson v. People*, 25 P.3d 54, 58
(Colo. 2001) ("In a possession case, a jury may return a verdict of
guilty if it finds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant
knowingly possessed any quantity of a controlled substance."). The
quantity of drugs turns on objective standards and requires no inquiry
into the defendant's state of mind. *See United States v. Normandeau*,
800 F.2d 953, 956 (9th Cir. 1986) (stating that proof of the amount of
drugs is far different from proof that the defendants knew of the
amount).

The underlying purpose of section 18-18-405(3) is to punish more
severely those offenders who deal with large quantities of controlled
substances. The legislature's choice to do so is within its prerogative.
*People v. Martinez*, 36 P.3d 201, 204, (Colo. App. 2001); *see also
People v. Gorman*, 19 P.3d 662, 666, (Colo. 2000) (stating that we look
to the legislative context to see if a mens rea requirement applies).
Section 18-18-405(3)(a) does not create an additional element for the
underlying substantive offense; rather, it defines circumstances that,
if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, may require a sentence greater than
the presumptive minimum contained in section 18-1-105(1)(a), 6 C.R.S.
(2001). *See People v. Ceja*, 904 P.2d 1308, 1310 (Colo. 1995) (stating
that Colorado Supreme Court cases "have turned not on the quantity of
substance found but rather on the knowing possession of that
substance"); *Ramirez*, 997 P.2d at 1208 ("Section 18-18-405(3)(a), in
itself, does not make possession unlawful and, therefore, does not set
forth an offense.").

Here, the issue of drug quantity went to the jury and the possession
with intent to distribute more than 1,000 grams of a schedule II
controlled substance jury instruction clearly included the quantity of
drugs as a fact that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we
find no error. *See Apprendi v. New Jersey*, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).

*B. Section 18-18-407 and Importation of the Drug*

The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Whitaker imported a
controlled substance into Colorado, a special offender factual finding
for the jury to make under section 18-18-407(1)(d), 6 C.R.S. (2001).
 Whitaker argues a violation of his constitutional due process rights
because the trial court did not instruct the jury to find any culpable
mental state regarding the importation charge. He contends that: (1) the
Colorado special offender statute creates a separate substantive offense
or, alternatively, an additional element for the underlying offense; and
(2) the mens rea of "knowingly" must apply to the special offender
statute, section 18-18-407, 6 C.R.S. (2001). We disagree.

The plain language of Colorado's special offender statute with regard to
importation does not include a culpable mental state. *See* § 18-18-407,
6 C.R.S. (2001). Rather, this provision deals with the level of
punishment. *Vega v. People*, 893 P.2d 107 at 112 (stating that
importation provision addresses punishment, not the creation of a
substantive offense). The plain language of the statute indicates that
"(1) it is triggered only after a felony drug conviction, and (2) its
effect is to increase the required sentencing range upon a finding of
one of the specified 'aggravating circumstances.'" *Vega*, 893 P.2d at
113. "Once a jury has determined that a defendant possessed the mental
state required for conviction of the substantive offense, an enhanced
sentence must be imposed whether or not the defendant fully knew of the
circumstances leading to the special offender finding." *Ramirez*, 997
P.2d at 1205.

 The legislative history of the special offender provision demonstrates
the General Assembly's intent to address punishment rather than defining
the elements of an offense. *Vega*, 893 P.2d at 113 ("During discussion
of the motion to adopt the amendment, Joseph Mackey, one of its
drafters, testified that the special offender provision is 'not a
substantive charge' ...."). The General Assembly added this provision to
the Controlled Substances Act to allow greater penalties for drug
traffickers. *Id.* The legislature accomplished this purpose by listing
certain extraordinary aggravating circumstances that subject a defendant
to a greater sentence as a special offender. 893 P.2d at 112; *Ramirez*,
997 P.2d at 1205.

Colorado law requires the fact-finder to enter a special finding in
regard to the existence of the special offender circumstance. *Ramirez*,
997 P.2d at 1206 ("Notice is required, trial by jury is not eliminated,
and a finding of the existence of the \[special offender circumstance\]
beyond a reasonable doubt is required before a defendant's sentence is
increased.")

In this case, the jury was instructed to find the presence or absence of
the special offender importation fact only if it found Whitaker guilty
of the underlying crime, possession with intent to distribute. Whitaker
argues that the jury verdict form violated his due process rights
because it did not apply a mens rea to the importation of
methamphetamine charge. We disagree. The special offender statute's
importation feature does not include a mens rea requirement. We find no
error.

... Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals
upholding Whitaker's conviction and sentence.

presumptive range provided for such offense in section 18-1-105(1)(a).

5 Because the quantity of drugs is not an element of the offense under
this statutory design, section 18-1-503(4) does not apply. See §
18-1-503(4), 6 C.R.S. 2001 (providing that where a statute defining an
offense contains a culpable mental state, that mental state applies to
every element of the offense, unless an intent to limit its application
clearly appears).

7 Section 18-18-407(1)(d) provides: "The defendant unlawfully
introduced, distributed, or imported into the state of Colorado any
schedule I or II controlled substance (contained in part 2 of this
article)."

Court of Appeals of New York

Chief Judge Kaye.

Penal Law § 220.18 (5) makes it a felony to "knowingly and unlawfully
possess ... six hundred twenty-five milligrams of a hallucinogen." The
question of statutory interpretation before us is whether "knowingly"
applies to the weight of the controlled substance. We conclude that it
does and that the trial evidence was insufficient to satisfy that mental
culpability element....

I.

Viewed in a light most favorable to the People *(People v Contes,* 60
NY2d 620, 621), the trial evidence revealed that on October 2, 1990
defendant asked his friend David Hopkins to order and receive a shipment
of hallucinogenic mushrooms on his behalf. Hopkins agreed, and adhering
to defendant's instructions placed a call to their mutual friend Scott
in San Francisco and requested the "usual shipment." Tipped off to the
transaction, on October 5 State Police Investigator Douglas Vredenburgh
located the package at a Federal Express warehouse in Binghamton. The
package was opened (pursuant to a search warrant) and resealed after its
contents were verified. The investigator then borrowed a Federal Express
uniform and van and delivered the package to Hopkins, the addressee, who
was arrested upon signing for it.

Hopkins explained that the package was for defendant and agreed to
participate in a supervised delivery to him. In a telephone call
recorded by the police, Hopkins notified defendant that he got the
package, reporting a "shit load of mushrooms in there." Defendant
responded, "I know, don't say nothing." At another point Hopkins
referred to the shipment containing two pounds. The men agreed to meet
later that evening at the firehouse in West Oneonta.

At the meeting, after a brief conversation, Hopkins handed defendant a
substitute package stuffed with newspaper. Moments after taking
possession, defendant was arrested. He was later indicted for attempted
criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree....

The case proceeded to trial, where the evidence summarized above was
adduced. Additionally, the police chemist testified that the total
weight of the mushrooms in Hopkins' package was 932.8 grams (about two
pounds), and that a 140-gram sample of the package contents contained
796 milligrams of psilocybin, a hallucinogen (Penal Law § 220.00 \[9\];
Public Health Law § 3306 \[schedule I\] \[d\] \[19\]). He did not know,
however, the process by which psilocybin appears in mushrooms, whether
naturally, by injection or some other means. Nor was there any evidence
as to how much psilocybin would typically appear in two pounds of
mushrooms.

At the close of the People's case, defendant moved to dismiss for
insufficient proof that he knew the level of psilocybin in the
mushrooms, and also requested a charge-down to seventh degree attempted
criminal possession, which has no weight element. Both applications were
denied, defendant was convicted as charged, and he was sentenced as a
second felony offender to 10 years-to-life.

The Appellate Division affirmed. The court held that a defendant must
know the nature of the substance possessed, and acknowledged that the
weight of the controlled substance is an element of the crime. The court
declined, however, to read the statute as requiring that a defendant
have actual knowledge of the weight. Instead, the court held that "the
term 'knowingly' should be construed to refer only to the element of
possession and not to the weight requirement." (184 AD2d 24, 27.)

Finding ample evidence that defendant intended and attempted to possess
psilocybin while knowing the nature of the substance, and that the
weight of the psilocybin ultimately proved to be more than 625
milligrams, the Appellate Division sustained the conviction. Similarly,
because there was no reasonable view of the evidence that the weight of
the psilocybin in the mushrooms was less than 625 milligrams, the court
rejected the argument that the trial court erred in refusing the
charge-down....

We now reverse.

II\.

Although the present case involves an attempt, analysis begins with the
elements of the completed crime, second degree criminal possession of a
controlled substance. Penal Law § 220.18 (5) provides:

"A person is guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in
the second degree when he knowingly and unlawfully possesses: ...

"5. six hundred twenty-five milligrams of a hallucinogen."

It is undisputed that the knowledge requirement of the statute applies
to the element of possession *(see also,* Penal Law § 15.00 \[2\]), and
that defendant must also have "actual knowledge of the nature of the
possessed substance" *(People v Reisman,* 29 NY2d 278, 285). At issue is
whether defendant must similarly know the weight of the material
possessed. That is a question of statutory interpretation, as to which
the Court's role is clear: our purpose is not to pass on the wisdom of
the statute or any of its requirements, but rather to implement the will
of the Legislature as expressed in its enactment *(People v Smith,* 79
NY2d 309, 311).

In effectuating legislative intent, we look first of course to the
statutory language. Read in context, it seems evident that "knowingly"
does apply to the weight element. Indeed, given that a defendant's
awareness must extend not only to the fact of possessing something
("knowingly ... possesses") but also to the nature of the material
possessed ("knowingly ... possesses ... a hallucinogen"), any other
reading would be strained. Inasmuch as the knowledge requirement carries
through to the end of the sentence *(see, People v Reisman,* 29 NY2d, at
285), eliminating it from the intervening element---weight---would rob
the statute of its obvious meaning. We conclude, therefore, that there
is a *mens rea* element associated with the weight of the drug.

That reading is fortified by two rules of construction ordained by the
Legislature itself. First, a "statute defining a crime, unless clearly
indicating a legislative intent to impose strict liability, should be
construed as defining a crime of mental culpability" (Penal Law § 15.15
\[2\]). If any material element of an offense lacks a *mens rea*
requirement, it is a strict liability crime (Penal Law § 15.10).
Conversely, a crime is one of "mental culpability" only when a mental
state "is required with respect to every material element of an offense"
*(id.).*

By ruling that a defendant need not have knowledge of the weight, the
Appellate Division in effect held, to that extent, that second degree
criminal possession is a strict liability crime *(see,* Penal Law §
15.10). That is an erroneous statutory construction unless a legislative
intent to achieve that result is "clearly indicat\[ed\]" (Penal Law §
15.15 \[2\]).

In a similar vein, the Legislature has provided in Penal Law § 15.15
(1):

"Construction of statutes with respect to culpability requirements.

"1. When the commission of an offense defined in this chapter, or some
element of an offense, requires a particular culpable mental state, such
mental state is ordinarily designated in the statute defining the
offense by use of the terms "intentionally,' *'knowingly,'* 'recklessly'
or 'criminal negligence,' or by use of terms, such as 'with intent to
defraud' and 'knowing it to be false,' describing a specific kind of
intent or knowledge. *When one and only one of such terms appears in a
statute defining an offense, it is presumed to apply to every element of
the offense unless an intent to limit its application clearly appears."*
(Emphasis added.)

Accordingly, if a single *mens rea* is set forth, as here, it
presumptively applies to all elements of the offense unless a contrary
legislative intent is plain.

We discern no "clear" legislative intent to make the weight of a drug a
strict liability element, as is required before we can construe the
statute in that manner (Penal Law § 15.15 \[1\], \[2\]). Moreover, the
over-all structure of the drug possession laws supports the view that a
defendant must have some knowledge of the weight.

There are six degrees of criminal possession of a controlled substance,
graded in severity from a class A misdemeanor (Penal Law § 220.03
\[seventh degree\]) up to an A-I felony (Penal Law § 220.21 \[first
degree\]). The definition of each begins identically: "A person is
guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the degree
when he knowingly and unlawfully possesses ...." The primary
distinctions between one grade or another relate to the type and weight
of the controlled substance, and in some instances the existence of an
intent to sell *(e.g.,* Penal Law § 220.16 \[1\]) or intent to sell
combined with a prior drug conviction *(e.g.,* Penal Law § 220.09
\[13\]).

Taking hallucinogens as an example, knowing and unlawful possession of
any amount, even a trace *(see, People v Mizell,* 72 NY2d 651, 655) is
seventh degree possession (Penal Law § 220.03); 25 milligrams or more,
fourth degree (Penal Law § 220.09 \[6\]); 125 milligrams or more, third
degree (Penal Law § 220.16 \[10\]; and 625 milligrams, second degree
(Penal Law § 220.18 \[5\]). The maximum penalty for these crimes ranges
from one-year incarceration to a life sentence, yet the only statutory
difference relates to the weight of the drugs. To ascribe to the
Legislature an intent to mete out drastic differences in punishment
without a basis in culpability would be inconsistent with notions of
individual responsibility and proportionality prevailing in the Penal
Law *(see, e.g.,* Penal Law § 1.05 \[4\]).

Our cases, too, have suggested that knowledge of the weight is an
element. In *People v Scarborough* (49 NY2d 364, 374), for example, a
case involving a similarly worded criminal sale of a controlled
substance statute *(see,* Penal Law § 220.41), we concluded "that there
is no substance to defendant Scarborough's claim of insufficiency of
proof on the issue of her *knowledge of the weight* or the nature of the
contents of the glassine envelopes which she delivered to the buyer"
(emphasis added)....

In sum, the plain language of the statute, rules of construction, the
format of the drug possession laws and our cases all lead to the
conclusion that the Appellate Division erred in holding that there is no
*mens rea* requirement associated with the weight of a controlled
substance.

III\.

The People's contrary argument is based in part on a concern that it
would be "prohibitively difficult," if not impossible, to secure
convictions if they were required to prove that a defendant had
knowledge of the weight. We disagree.

Often there will be evidence from which the requisite knowledge may be
deduced, such as negotiations concerning weight, potency or price *(see,
e.g., People v Acosta,* 80 NY2d 665, 668, n 1, *and* 672-673).
Similarly, for controlled substances measured on an "aggregate weight"
basis *(see, e.g.,* Penal Law § 220.06 \[2\]), knowledge of the weight
may be inferred from defendant's handling of the material, because the
weight of the entire mixture, including cutting agents, is counted *(see
generally,* Rosenblatt, *New York's New Drug Laws and Sentencing
Statutes*, at 45-48 \[1973\]; Donnino, *Practice Commentaries*,
McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law art 220, at 9 \[comparing
aggregate and pure weight statutes\]).

By contrast, that same inference may be unavailable for controlled
substances measured by "pure" weight, like psilocybin. The effective
doses of these drugs may be minuscule, and they are customarily combined
with other substances to facilitate handling and use. In these
circumstances it may indeed be difficult to show defendant's knowledge
of the weight. Although we cannot simply read the knowledge requirement
out of the statute, these "compelling practical considerations" may
inform our interpretation of that element *(see, People v Mizell,* 72
NY2d, at 654).

The Legislature has decided that persons who illegally possess larger
quantities of controlled substances should be punished more severely;
their conduct is more repugnant and presents a greater threat to
society. Because drug possession is not a strict liability crime,
however, an individual is not deserving of enhanced punishment unless he
or she is aware that the amount possessed is greater. A purpose of the
knowledge requirement, then, is to avoid overpenalizing someone who
unwittingly possesses a larger amount of a controlled substance than
anticipated.

That legislative purpose can be satisfied, among other ways, with
evidence that the pure weight of the controlled substance possessed by
defendant is typical for the particular form in which the drug appears.
This correlation between the pure weight typically found, and the pure
weight actually possessed, substantially reduces the possibility that a
person will unjustly be convicted for a more serious crime.

To illustrate: a person may knowingly possess 50 doses of LSD on blotter
paper but, understandably, have no awareness what the pure LSD weighs;
upon chemical analysis it is determined that defendant actually
possessed 2.5 milligrams. If there is evidence that a typical dose of
LSD weighs .05 milligrams *(see, Chapman v United States,* 500 U.S. 453,
457), the jury could conclude, within the meaning of the statute, that
defendant knowingly possessed more than 1 milligram, and convict of
fourth degree possession (Penal Law § 220.09 \[5\] \[1 mg or more\]).
If, however, because of some manufacturing defect unknown to defendant
those 50 doses weighed 10 milligrams, defendant should not be convicted
of more serious third degree possession (Penal Law § 220.16 \[9\] \[5 mg
or more\]).

There may of course be other ways of proving defendant's knowledge
within the meaning of the statute. Our purpose today, however, is not to
survey all of the permissible methods but to clarify that the statute
does in fact contain a weight-related mental culpability element.

IV\.

With the foregoing principles in mind, we consider whether there was
sufficient evidence to convict defendant of attempted second degree
possession, an A-II felony.

Certainly there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could
conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant attempted and
intended to possess a two-pound box of hallucinogenic mushrooms. It is
also undisputed that, upon testing, the mushrooms in the particular box
defendant attempted to possess---the one sent to Hopkins by
Scott---contained more than 650 milligrams of psilocybin. The issue we
must decide, however, is whether sufficient evidence was presented at
trial from which it could be inferred that defendant had the requisite
knowledge of the weight.

We disagree with the People's suggestion that the evidence of
defendant's knowing attempt to possess two pounds of mushrooms, without
more, could satisfy their burden of proof. The controlled substance here
is psilocybin; had defendant ordered a specific quantity of that drug,
plainly that would satisfy the knowledge element. But defendant
attempted to possess two pounds of mushrooms, only a small portion of
which was pure psilocybin.

Although in these circumstances defendant could properly be convicted of
attempting to possess the amount of psilocybin that would typically
appear in two pounds of hallucinogenic mushrooms, there was no evidence
linking psilocybin weight to mushroom weight. Indeed, there was no
evidence indicating whether psilocybin grows naturally or is injected
into the mushrooms, or of the usual dose of the drug---matters not
within the ken of the typical juror. We thus conclude on this record
that there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the knowledge
requirement within the meaning of the statute.

That deficiency does not absolve defendant of all criminal liability.
There is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for the
lesser-included offense of attempted criminal possession of a controlled
substance in the seventh degree (Penal Law § 220.03), which does not
have a weight element....

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and
the indictment dismissed with leave to the People to institute such
proceedings as they deem appropriate respecting the lesser-included
offense of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in
the seventh degree.

Judges Simons, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Smith concur with Chief Judge
Kaye; Judge Bellacosa dissents ...; Judge Levine taking no part.

2 Unlawfully" is not a term of mental culpability but means "in
violation of article thirty-three of the public health law" (Penal Law §
220.00 \[2\]).

Cameron, J.

Defendant was found guilty by the court sitting without a jury of the
crime of attempted possession of dangerous drugs in violation of A.R.S.
§§ 32-1996, 13-1001, 13-701, 13-801. The crime was treated as a
misdemeanor, and defendant was placed on probation. We have jurisdiction
pursuant to Rule 47(e)(5), Rules of the Supreme Court, 17A A.R.S.

We must answer only one question on appeal: May the defendant be charged
with attempted possession of dangerous drugs when it was impossible for
him to complete the crime of possession of dangerous drugs because the
drugs were not, in fact, dangerous?

The facts necessary for a determination of this matter on appeal are as
follows. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 8 December 1978, the Yuma County
Sheriff's Office received a call to investigate the presence of two
suspicious persons near a residence on Highway 95 in Yuma County,
Arizona. The two persons told the officer who came to investigate that
they were hitchhiking. The defendant asked a deputy sheriff for a ride
into Yuma. The deputy agreed and, pursuant to standard procedure, patted
the defendant down for weapons. During the search, the deputy found a
plastic bag in defendant's shirt. The deputy took the bag, looked at it,
and found it contained white pills. The defendant stated that the pills
were "speed" or amphetamines, and that he had purchased them earlier at
a bar. Later the deputy found another plastic bag with more white pills
in the back seat of the patrol vehicle after placing defendant in the
back seat.

A field test showed positive for amphetamines, the defendant was advised
of his *Miranda* rights, and defendant again stated that the pills were
"speed." Later analysis by a chemist indicated that the pills were not
amphetamines or dangerous drugs of any kind proscribed by statute.

Trial was held before the court without a jury. After the State's case,
the defendant moved for a directed verdict which was denied. Defendant
did not present any evidence at trial. The court found defendant guilty
and defendant appealed.

The defendant was charged with "attempt" to possess dangerous drugs. Our
statute reads:

"§ 13-1001. Attempt; classifications

"A. A person commits attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability
otherwise required for commission of an offense, such person:

"1. Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute an offense
if the attendant circumstances were as such person believes them to be;
..."

The courts are not in agreement as to when impossibility may be used as
a defense to the crime of attempt. A distinction that has been made is
whether the impossibility alleged is a legal impossibility or a factual
impossibility. See Annot., *Conspiracy, Attempt---Crime Impossible*, 37
A.L.R.3d 375 (1971). Where the act, if completed, would still not be a
criminal act, then it is said to be legally impossible to commit and is
a valid defense to the charge of attempt. For example, in *Foster v.
Commonwealth*, 96 Va. 306, 31 S.E. 503 (1898), the defendant was under
14 years of age and by law was conclusively presumed to be incapable of
committing rape. The court held that because of his age it was legally
impossible for him to be convicted of rape, and he could not "as a plain
legal deduction" be convicted of attempted rape. 96 Va. at 311, 31 S.E.
at 505. Where the crime is impossible to complete because of some
physical or factual condition unknown to the defendant, the
impossibility is factual rather than legal. The courts have held that
factual impossibility is not a valid defense. See Annot., supra. For
example, the California Supreme Court has held that a person attempting
to possess heroin, when in fact the substance was talcum powder, was
nevertheless guilty of attempted possession of heroin. The court stated:

"'If there is an apparent ability to commit the crime in the way
attempted, the attempt is indictable, although, unknown to the person
making the attempt, the crime cannot be committed, because the means
employed are in fact unsuitable, or because of extrinsic facts, such as
the nonexistence of some essential object, or an obstruction by the
intended victim or by a third person.' 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law, § 77, p.
142." *People v. Siu*, 126 Cal. App.2d 41, 44, 271 P.2d 575, 576-77
(1954).

Our Court of Appeals has stated in upholding a conviction for attempt to
receive stolen property where the property was not in fact stolen:

"We therefore hold that legal impossibility is not a bar to prosecution
for an attempt to receive stolen property. The rationale for this
conclusion is that but for factors unknown to appellant, he committed
acts which would have been sufficient to complete the substantive crime
and exhibited the requisite intent. (footnote omitted)" *State v.
Vitale*, 23 Ariz. App. 37, 44, 530 P.2d 394, 401 (1975).

Although there are attempt cases allowing the defense of legal
impossibility, *United States v. Oviedo*, 525 F.2d 881 (5th Cir. 1976),
... our statute, A.R.S. § 13-1001, by the phrase "intentionally engages
in conduct which would constitute an offense if the attendant
circumstances were as such person believes them to be;" reflects the
intent of the legislature that factual impossibility is not a defense to
the crime of attempt.

There can be no doubt that the defendant could never have been convicted
of possession of dangerous drugs. However, if the pills were what
defendant thought them to be, he could have been convicted of possession
of drugs. The defendant believed he had the ability to accomplish the
crime of possession, and the fact that the pills were not dangerous
drugs does not erase his attempt to possess. Mere intent alone does not
amount to an "attempt," *People v. Siu*, supra, but intent plus conduct
toward the commission of a crime may be an attempt. In the instant case,
defendant's conduct indicated not only intent, but an attempt to
complete the crime of possession. We find no error. Affirmed.

Kaye, J.

A person who, with intent to possess cocaine, orders from a supplier,
admits a courier into his or her home, examines the drugs and ultimately
rejects them because of perceived defects in quality, has attempted to
possess cocaine within the meaning of the Penal Law. As the evidence was
legally sufficient to establish this sequence of events, we reinstate
defendant's conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled
substance in the first degree.

I.

By jury verdict, defendant was convicted of conspiracy and attempted
possession of cocaine. The latter charge---the only one at issue on this
appeal---centers on the events of March 21, 1988.

Evidence at trial revealed that, commencing in November 1986, officers
of the Manhattan North Narcotics Division began investigating the
activities of defendant, his brother Miguel and others. Their
investigation techniques included the use of an undercover officer to
infiltrate the organization, stakeouts and court-authorized wiretaps. In
July 1987 the undercover met with Miguel at a Manhattan apartment and
purchased cocaine. At that time, Miguel introduced defendant to the
officer, telling her that they "work together."

A wiretap on defendant's telephone at his Bronx apartment revealed that
for several days prior to March 21, 1988, he was negotiating with Luis
Rojas to purchase kilogram quantities of cocaine. On March 21, at 11:37
A.M., Rojas called defendant and asked, "are you ready?" Defendant
replied "come by here" and Rojas responded, "I'm going over." At 11:42,
defendant called "Frank," an associate, and told him that he "spoke to
the man" who would be "coming over here .... Right now."

About a half hour later, around 12:15 P.M., officers staking out
defendant's six-floor apartment building saw a man pull up in a car,
remove a black and white plastic bag from the trunk, and enter the
building. The bag's handles were stretched, indicating that the contents
were heavy. At 12:30, the man emerged from the building, carrying the
same plastic bag which still appeared to be heavy. He placed the bag
back in the trunk and drove off.

Minutes later, at 12:37 P.M., defendant called Frank, stating that he
"saw the man" but "those tickets ... were no good; they weren't good for
the game man." Frank wondered whether "they got more expensive, the
seats" and defendant explained that they were the "same price and all"
but they were "not the same seats ... some seats real bad, very bad,
very bad." Defendant elaborated: "two pass tickets together on the
outside stuck together, like a thing, like a ticket falsified. Then I
told him to take it away, no, I don't want any problems and anything you
see." Frank asked if defendant was told when the tickets would arrive,
and defendant responded "No because who came was someone, somebody else,
the guy, the messenger." Defendant acknowledged that he "want\[s\] to
participate in the game but if you can't see it, you're going to come
out upset."

At 12:50 P.M., Rojas called defendant and said something inaudible about
"my friend." Defendant responded, "Oh yes, but he left because
(inaudible) it doesn't fit me. ... You told me it was the same thing,
same ticket." Rojas rejoined, "No. We'll see each other at six."

Finally, at 1:26 P.M., defendant telephoned Hector Vargas, who wanted to
know "what happened?" Defendant said, "Nothing. I saw something there,
what you wanted, but I returned it because it was a shit there." Hector
wanted to know, "like how?" but defendant simply responded, "No, no, a
weird shit there." Vargas suggested that he might be able to obtain
something "white and good."

The following day, defendant again called Vargas to discuss "the thing
you told me about, you know what I'm referring to". Defendant
recommended that Vargas "go talk to him, talk to him personally and
check it out." Defendant thought that "it would be better if you took
the tickets, at least one or whatever."

At trial, in motions before and after the verdict, defendant argued that
the foregoing evidence was insufficient to establish that he attempted
to possess cocaine on March 21. The trial court rejected those arguments
and sentenced defendant, upon the jury's guilty verdict, to a prison
term of 25 years to life, the maximum permitted by law.

On appeal, a sharply divided Appellate Division reversed and vacated the
attempted possession conviction, the majority concluding that "\[e\]ven
were we to accept \[the\] attenuated inference that the visitor actually
reached defendant's apartment and offered his contraband to him, the
remaining evidence shows defendant's flat rejection of that offer, and
thus total abandonment of the criminal enterprise with respect to this
particular quantity of cocaine." (172 AD2d 103, 105-106.) One of the
dissenting Justices granted the People leave to appeal, and we now
reverse.

II\.

A person knowingly and unlawfully possessing a substance weighing at
least four ounces and containing a narcotic drug is guilty of criminal
possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (Penal Law §
220.21 \[1\]). Under the Penal Law, "\[a\] person is guilty of an
attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, he \[or
she\] engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such
crime." (Penal Law § 110.00.) While the statutory formulation of attempt
would seem to cover a broad range of conduct---anything "tend\[ing\] to
effect" a crime---case law requires a closer nexus between defendant's
acts and the completed crime.

In *People v Rizzo* (246 NY 334, 337), we observed that in demarcating
punishable attempts from mere preparation to commit a crime, a "line has
been drawn between those acts which are remote and those which are
proximate and near to the consummation." In *Rizzo,* this Court drew
that line at acts "very near to the accomplishment of the intended
crime." *(Id.,* at 337.) Though apparently more stringent than the Model
Penal Code "substantial step" test (Model Penal Code § 5.01 \[1\]
\[c\])---a test adopted by some Federal courts *(see, e.g., United
States v Jackson,* 560 F2d 112 \[2d Cir\], *cert denied* 434 US
941)---in this State we have adhered to *Rizzo's* "very near" or
"dangerously near" requirement, despite the later enactment of Penal Law
§ 110.00 *(see, People v Mahboubian,* 74 NY2d 174, 191; *People v
Warren,* 66 NY2d 831, 833; *People v Di Stefano,* 38 NY2d 640, 652).

A person who orders illegal narcotics from a supplier, admits a courier
into his or her home and examines the quality of the goods has
unquestionably passed beyond mere preparation and come "very near" to
possessing those drugs. Indeed, the only remaining step between the
attempt and the completed crime is the person's acceptance of the
proffered merchandise, an act entirely within his or her control *(see,
People v Mahboubian,* 74 NY2d, at 192, *supra).*

Our decision in *People v Warren* (66 NY2d 831) is thus readily
distinguishable, as Justice Asch, dissenting at the Appellate Division,
recognized. In that case, an informant and an undercover officer posing
as a cocaine seller met defendants in a hotel room and reached an
agreement for the sale of about half a pound. The actual exchange,
however, was to occur hours later, in another part of town, after
repackaging and testing. Moreover, when defendants were arrested at that
meeting, the sellers had insufficient cocaine on hand and defendants had
insufficient funds. We concluded that since "several contingencies stood
between the agreement in the hotel room and the contemplated purchase,"
defendants did not come "very near" to accomplishment of the intended
crime (66 NY2d, at 833). The same cannot be said here.

Significantly, neither the Appellate Division nor the dissent in this
Court disputes the proposition that a person who arranges for the
delivery of drugs and actually examines them has come sufficiently close
to the completed crime to qualify as an attempt. Rather, the Appellate
Division relies on two other grounds for reversal: (i) the evidence was
insufficient to establish that defendant in fact met with a drug courier
and examined his wares; and (ii) in any event, defendant's ultimate
rejection of the drugs constituted an abandonment of the criminal
enterprise, vitiating the attempt. (The dissent in this Court is limited
to the first ground.) Neither ground is persuasive.

Sufficiency of the Evidence

A jury, of course, concluded from the evidence presented that defendant
attempted to possess cocaine on March 21, 1988. In examining the record
for legal sufficiency, "the evidence must be viewed in a light most
favorable to the People ... to determine whether there is a valid line
of reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational jury could
have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt"
*(People v Steinberg,* 79 NY2d 673, 681-682). This deferential standard
is employed because the courts' role on legal sufficiency review is
simply to determine whether enough evidence has been presented so that
the resulting verdict was lawful....

Applying these governing standards, we conclude that the evidence was
legally sufficient to support the jury's finding that defendant met with
a drug courier in his home on March 21. About a half-hour after
defendant's supplier, Rojas, told defendant that he would be coming
over, the police saw a man enter the apartment building with a
weighted-down plastic bag and emerge 15 minutes later with the same
heavy bag. Contemporaneously with the unidentified man's departure,
defendant reported to an associate that he met with a messenger but that
he rejected the offer because the "seats" were "very bad" and the
"tickets" looked "falsified." When Rojas immediately called defendant
asking about his "friend," defendant explained that "he left" and
complained that Rojas misrepresented that the "same ticket" would be
brought. And shortly thereafter, defendant called Vargas and told him
that he "saw something there, what you wanted, but I returned it because
it was a shit there."

... \[T\]he jury knew from defendant's many earlier conversations about
"tickets" and his meeting with the undercover that he was involved with
drugs. Further, the jury knew that in the days immediately preceding
March 21 defendant was negotiating with Rojas to buy kilos of cocaine
and that on March 21 Rojas said that he was coming over. The
unidentified man's visit to the apartment building with the
parcel---coinciding to the minute with defendant's conversations---was
fully consistent with defendant's several later admissions that he had
met with a courier but rejected his merchandise. While the dissent would
ignore the totality of this evidence, the jury most assuredly was not
required to do so.

Rejection as Abandonment

We similarly disagree with the Appellate Division's suggestion that
defendant's "flat rejection" of the drugs vitiated the attempt. Penal
Law § 40.10 (3) provides an affirmative defense to an attempt charge
"under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation
of \[the\] criminal purpose". To qualify for this defense, "the
abandonment must be permanent, not temporary or contingent, not simply a
decision to postpone the criminal conduct until another time" *(People v
Taylor,* 80 NY2d 1, 13-14).

An abandonment theory is inapposite here.... \[T\]he evidence revealed
that even after rejecting the March 21 offer, defendant continued making
efforts to obtain cocaine. Thus, while it may be true that there was an
abandonment "with respect to \[that\] particular quantity of cocaine"
(172 AD2d, at 106, *supra),* this is immaterial for purposes of the
statutory renunciation defense. Rather, there must be an abandonment of
over-all criminal enterprise *(see, People v Taylor,* 80 NY2d, at 14,
*supra),* which on this record plainly was not the case....

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, the
conviction for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance
in the first degree reinstated, and the case remitted to that court for
consideration of the facts.

 

Smith, J., dissenting.

To uphold defendant's conviction of an attempt, it must be shown beyond
a reasonable doubt that his acts came "dangerously close" to committing
the substantive crime. That someone got out of a car carrying a bag and
entered the apartment building adds nothing to the proof of the
attempted crime. There was no proof of who this man was, what was in the
bag, where the man went inside the building or who owned the car. Any
connection of this proof with defendant would necessarily be based on
pure speculation. The critical question, then, is whether defendant's
wiretapped phone calls, standing alone, or even in conjunction with the
evidence of a man and his bag, could constitute sufficient evidence for
a finding of guilt. Without more, these phone conversations, and other
evidence submitted, were insufficient to show that defendant came
"dangerously close" to possessing drugs. I, therefore, dissent.

The police obtained a court order authorizing a wiretap of defendant's
telephone.... A police officer assigned to stakeout defendant's
apartment building testified at trial that shortly after noon on March
21, 1988, he observed a small white four-door vehicle drive up to the
front of the six-story apartment building in which defendant lived. The
officer also testified that he saw a male Hispanic exit the car, remove
a black and white plastic bag with long, completely stretched handles
from the trunk, and enter the courtyard leading to the building. No one
followed the person into the building to ascertain where he went. The
officer testified further that the same man left the building 15 minutes
later with the same bag with similarly stretched handles. According to
the officer, the man walked to the rear of his vehicle, opened the
trunk, placed the bag back inside, got into the vehicle, drove a few
feet, made a U-turn, and drove back past the police vehicle in which he
was seated. The officer testified that he never stopped the driver of
the white vehicle or ascertained what was in the bag. This incident,
along with overheard conversations of defendant that he had rejected
"tickets" (allegedly cocaine), presented the sole basis for convicting
defendant of attempted possession of a controlled substance in the first
degree.

Defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of attempted criminal
possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy
to possess a controlled substance in the second degree....

This Court has held that Penal Law § 110.00 requires a showing that
defendant "committed an act or acts that carried the project forward
within dangerous proximity to the criminal end to be attained" *(People
v Warren,* 66 NY2d 831, 832).... In *Warren (supra),* this Court
affirmed the dismissal of indictments charging two defendants with
attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance where several
contingencies stood between an earlier agreement to purchase and the
contemplated purchase. The Grand Jury testimony showed that the
defendants agreed to purchase cocaine from a police informant, but the
transaction was not consummated because the informant did not have
enough cocaine, the defendants did not have enough money, and the
cocaine was not properly packaged. The informant agreed to meet the
defendants later that evening to test the cocaine and effect the
transaction. Before the informant departed, and while defendants were
examining one-ounce bags of cocaine, police officers who were secretly
watching the transaction entered the room and arrested them. This Court
concluded that "the defendants did not come very near to the
accomplishment of the intended crime" *(id.,* at 833).

Here, too, the evidence adduced at trial does not establish that
defendant came very near to the accomplishment of the crime of
possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. According to
the wiretap information, defendant had been anticipating a delivery of
"tickets" from his suppliers for resale to a customer. The police
observed an Hispanic male enter and leave the courtyard of the apartment
building in which defendant lived carrying a heavy-laden shopping bag.
The People assert that the unidentified male brought a supply of cocaine
to defendant's apartment and defendant rejected the supply. However, the
stakeout police officer did not stop and question the Hispanic male or
ascertain what was in the shopping bag, nor did he observe the male
approach or enter defendant's apartment. Thus, the testimony that an
unidentified man entered and exited defendant's apartment building
amounts to no material evidence at all.

The sole basis for defendant's guilt was the wiretap conversations in
which defendant told another individual that he had just rejected a
delivery of "tickets" as unacceptable because it was "no good" and
"stuck together." The evidence adduced simply does not establish beyond
a reasonable doubt the attempted possession of cocaine by the defendant.

1 These conversations were routinely conducted in code words such as
"tickets" or "tires" which the prosecution expert testified represented
kilos of cocaine. Many such conversations were recorded in the weeks
leading up to defendant's arrest.

3 Indeed, the statute interpreted in *Rizzo*, former Penal Law § 2, is
similar to the present version. The repealed statute provided: "An act,
done with intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect
its commission, is 'an attempt to commit that crime.'" Under the revised
Penal Law, all attempts were initially classified for sentencing
purposes at a lower grade than the completed crime (see, L 1965, ch
1030), but subsequent legislation, premised on the belief that certain
attempts---including attempted possession of a controlled substance in
the first degree---were as serious as the completed crime, classified
the attempt at the same grade as the consummated crime (see, Penal Law §
110.05 \[1\]; Donnino, *Practice Commentaries*, McKinney's Cons Laws of
NY, Book 39, Penal Law § 110.05, at 427).

 

 

 

Notes on attempt liability

 

*The common law of impossible attempts*: "Incomplete attempts" describe
cases in which the defendant starts his efforts to commit a crime and
does some of the conduct necessary to commit it, but then for some
reason stops before carrying out all the conduct necessary to complete
the offense. "Complete attempts" describe cases in which an actor
carries out all the conduct necessary for accomplishing the crime, and
yet the crime is not accomplished for some reason. Think, for example,
of a defendant who shoots a firearm at another intending to kill them,
and yet does not, in fact, hit (or at least kill) the intended victim.
In this scenario, it was *possible* for the actor to complete the crime,
but for some reason (he's a bad shot, the gun misfired, etc.) he did
not. In other "complete attempt" scenarios, however, completing the
crime is *not* possible for some reason even if the defendant does
everything right (he has perfect aim, the gun functions properly, etc.)
Perhaps, for example, the person he shot and intended to kill was not,
in fact a person but a mannequin or wax figure.

For complete-attempt scenarios in which the crime was for some reason
impossible to accomplish, many common law courts drew a distinction
between "legal impossibility" and \"factual impossibility." The standard
rule was that \"legal impossibility *is* a defense." Put differently,
one cannot be convicted for attempting a crime that is \"legally
impossible\" to complete. \"Factual impossibility,\" on the other hand,
was not a defense. A crime was said to be "factually impossible" if it
was incapable of being completed solely because of some fact unknown to
the defendant. See, e.g., State v. Moretti, 52 N.J. 182, 190 (1968)
("when the consequences sought by a defendant are forbidden by the law
as criminal, it is no defense that the defendant could not succeed in
reaching his goal because of circumstance unknown to him.").

Eventually, however, many courts came to recognize that the distinction
made little sense. The California Supreme Court's observation in *People
v. Camodeca*, 52 Cal. 2d 142, 147, 338 P.2d 903, 906 (1959), came to be
shared by many courts: "what is a 'legal impossibility' as distinguished
from a 'physical or factual impossibility' has over a long period of
time perplexed our courts and has resulted in many irreconcilable
decisions."

Consider the following "impossible attempt" cases and see if you discern
which are properly characterized as "legally impossible" and which as
"factually impossible."

In State v. Guffey, 262 S.W.2d 152 (Mo. App. 1953), the court overturned
the conviction of a defendant who had been convicted of attempting to
shoot wildlife out of season because the thing he shot was not a live
animal but a stuffed decoy deer, set up as a part of sting operation by
state conversation agents. (Such "Robo-Deer" sting operations continue
to be a strategy of state natural resources agencies charged with
reducing illegal hunting. See examples on
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/AgOipZyp4-g).)

In State v. Taylor, 133 S.W.2d 336 (Mo. 1939), the Missouri Supreme
Court reversed the defendant's conviction for attempting to corrupt a
person summoned to jury service because the person he attempted to bribe
had by that time been excused from jury service and so was no longer a
"summoned juror."

In People v. Teal, 196 N.Y. 372 (1909), New York's high court overturned
a conviction for attempted subornation of perjury---i.e., an attempt to
convince a witness to lie under oath about some topic that is relevant
(or "material") to the trial in which they testify. The court concluded
that the testimony that the defendant "attempted to suborn" was
irrelevant to the case, and that one cannot commit subornation of
perjury by soliciting false, but irrelevant, testimony. In that
scenario, "the person through whose procuration the testimony is given
cannot be guilty of subornation of perjury and, by the same rule, an
unsuccessful attempt to that which is not a crime when effectuated,
cannot be held to be an attempt to commit the crime specified." Id. at
377.

In State v. Mitchell, 170 Mo. 633 (1902), the court affirmed a
conviction for attempted murder for a defendant who had shot into the
room in which his intended victim usually slept; the bullet struck the
pillow on which the intended victim usually slept---although on this
particular night he happened to be sleeping in another room of the
house.

In State v. Moretti, 52 N.J. 182 (1968), the court affirmed the
conviction for attempting to perform an abortion, a criminal offense.
The defendant had agreed to perform an abortion upon a female undercover
police officer who was not, in fact, pregnant.

The Model Penal Code rejected the defense of "legal impossibility." See
MPC § 5.01(1) \[[Lexis
link](https://plus.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1530671&crid=de0eb8d9-0643-4798-a1cf-40214027a311&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes-legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A49GT-FF50-01S2-4059-00000-00&pdtocnodeidentifier=AACAAFAAB&ecomp=qy4hk&prid=deb1fd4f-fc5f-4004-bd3d-66a0b455f454)\].
Several states have adopted this policy by statute. See, e.g., Colo.
Rev. Stat. § 18-2-101(1) ("Factual or legal impossibility of committing
the offense is not a defense if the offense could have been committed
had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be,
nor is it a defense that the crime attempted was actually perpetrated by
the accused."); 720 Ill. Cons. Stat. § 5/8-4(b) ("It is not a defense to
a charge of attempt that because of a misapprehension of the
circumstances it would have been impossible for the accused to commit
the offense attempted."); Kans. Stat. § 21-5301(b) ("It shall not be a
defense to a charge of attempt that the circumstances under which the
act was performed or the means employed or the act itself were such that
the commission of the crime was not possible."); NY Penal Law § 110.10
("If the conduct in which a person engages otherwise constitutes an
attempt to commit a crime ..., it is no defense to a prosecution for
such attempt that the crime charged to have been attempted was, under
the attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of
commission, if such crime could have been committed had the attendant
circumstances been as such person believed them to be."). Others have
done so by judicial decision.

*Defining the criteria for attempt liability*: Clear, comprehensive
definitions of what constitutes sufficient conduct, in appropriate
circumstances, for attempt liability has proven challenging for both
courts and legislatures. In part this is because there can be several
reasons that attempted crimes are not completed.

-   In some cases, actors complete all the conduct required for the
    offense but some circumstance is missing that prevents the crime
    from being completed---this is the kind of scenario that
    "impossibility" rules address.

-   In other cases, actors complete all the conduct required for the
    offense, and all the necessary circumstances are present, but actor
    nonetheless fails to achieve some result that is required for the
    particular offense; think again of the attempted murder who fires a
    gun at his victim but through poor aim misses him.

-   In still other cases, the actor starts the conduct of committing the
    crime but then stops short before completing it; think of a would-be
    bank robber who abandons his plan upon entering the bank and seeing
    armed guards present.

State statutes define criteria for attempt liability with these distinct
scenarios in mind. Oklahoma Statute § 21-44, for example, speaks to the
first two scenarios:

A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the
kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:

\(a\) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if
the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or,

\(b\) when causing a particular result in an element of the crime, does
anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will
cause such result, without further conduct on his part.

Colorado law, by contrast, defines attempt liability only with the
regard to the third "incomplete attempt" scenario:

\(1\) A person commits criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of
culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he engages
in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the
offense. A substantial step is any conduct, whether act, omission, or
possession, which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the
actor\'s purpose to complete the commission of the offense.

Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-2-101. All three of these provisions are drawn
nearly verbatim from Model Penal Code § 5.01(1)(a)-(c). Oddly, however,
few if any state legislatures have adopted statutes based on the MPC
that address all three scenarios. (Surely, one can liable for attempted
crimes in all three scenarios in all states. But courts reach those
results with only the common law as a basis for those judgments.)

*The defense of abandonment/renunciation:* In incomplete-attempt
scenarios, one can readily imagine different reasons that actors abandon
their criminal plans, some more worthy than others. One actor might
abandon his effort when he realizes he is likely to get caught; another
might have a genuine change of heart and opt to do the right thing
before it's too late. Many states have laws that account for these
differences by providing an defense of "abandonment" or "renunciation"
for attempters who quit for the right reasons. See, e.g., Colo. Rev.
Stat. § 18-2-101(3) ("It is an affirmative defense to a charge under
this section that the defendant abandoned his effort to commit the crime
or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting
the complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal intent."); 18
Pa. Consol. Stat. § 901:

(c)  Renunciation.

(1)  In any prosecution for an attempt to commit a crime, it is a
defense that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant avoided the
commission of the crime attempted by abandoning his criminal effort and,
if the mere abandonment was insufficient to accomplish such avoidance,
by taking further and affirmative steps which prevented the commission
thereof.

(2)  A renunciation is not \"voluntary and complete\" within the meaning
of this subsection if it is motivated in whole or part by:

(i)  a belief that circumstances exist which increase the probability of
detection or apprehension of the defendant or another participant in the
criminal enterprise, or which render more difficult the accomplishment
of the criminal purpose; or

(ii)  a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until another time or
to transfer the criminal effort to another victim or another but similar
objective.

This Pennsylvania statute is closely modeled on MPC § 5.01(4).

 

 

 

8.2

Accomplice liability

 

 

 

 

Statutes on principals and accomplices

 

Some jurisdictions have adopted modern definitions of an accomplice.
This portion of the Pennsylvania statute is identical to Model Penal
Code § 2.06 (except as noted):

**Pa. Consol. Stat. § 306. Liability for Conduct of Another;
Complicity**.

1.  Accomplice defined. A person is an accomplice of another person in
    the commission of an offense if:

    -   with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of
        the offense, he:

(i)  solicits such other person to commit it; or

(ii)  aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or
committing it; or

\[*here the MPC adds:* "(iii) having a legal duty to prevent the
commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort so to do"\]

-   his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his
    complicity.

1.  Culpability of accomplice. When causing a particular result is an
    element of an offense, an accomplice in the conduct causing such
    result is an accomplice in the commission of that offense, if he
    acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that
    result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense.

 

Other jurisdictions retain common law terminology that distinguishes
among principals and accomplices:

**Va. Code § 18.2-18. How principals in second degree and accessories
before the fact punished.**

In the case of every felony, every principal in the second degree and
every accessory before the fact may be indicted, tried, convicted and
punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree ....

 

**Va. Code § 18.2-19. How accessories after the fact punished; certain
exceptions.**

Every accessory after the fact is guilty of (i) a Class 6 felony in the
case of a homicide offense that is punishable as a Class 1 or Class 2
felony or (ii) a Class 1 misdemeanor in the case of any other felony.
However, no person in the relation of spouse, parent or grandparent,
child or grandchild, or sibling, by consanguinity or affinity, or
servant to the offender, who, after the commission of a felony, aids or
assists a principal felon or accessory before the fact to avoid or
escape from prosecution or punishment, shall be deemed an accessory
after the fact.

\[Note how Virginia law makes a concession to human nature: one who
helps a family member's---or an employer's---effort to escape liability
is not deemed sufficiently blameworthy for criminal liability.\]

 

Still other jurisdictions have abolished distinct distinctions between
principals and accomplices:

**18 U.S.C. § 2. Principals**

\(a\) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids,
abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is
punishable as a principal.

\(b\) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly
performed by him or another would be an offense against the United
States, is punishable as a principal.

 

**18 U.S.C. § 3. Accessory after the fact**

Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been
committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order
to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an
accessory after the fact.

 

**Idaho Stat. § 18-204.  Principals defined**.

All persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether it be felony
or misdemeanor, and whether they directly commit the act constituting
the offense or aid and abet in its commission, or, not being present,
have advised and encouraged its commission, or who, by fraud,
contrivance, or force, occasion the intoxication of another for the
purpose of causing him to commit any crime, or who, by threats, menaces,
command or coercion, compel another to commit any crime, are principals
in any crime so committed.

 

 

 

State v. Gladstone, 78 Wash.2d 306, 474 P.2d 274 (1970)

 

HALE, Justice.

A jury found defendant Bruce Gladstone guilty of aiding and abetting one
Robert Kent in the unlawful sale of marijuana. ...

Gladstone's guilt as an aider and abettor in this case rests solely on
evidence of a conversation between him and one Douglas MacArthur
Thompson concerning the possible purchase of marijuana from one Robert
Kent. There is no other evidence to connect the accused with Kent who
ultimately sold some marijuana to Thompson. ...

\[Thompson, Kent and Gladstone were students at University of Puget
Sound. Tacoma Police recruited Thompson to buy marijuana from Gladstone.
Thompson went to Gladstone's home and asked to buy marijuana. Gladstone
replied that he did not have enough to sell but suggested that Kent did
have enough and would be willing to sell; he gave Thompson Kent's
address and drew a map to Kent's residence. Thompson subsequently bought
marijuana from Kent. There was no communication between Gladstone and
Kent.\]

If all reasonable inferences favorable to the state are accorded the
evidence, it does not, in our opinion, establish the commission of the
crime charged. That vital element---a nexus between the accused and the
party whom he is charged with aiding and abetting in the commission of a
crime---is missing. The record contains no evidence whatever that
Gladstone had any communication by word, gesture or sign, before or
after he drew the map, from which it could be inferred that he
counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced or procured Kent to
sell marijuana to Douglas Thompson as charged, or took any steps to
further the commission of the crime charged. He was not charged with
aiding and abetting Thompson in the purchase of marijuana, but with
Kent's sale of it. ...

\[E\]ven without prior agreement, arrangement or understanding, a
bystander to a robbery could be guilty of aiding and abetting its
commission if he came to the aid of a robber and knowingly assisted him
in perpetrating the crime. But regardless of the modus operandi and with
or without a conspiracy or agreement to commit the crime and whether
present or away from the scene of it, there is no aiding and abetting
unless one "in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he
participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he

which makes a principal of one who aids and abets another in the
commission of the crime. Although an aider and abettor need not be
physically present at the commission of the crime to be held guilty as a
principal, his conviction depends on proof that he did something in
association or connection with the principal to accomplish the crime.
Learned Hand, J., we think, hit the nail squarely when, in [United
States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir.
1938)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1939124664&pubNum=350&originatingDoc=Ie4ee93ddf7cc11d99439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_350_402&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)#co_pp_sp_350_402),
he wrote that, in order to aid and abet another to commit a crime, it is
necessary that a defendant "in some sort associate himself with the
venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to
bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed. All the
words used---even the most colorless, 'abet'---carry an implication of
purposive attitude towards it."

It would be a dangerous precedent indeed to hold that mere
communications to the effect that another might or probably would commit
a criminal offense amount to an aiding and abetting of the offense
should it ultimately be committed.

There being no evidence whatever that the defendant ever communicated to
Kent the idea that he would in any way aid him in the sale of any
marijuana, or said anything to Kent to encourage or induce him or direct
him to do so, or counseled Kent in the sale of marijuana, or did
anything more than describe Kent to another person as an individual who
might sell some marijuana, or would derive any benefit, consideration or
reward from such a sale, there was no proof of an aiding and abetting,
and the conviction should, therefore, be reversed as a matter of law.
Remanded with directions to dismiss.

HAMILTON, Justice (dissenting). ... I am satisfied that the jury was
fully warranted in concluding that appellant, when he affirmatively
recommended Kent as a source and purveyor of marijuana, entertained the
requisite conscious design and intent that his action would instigate,
induce, procure or encourage perpetration of Kent's subsequent crime of
selling marijuana to Thompson. ...

 

 

 

State ex rel. Martin, Atty. Gen., v. Tally, 102 Ala. 25, 15 So. 722
(1894)

 

McClellan, J.\
\[In an impeachment proceeding against Judge Tally of Scottsboro, the
court found that: one Ross had "seduced, or been criminally intimate
with," Tally's sister-in-law, the sister of Tally's wife and also of
three brothers, whose family name was Skelton. The Skelton brothers
followed Ross from Scottsville to nearby Stevenson. On his own
initiative, Tally went to the Scottboro telegraph office, where he
observed one of Ross's relatives sending a telegram to Ross warning him
of "four men on horseback with guns following. Look out." Tally then
sent his own telegram to the telegraph operator in Stevenson (a friend
of Tally's), telling the operator not to deliver the warning telegram.
The operator followed Tally's request and did not deliver the warning to
Ross. The Skelton brothers found Ross and killed him. The court
concluded that Tally was an accomplice to the homicide committed by the
Skeltons.\]\
We are therefore clear to the conclusion that, before Judge Tally can be
found guilty of aiding and abetting the Skeltons to kill Ross, it must
appear that his vigil at Scottsboro to prevent Ross from being warned of
his danger was by preconcert with them, or at least known to them,
whereby they would naturally be incited, encouraged, and emboldened --
"given confidence" -- to the deed, or that he aided them to kill Ross,
contributed to Ross' death, in point of physical fact, by means of the
telegram he sent to Huddleston \[the telegraph operator\]. \
The assistance given, however, need not contribute to the criminal
result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It
is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have
transpired without it. It is quite enough if the aid merely rendered it
easier for the principal actor to accomplish the end intended by him and
the aider and abettor, though in all human probability the end would
have been attained without it. If the aid in homicide can be shown to
have put the deceased at a disadvantage, to have deprived him of a
single chance of life which but for it he would have had, he who
furnishes such aid is guilty, though it cannot be known or shown that
the dead man, in the absence thereof, would have availed himself of that
chance; as, where one counsels murder, he is guilty as an accessory
before the fact, though it appears to be probable that murder would have
been done without his counsel; and as, where one being present by
concert to aid if necessary is guilty as a principal in the second
degree, though, had he been absent murder would have been committed, so,
where he who facilitates murder even by so much as destroying a single
chance of life the assailed might otherwise have had, he thereby
supplements the efforts of the perpetrator, and he is guilty as
principal in the second degree at common law, and is principal in the
first degree under our statute, notwithstanding it may be found that in
all human probability the chance would not have been availed of, and
death would have resulted anyway.

 

 

 

State v. McVay, 47 R.I. 292 (1926)

 

Barrows, J.

Heard on a certification of a question of law before trial. Three
indictments for manslaughter, each containing four counts, were brought
against the captain and engineer of the steamer Mackinac, as principals,
and against Kelley, as accessory before the fact. The steamer carried
several hundred passengers from Pawtucket to Newport via Narragansett
Bay. The boiler producing the steam by which the vessel was propelled
burst near Newport and many lives were lost. The present indictments are
for causing the deaths of three persons killed by escaping steam after
the explosion of the boiler. ...

The same question is raised upon each indictment. That question is:

May a defendant be indicted and convicted of being an accessory before
the fact to the crime of manslaughter arising through criminal
negligence as set forth in the indictment?

... The charge against Kelley as accessory is that "before said felony
and manslaughter was committed," he did, at Pawtucket, "feloniously and
maliciously aid, assist, abet, counsel, hire, command and procure the
said George W. McVay and John A. Grant, the said felony and manslaughter
in manner and form aforesaid to do and commit." ...

Because the manslaughter charge is "without malice" and "involuntary,"
Kelley contends that he cannot be indicted legally as an accessory
before the fact. The argument is that manslaughter, being a sudden and
unpremeditated crime, inadvertent and unintentional by its very nature,
cannot be "maliciously" incited before the crime is committed. ...

While every one must agree that there can be no accessory before the
fact when a killing results from a sudden and unpremeditated blow, we do
not think it can be broadly stated that premeditation is inconsistent
with every charge of manslaughter. Manslaughter may consist, among other
things, of doing an unlawful act resulting in unintentional killing,
such as violation of motor vehicle laws or administration of drugs to
procure an abortion. Manslaughter is likewise committed if an
unintentional killing is occasioned by gross negligence in the doing of
an act lawful in itself. There is no inherent reason why, prior to the
commission of such a crime, one may not aid, abet, counsel, command, or
procure the doing of the unlawful act or of the lawful act in a
negligent manner. A premeditated act may be involved in such unlawful
homicides. ...

... \[T\]he present indictment for involuntary manslaughter is not
self--contradictory when it charges Kelley to be an accessory before the
fact. It was possible for him at Pawtucket to intentionally direct and
counsel the grossly negligent act which the indictment charges resulted
in the crime. Involuntary manslaughter ... means that defendants
exercised no conscious volition to take life, but their negligence was
of such a character that criminal intention can be presumed. 29 C. J.
1154. The crime was consummated when the explosion occurred. The
volition of the principals was exercised when they chose negligently to
create steam which the boiler could not carry. The doing of the act
charged or failure to perform the duty charged was voluntary and
intentional in the sense that defendants exercised a choice among
courses of conduct. It is obvious that Kelley could participate and is
charged with participating in procuring defendants to act in a grossly
negligent manner prior to the explosion. ... Specific duties are stated
to have been laid upon the captain and engineer. Defendant is charged
with full knowledge of those duties and of the fact that the boiler was
unsafe. He is charged with counseling and procuring the principals at
Pawtucket to disregard their duties and negligently create steam. ...
\[A\] jury might find that defendant Kelley, with full knowledge of the
possible danger to human life, recklessly and willfully advised,
counseled, and commanded the captain and engineer to take a chance by
negligent action or failure to act. ...

 

 

 

Commonwealth v. Roebuck, 32 A.3d 613 (Pa. 2011)

 

Justice Saylor.

In this appeal, we consider whether it is possible, as a matter of law,
to be convicted as an accomplice to third-degree murder.

 The ... victim was lured to an apartment complex, where he was
ambushed, shot, and mortally wounded. Appellant participated, with
others, in orchestrating the events, but he did not shoot the victim.

 Appellant was charged with ... murder of the third degree. 18 Pa.C.S. §
2502(c). \[T\]he Commonwealth relied upon accomplice theory, codified in
Section 306 of the Crimes Code along with other complicity-based
accountability principles. The matter proceeded to a bench trial, and a
verdict of guilt ensued.

 On appeal, Appellant argued that there is no rational legal theory to
support accomplice liability for third-degree murder. He rested his
position on the following syllogism: accomplice liability attaches only
where the defendant *intends* to facilitate or promote an underlying
offense; third-degree murder is an *unintentional* killing committed
with malice; therefore, to adjudge a criminal defendant guilty of
third-degree murder as an accomplice would be to accept that the accused
*intended* to aid an *unintentional* act, which is a logical
impossibility.

 The Superior Court ... highlighted the following statutory prescription
pertaining to the requisite *mens rea* (or mental state) \[and which
tracks MPC § 2.06(4)\]:

When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an
accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the
commission of that offense, if he acts with the kind of culpability, if
any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission
of the offense.

\[189 Pa. C.S.\]  § 306(d). 

As the "kind of culpability" predicate to third-degree murder entails
malice, ... the court reasoned that, "\[i\]f one participates in a
criminal act, which also demonstrates malice, and if a life is taken,
one can be convicted of \... third-degree murder vicariously." ... In
effect, the intermediate court held that complicity theory applies in
third-degree murder scenarios---even if homicide was not the intended
underlying crime---where the intentional acts demonstrate a disregard
for human life amounting to malice. \[The Superior Court concluded "that
Appellant demonstrated the requisite malice by participating in a scheme
designed, at a minimum, to stage an armed confrontation with the
victim," because under Pennsylvania case law, "malice is present under
circumstances where a defendant did not have an intent to kill, but
nevertheless displayed a conscious disregard for 'an unjustified and
extremely high risk that his actions might cause death or serious bodily
harm.'"\] ...

 This discretionary appeal was allowed to resolve Appellant's legal
challenge to the application of complicity theory to murder of the third
degree....

In reply and in relevant part, the Commonwealth posits that accomplice
liability readily pertains to murder of the third degree \[because\] it
is the shared criminal intent motivating the underlying conduct (here,
designing to stage a very dangerous altercation) which establishes the
requisite criminal culpability. ... According to the Commonwealth, it is
both rational and sensible to hold one who aids another in malicious
conduct to account to the same degree as the principal for foreseeable
consequences of the wrongful actions. *...*

 At the outset, it certainly is possible for a state legislature to
employ complicity theory to establish legal accountability on the part
of an accomplice for foreseeable but unintended results caused by a
principal. Indeed, this was the express design of the American Law
Institute's widely influential Model Penal Code.

 To provide appropriate context in considering the MPC's treatment of
complicity theory, it is helpful to review some of the Code's core
theoretical underpinnings. Also impacting on this discussion, the MPC
does not employ the term "malice" in its treatment of the crime of
murder, but rather, expresses the concept as "reckless\[ness\] under
circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human
life." ...

In addressing the terms of the Model Penal Code, it is important to bear
in mind that the Code employs an elements approach to substantive
criminal law, which recognizes that a single offense definition may
require different culpable mental states for each objective offense
element. *...*

 Conceptually, the MPC also recognizes three objective categories of
offense elements---conduct, attendant circumstances, and result. *See*
[MPC §
2.02](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS2.02&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)).
The Code frequently distinguishes among these offense-element categories
in its various prescriptions regarding which of the four levels of
culpability must be established for any given offense element....

The legal accountability of accomplices for the conduct of others is
treated in 2.06 of the Code. \[The key MPC provisions are MPC § 2.06(3)
and (4)\]:

\(3\) A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of
an offense if \... with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the
commission of the offense, he \... aids or agrees or attempts to aid
such other person in planning or committing it\[.\]

\(4\) When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an
accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the
commission of that offense if he acts with the kind of culpability, if
any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission
of the offense.

Section 206(4) thus prescribes that an accomplice may be held legally
accountable where he is an "accomplice in the conduct"---or, in other
words, aids another in planning or committing the conduct with the
purpose of promoting or facilitating it---and acts with recklessness
(*i.e.,* the "kind of culpability \... sufficient for the commission of"
a reckless-result offense).

 \[MPC\] commentary explains that the term "commission of the offense,"
as used in [Section
2.06(3)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS2.06&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)#co_pp_d08f0000f5f67),
focuses on the *conduct,* not the result. *See id.* § 2.06, cmt. 6(b),
at 310 ... This diffuses any impression that an accomplice must always
intend results essential to the completed crime. *...* The commentary
then points to the fourth subsection as supplying the essential
culpability requirement, as follows:

One who solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is
an accomplice in whatever means may be employed, insofar as they
constitute or commit an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the
association. But *when a wholly different crime has been committed, thus
involving conduct not within the conscious objectives of the accomplice,
he is not liable for it unless the case falls within the specific terms
of Subsection (4).*

[MPC §
2.06](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS2.06&originatingDoc=I106f9392160911e1a4dda8d3ae9c068b&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)),
cmt. 6(b), at 311 (emphasis added). According to the commentary, the
purport of the fourth subsection is to hold the accomplice accountable
for contributing to the conduct to the degree his culpability equals
what is required to support liability of a principal actor. ...

In summary, a conviction for murder of the third degree is supportable
under complicity theory where the Commonwealth proves the accomplice
acted with the culpable mental state required of a principal actor,
namely, malice.... The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed ....

Justice Eakin, concurring: ... As Appellant's syllogism is based on a
false premise, his argument fails. Indeed, an accomplice to third degree
murder does not intend to aid an unintentional murder; he intends to aid
a malicious act which results in a killing. Suppose an accomplice hands
a gun to the principal and says "shoot that victim---I don't care if he
dies or not, but shoot him." The principal shoots the victim in the leg,
but the victim dies---it is classic third degree murder, there being no
proof of specific intent to kill, but a clearly malicious act regardless
of the consequences. The same logic that enables a murder charge against
the principal binds the accomplice as well---both committed an
intentional malicious act that resulted in the death of another, and
both are guilty of the murder charge that follows. Accordingly, I
respectfully concur in result.

Conspiracy

 

Roughly put, conspiracy is the crime of agreeing with another to commit
a crime; the act of agreement is the core of the offense. Some statutes
require also that one of the conspirators do some (perhaps minimal and
legal) \"over act\" toward accomplishing the substantive offense; others
do not. Under federal law and the law of some states (but not all, and
not under the law of England or other common law countries), a defendant
can be convicted for both conspiracy to commit an offense and\--if
completed\--also the substantive offense itself. In Pinkerton v. United
States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), the Supreme Court affirmed the convictions
of petitioners who were convicted of a conspiracy to violate the
Internal Revenue Code and of several substantive violations of the Code
and were sentenced both for the conspiracy and for the substantive
offenses. *Pinkerton* has two key holdings: (1) Where an indictment
charges both a conspiracy to engage in a course of criminal conduct and
a series of substantive offenses committed pursuant to the conspiracy,
the substantive offenses are not merged into the conspiracy. Upon
conviction, the accused may be punished both for the conspiracy and for
the substantive offenses. (2) Additionally, a party to a continuing
conspiracy may be responsible for substantive offenses committed by a
co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, even though he does not
participate in the substantive offenses or have any knowledge of them.

 

 

 

 

18 U.S.C. § 371 Conspiracy

 

If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the
United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in
any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any
act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under
this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

*Case law under section 371*: The standard understanding of Section 371
is that the statute requires that (1) at least two people entered into
an agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the government (2) by
deceitful or dishonest means, and (3) that amember of the conspiracy
engaged in at least one overt act in furtherance of the agreement. See

like means any officer of the United States to leave the place, where
his duties as an officer are required to be performed, or to injure him
in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the
duties of his office, or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof,

secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or
because of his having so exercised the same ... \[t\]hey shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both....

*Case law under section 241:* Among the constitutional rights protected
by section 241 is the right to vote. Courts have affirmed that section
241 reach conspiracies to infringe the right to vote in a variety of
ways:

-   conspiracies to interfere---by violence, intimidation, or
    otherwise---with an individual's right to cast a ballot, Ex parte
    Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 (1884);

-   conspiracy among county election officials to omit returns from
    certain precincts from the returns they forward to the state
    election board, United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383 (1915);

-   conspiracy among local election officials conducting primary
    election under state law to alter, falsely count, and falsely
    certify ballots of voters cast in such election, United States v.
    Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941);

-   conspiracy to stuff ballot boxes with fraudulent votes, thereby
    diluting value of votes of qualified voters, Anderson v. United
    States, 417 U.S. 211 (1974); United States v Saylor, 322 U.S. 385

21 U.S.C. § 846 Drug crime conspiracy

 

Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in
this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those
prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of
the attempt or conspiracy.

*Case law under section 846*: Note that, unlike section 371, 21 U.S.C. §
846 does not require an \"overt act\" by any member of the conspiracy.
It also does not define \"conspires.\" Judicial interpretations of
section 846 make clear that that the prosecution must prove an agreement
existed between the defendant and one or more other persons "for the
purpose of committing, by their joint efforts, a criminal act." United
States v. Campbell, 985 F.2d 341, 344 (7th Cir. 1993). There must be
evidence of a "participatory link" between the conspiracy and the
defendant, United States v. Navarez, p. 561954 F.2d 1375, 1380-81 (7th
Cir. 1992), proving that the defendant knew of the conspiracy and
intended to join its criminal purpose. But section 846 does *not*
require evidence of an overt act by the defendant or another
conspirator; proving the \"link\" is merely a means to prove that a
defendant joined the conspiratorial agreement. See United States v.
Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 15 (1994).

 

 

 

United States v. Colon

 

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit

549 F.3d 565 (7^th^ Cir. 2008)

 

POSNER, *Circuit Judge*.

The defendant was convicted by a jury of possessing cocaine with intent
to sell it, conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to sell it, and
aiding and abetting the conspiracy, and he was sentenced to 135 months
in prison. The principal ground of his appeal is that he was not a
conspirator or an aider and abettor of a conspiracy, but was merely a
purchaser from a conspirator, and that the jury's contrary finding
lacked sufficient basis in the evidence to stand....

The government was listening to the phone conversations of the
defendant's supplier, Saucedo, and heard him tell Rodriguez (Saucedo's
admitted co-conspirator) that "Dude" would be coming to a particular
house in 15 minutes to pick up drugs that "Dude" had ordered. Sure
enough, 15 minutes later, officers staking out the house saw a man enter
it and emerge shortly afterwards, and they tried to stop him and after a
chase caught him and found the cocaine he had just bought. The man was
Colon. The cocaine was introduced into evidence against him at the
trial....

The evidence of his guilt of these offenses, as summarized in the
government's brief, is that the "defendant regularly obtained
distribution quantities of cocaine from Saucedo and Rodriguez. . . . The
dealings between . . . \[the defendant and Saucedo, with whom alone the
defendant dealt\] were standardized and exhibited mutual trust. Saucedo
and Rodriguez had a stake in defendant's distribution activities as well
as their ongoing arrangement, given that their profits depended on the
success of defendant's distribution efforts.... \[The defendant and
Saucedo\] conducted regular, standardized transactions through which
defendant obtained cocaine in quantities of either 4.5 or 9 ounces at
consistent prices, and distributed it to customers. Defendant and
Saucedo regularly arranged deliveries by telephone," with defendant
being the caller, using Saucedo's cellphone number.

The government's summary describes a routine buyer-seller relationship,
as in *United States v. Mercer*, 165 F.3d 1331, 1336 (11th Cir. 1999),
where the court remarked that "the evidence shows simply that his
co-defendant Miller knew that Mercer sold drugs and that he had sources
from which he could get drugs, that Mercer had a source for drugs and if
that source failed he would 'go somewhere else,' that he bought
quantities of cocaine from some unknown source and sold it to police
agents presumably at a profit." The relationship in the present case was
"standardized" only in the sense that because seller and buyer dealt
regularly with each other, the sales formed a regular pattern, as one
would expect in any repeat purchase, legal or illegal. The length of the
sales relationship is unclear; it may have been as long as six weeks,
but the total number of sales was no more than six or seven, involving a
total of 30 to 35 ounces of cocaine.

In any event, how "regular" purchases on "standard" terms can transform
a customer into a co-conspirator mystifies us. "\[A\]greement---the
crime of conspiracy--- cannot be equated with repeated transactions."
*United States v. Thomas*, 150 F.3d 743, 745 (7th Cir. 1998). The
government either is confusing buying with conspiring or believes that a
seller and buyer who fail to wrangle over each sale aren't dealing at
arms' length and therefore lack mutual trust. But "mutual trust" is
already a factor in the conventional analysis of conspiracy; an act that
is merely evidence of mutual trust cannot be a separate factor. And
anyway repeat transactions need not imply greater mutual trust than is
required in any buyer-seller relationship. If you buy from Wal-Mart your
transactions will be highly regular and utterly standardized, but there
will be no mutual trust suggestive of a relationship other than that of
buyer and seller.

It is different if, as in *United States. v. Sax*, 39 F.3d 1380, 1385-86
(7th Cir. 1994), a seller assists his customers in establishing the
methods by which they will take delivery from him, for then he is more
than just a seller; he is helping to create a distribution system for
his illegal product. But the defendant in our case (a buyer, not a
seller) did nothing to help Saucedo and Rodriguez establish a delivery
system that would enable them to serve him, or serve him better.

The fact that in his conversations with Rodriguez, Saucedo referred to
Colon as "Dude" or "Old Boy," rather than calling him by his name, is
not, as the government believes, indicative of intimacy or a
pre-existing relationship; it is for obvious reasons a convention in the
drug trade not to refer to a customer by his real name. There were no
sales on credit to the defendant, or other evidence of mutual trust or
dependence, and he had no dealings with---indeed, he never met or spoke
to---Rodriguez, Saucedo's unquestioned co-conspirator, although the
defendant knew that they worked together. There is no suggestion that
the defendant could expect to receive any part of the income that
Saucedo obtained from selling cocaine to other customers. There was no
"stimulation, instigation," or "encouragement" by the defendant of
Saucedo and Rodriguez's business, *Direct Sales Co. v. United States*,
319 U.S. 703, 713, 63 S. Ct. 1265, 87 L. Ed. 1674 (1943), no "informed
and interested cooperation" between that business and the defendant's
retail drug business. *Id*. In his conversations with Rodriguez, Saucedo
referred to the defendant only as a "customer," not as an associate,
colleague, pal, or "one of us." The prosecutor in closing argument
described the defendant as the conspirators' customer, and its own
witnesses denied that Saucedo had ever asked the defendant to sell
cocaine for him or Rodriguez.

Of course, Saucedo and Rodriguez had, as the government says, "a stake
in defendant's distribution activities." Every seller to a distributor
has a stake in the distributor's activities; a person who buys for
resale will not enrich his seller if his resale business dries up.
Saucedo and Rodriguez had other customers; we do not know how many, or
what the defendant's volume of purchases was relative to that of other
customers.

Cases in this and other circuits list factors such as we have discussed,
along with others, as indicative of participation in a conspiracy. But
in every case such factors have to be placed in context before an
inference of participation in a conspiracy can be drawn. See *United
States v. Moran*, 984 F.2d 1299, 1302-03 (1st Cir. 1993). In *United
States v. Hicks*, 368 F.3d 801, 805 (7th Cir. 2004), for example, we
listed a number of these factors but added "prolonged cooperation"
between the parties (a quotation from *Direct Sales Co. v. United
States, supra*, 319 U.S. at 713, the Supreme Court's leading case on the
difference between a conspiracy and a mere buyer-seller relationship)
and "sales on credit," factors that strengthen an inference of
participation drawn from observing circumstances also found in a routine
buyer-seller relationship. See also *United States v. Hawkins*, 547 F.3d
66 (2d Cir. 2008).

So the government's theory of conspiracy, when stripped of its
redundancies and irrelevancies, reduces to an assertion that a wholesale
customer of a conspiracy is a coconspirator per se. The implication is
that during Prohibition a speakeasy was a co-conspirator of the smuggler
who provided it with its supply of booze. And the logic of the
government's position does not stop with the customer who is a wholesale
purchaser rather than a retail one. Had the defendant been purchasing
for his personal consumption, he would still have had "regular,
standardized" transactions with Saucedo, as in our Wal-Mart example, and
Saucedo would have had a stake in whatever activity the defendant
engaged in to obtain the money to buy cocaine. There would have been the
same level of "mutual trust" as required in any illegal sale because
either buyer or seller might be a government informant or turn violent.
The mutual trust in this case was less than it would have been had
Saucedo "fronted" cocaine to the defendant (a factor mentioned in almost
all the cases) rather than being paid in cash at the time of sale. With
fronting, the seller becomes the buyer's creditor, adding a dimension to
the relationship that goes beyond a spot sale for cash.

There are practical reasons for not conflating sale with conspiracy. "A
sale, by definition, requires two parties; their combination for that
limited purpose does not increase the likelihood that the sale will take
place, so conspiracy liability would be inappropriate." *United States
v. Townsend*, 924 F.2d 1385, 1394 (7th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). As
we put it in *United States v. Manzella*, 791 F.2d 1263, 1265 (7th Cir.
1986), "A conspiracy involves more people and can therefore commit more
crimes; and it can do so more efficiently, by exploiting the division of
labor and by arranging concealment more effectively---sometimes through
suborning law enforcers." There is nothing like that here, so far as the
defendant's involvement was concerned. And the situation is not altered
just because he was a buyer for resale rather than for his personal
consumption. As the plurality opinion in *United States v. Lechuga*, 994
F.2d 346 (7th Cir. 1993) (en banc), explains, "before today, it was
widely assumed that a conviction for participation in a drug conspiracy
could be affirmed with no more evidence than that the defendant had sold
in a quantity too large to be intended for his buyer's personal
consumption, though some of our cases . . . tugged the other way. Today
we resolve the conflict in our cases by holding that 'large quantities
of controlled substances, without more, cannot sustain a conspiracy
conviction.' What is necessary and sufficient is proof of an agreement
to commit a crime other than the crime that consists of the sale
itself." *Id*. at 347 (citations omitted)....

This would be a different case, therefore, had the defendant agreed to
look for other customers for Saucedo and Rodriguez, had received a
commission on sales to those customers, had advised Saucedo and
Rodriguez on the conduct of their business, or had agreed to warn them
of threats to their business from competing dealers or from
law-enforcement authorities. It would be a different case if "Lechuga
\[the seller\] had told Pinto \[the buyer\] that he needed a good
distributor on the south side of Chicago and wanted to enter into a
long-term relationship with Pinto to that end. Then it would be as if
Lechuga had hired Pinto to assist him in reaching his market." *United
States v. Lechuga, supra*, 994 F.2d at 349.

All these would be settings in which ... Saucedo, Rodriguez, and the
defendant would have had "the same joint criminal objective . . . of
distributing drugs." \[*United States v. Dekle*,\] 165 F.3d 826, 829
\[11th Cir. 1999\].... But in our case there is no evidence of a
relationship other than a conventional sales relationship between the
defendant and the conspiracy from which he bought drugs. It is true that
after discarding, in his flight from the police, the cocaine he had just
bought from Saucedo, the defendant called Saucedo and told him what had
happened. But there is no suggestion that he was warning Saucedo, in
order to help the latter evade capture, rather than merely reporting an
incident that might affect the defendant's future purchases. A drug
runner employed by Saucedo phoned the defendant and told him he'd been
stopped by the police after delivering cocaine to him, but that is not
evidence of the defendant's participation in a conspiracy either.

The muddle that was the government's theory of the case was mirrored in
the jury instructions, which after correctly noting that the defendant's
purchase of drugs from another person for resale was insufficient
evidence that the defendant had conspired with that person, told the
jury to consider whether "the parties had an understanding that the
cocaine would be sold" and whether "the transaction involved large
quantities of cocaine." If the defendant was a middleman, as he was, the
parties would understand that he would be reselling the cocaine; and as
a middleman he would be likely to buy in quantities greater than one
would buy for one's personal consumption, and therefore "large." The
jury was also asked to consider whether the parties had "a standardized
way of doing business over time," whether they had "a continuing
relationship," "whether the sales were on credit or on consignment," and
whether the seller had a "financial steak \[*sic*\] in a resale by the
buyer." Only the question about credit or consignment was germane, for
reasons that we've indicated, and that question could only have confused
the jury, since all the transactions with the defendant were cash
transactions. And the judge made no effort to relate the factors that
she told the jury to consider to the difference between a customer and a
conspirator. It is no surprise that the jury convicted; given the warped
instructions, the conviction does nothing to advance the government's
argument that the evidence of conspiracy was sufficient for a reasonable
jury to convict.

Nor was the defendant proved to be an aider or abettor of the
Saucedo-Rodriguez conspiracy. An aider and abettor is conventionally
defined as one who knowingly assists an illegal activity, wanting it to
succeed. E.g., *United States v. Pino-Perez*, 870 F.2d 1230, 1235 (7th
Cir. 1989) (en banc); ... *United States v. Peoni*, 100 F.2d 401, 402
(2d Cir. 1938) (L. Hand, J.). This is a general definition, however, and
like most legal generalizations requires qualification in particular
cases. Suppose you own and operate a store that sells women's clothing.
Every month the same young woman buys a red dress from your store. You
happen to know that she's a prostitute and wears the dress to signal her
occupation to prospective customers. By selling her the dress at your
normal price you assist her illegal activity, and probably you want the
activity to succeed since if it fails she'll stop buying the dress and
your income will be less. But you are not an aider and abettor of
prostitution because if you refused to sell to her she would buy her red
dress from another clothing store, one whose proprietor and staff didn't
know her profession. *United States v. Zafiro*, 945 F.2d 881, 887 (7th
Cir. 1991), affirmed on other grounds, 506 U.S. 534 (1993); see also
*United States v. Falcone*, 109 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir. 1940) (L. Hand,
J.). So you're not *really* helping her or promoting prostitution, as
you would be if you recommended customers to her in exchange for a
commission.

It is the same here, so far as the record reveals. By buying from
Saucedo, the defendant was assisting an illegal activity, which he
doubtless wanted to be successful as otherwise he would have to find
another seller. If that is enough to establish aiding and abetting,
every buyer from a drug conspiracy is an aider and abettor of a
conspiracy and is therefore to be treated by the law exactly as a member
of the conspiracy would be treated. 18 U.S.C. § 2(a). Yet as with the
sale of the red dress, there is no basis for thinking that the defendant
really helped Saucedo and Rodriguez's drug conspiracy---that he made a
difference---because so far as appears they could have found another
customer for the modest amount of cocaine that they sold to him.

The government relies on *United States v. Kasvin*, 757 F.2d 887 (7th
Cir. 1985), but omits mention of the part of the opinion that shows how
different that case is from this one. Kasvin, the buyer defendant, "for
several years . . . had visited the headquarters of the conspiracy
several times weekly, had been assigned a number just as some of the
admitted members of the conspiracy had been assigned, his telephone
number had been encoded, on occasion he provided the organization with
marijuana for use in its business, his transactions with the conspiracy
ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars annually but unlike an
ordinary customer of a business, he simply picked up quantities of
marijuana from headquarters, presumably disposed of it through a
distribution network, and brought the money back from time to time in
amounts which, so far as the records show, bore no definite relationship
to the amounts of marijuana carried away at any particular time." *Id*.
at 891. There is nothing like that here....

Even the government has its doubts whether the defendant was a member or
an aider and abettor of the Saucedo-Rodriguez conspiracy. A conspirator
is liable for the foreseeable crimes that his co-conspirators commit in
furtherance of the conspiracy, *Pinkerton v. United States*, 328 U.S.
640, 646-47 (1946); *United States v. Hach*, 162 F.3d 937, 951 (7th Cir.
1998), yet the only drug quantity on which the government sought to base
the defendant's sentence was the quantity that Saucedo sold him, though
he knew that Saucedo and Rodriguez were selling cocaine to others as
well as to him. One is led to wonder why the government added charges of
conspiracy and of aiding and abetting to the charge of possession with
intent to distribute. The guideline ranges were the same and the
additional charges were likely to confuse the jury by making the
defendant's conduct seem more ominous than it was....

So probably the additional charges added nothing to the charge of
possession with intent to distribute. But maybe the government was
concerned that in the (unlikely) event that the evidence obtained when
the defendant was caught at Saucedo's house was suppressed, the jury
might acquit the defendant of possession or the sentence for possession
might be based on a smaller quantity of cocaine and therefore be
shorter.

Since the defendant was given concurrent sentences on the two counts, it
may seem that reversing the conspiracy and aiding and abetting count
could not alter his sentence. But the district judge sentenced him very
near the top of the applicable guideline range, and in doing so may have
been influenced by the fact that the jury had found the defendant guilty
of conspiracy and aiding and abetting as well as of possession. *Yates
v. United States*, 355 U.S. 66, 75-76 (1957); *United States v.
Manzella, supra*, 791 F.2d at 1270; .... So while the defendant's
conviction of possession stands, he is entitled to be acquitted on the
other count and he must therefore be resentenced.

Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded with directions.

 

 

 

United States v. Hunte

 

\[Recall the *Hunte* decision from our earlier study of drug possession.
In this excerpt from the same opinion, the court affirms Hunte\'s
conviction on a conspiracy charge. Review the facts of Hunte\'s case and
compare her conduct, motive and circumstances to Colon\'s. Are the
convictions consistent? Does it make sense why Hunte is convicted of
conspiracy and Colon is not?\]

Kanne, *Circuit Judge.* ... Conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846 requires
that the Government establish the existence of an agreement between two
or more persons \"for the purpose of committing, by their joint efforts,
a criminal act.\" *United States v. Campbell,* 985 F.2d 341, 344 (7th
Cir. 1993). The Government must show a \"participatory link\" between
the conspiracy and the defendant. *United States v. Navarez,* 954 F.2d
1375, 1380-81 (7th Cir. 1992). That link must be established by
sufficient evidence demonstrating that the defendant knew of the
conspiracy and intended to join its criminal purpose. *Id.* However,
unlike liability for attempt, conspiracy liability does not require
evidence of an overt act by the defendant, *see United States v.
Shabani,* 513 U.S. 10, 15 (1994); *United States v. Pulido,* 69 F.3d
192, 208-09 (7th Cir. 1995), and the phrase \"participatory link\"
should not be confused in that way. Rather, the link simply provides a
way to show that the defendant joined the conspiratorial agreement.

The evidence of Hunte\'s involvement in the conspiracy is slight. She
appeared to have no role in planning the trip or securing any of the
things necessary for its completion, such as the vehicles, cash or
cohorts. She seemed to have no express understanding with Richards as to
her involvement in the plan or share of the proceeds. She had no express
responsibilities, did not negotiate the drug transaction and apparently
was not needed to handle, weigh or transport the drugs.

However, the jury may consider \"overt acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy as circumstantial evidence establishing knowing participation
in a conspiracy.\" *United States v. Burrell,* 963 F.2d 976, 988 (7th
Cir. 1992). The evidence shows that Hunte knew of the conspiracy\'s
existence, as she spent several days traveling from New York to Arizona
where the group picked up a large load of marijuana, sampled it, hid it
in the minivan and returned toward New York. The question is whether she
intended to join its criminal purpose, and the bare overt acts committed
in furtherance of the conspiracy establish that intent. For instance, a
jury could find a participatory link between Hunte and the conspiracy
from Hunte\'s closing the window blinds to hide their activities from
view, helping to roll a joint for sampling, registering for the hotel
room where the group rested, driving one of the vehicles used for
transportation of the co-conspirators and lying to police about their
destination and about their association with Warwick and Gonzalez. The
fact that she did not expect to share directly in the proceeds of the
crime does not defeat a finding of knowing participation. A criminal
without a profit motive is still a criminal as long as all elements of
the crime are established....

We find that the evidence supports the defendant\'s conviction for
conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute narcotics and affirm
her convictions.... 

 

 

 

United States v. Partida

 

United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

385 F.3d 546 (5^th^ Cir. 2004)

CARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge:

This public integrity action involves an undercover reverse sting
operation devised by government agents to snare two former corrupt city
police officers. Appellants Marco Abel Partida and Gerardo Vigil, on
separate occasions, assisted in the transportation of what they believed
to be sizeable marijuana shipments through Donna, Texas. Following a
jury trial, Partida and Vigil were convicted of various crimes in
connection with their drug trafficking participation.... For the reasons
that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Beginning in 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an
investigation into allegations of criminal activity within the Donna
Police Department of Donna, Texas. The government's investigation
focused on two former police officers, acting chief of police Partida
and patrol officer Vigil, after receiving information that those
officers provided protection for drug shipments through their patrol
districts in exchange for money. The story of how these two former
police officers went astray began with the revelation of a long-term
friendship between Partida and reputed drug dealer, turned government
informant, Rigoberto Quintanilla.

In the spring of 1999, FBI agents learned that Partida and Quintanilla
had close ties. While Partida was a sheriff's officer in Hidalgo County,
Texas, Quintanilla served as a former sheriff's deputy in Hidalgo
County. FBI agents also learned that law enforcement officer Partida and
South Texas drug dealer Quintanilla pursued trips to Atlanta, Georgia
together. Additionally, Government agents discovered that Partida and
Quintanilla had been friends for years, and at one time, the two men
were even roommates.

In July 1999, FBI agents interviewed Partida at the Hidalgo County
Sheriff's Office. Partida \[confessed to various drug interactions with
Quintanilla\]. Shortly after the interview, Partida resigned from the
sheriff's office and was hired as a patrol officer with the local police
department in the City of Donna, Texas.

In April of 1999, Quintanilla was identified by the government in
connection with the transportation of about 6,000 pounds of marijuana,
which was seized at the Border Patrol checkpoint in Falfurrias, Texas.
Following his arrest, Quintanilla became a confidential source for the
government, and provided FBI agents with information about a number of
individuals. Quintanilla also informed government agents that he knew a
patrol officer with the Donna Police Department, who turned out to be
Partida, interested in assisting the transportation of marijuana....

With Quintanilla's consent, FBI agents commenced a reverse sting
operation centered around Quintanilla, posing as a drug dealer, driving
an empty vehicle which Partida was told would be carrying marijuana
loads through Donna. Quintanilla would arrange for Partida, while on
duty as a Donna police officer, to escort the load vehicle in a marked
patrol vehicle to a destination outside the Donna city limits. Once the
load vehicle reached the city limits, the patrol car would turn around,
and the load vehicle would continue on. At a later point in time,
Quintanilla would arrange a location to meet up with Partida and perform
payment for the services rendered.

Pursuant to this operation, FBI agents began recording a series of
meetings and conversations between Quintanilla and Partida, in which
Partida pledged to assist in escorting bulks of marijuana through the
city of Donna. In one recorded telephone conversation, Quintanilla and
Partida spoke about how Quintanilla would be passing through the area
with 300 pounds of marijuana in a red Suburban with tinted windows at
"exactly uno." Partida replied, "OK. I'm going to be there."

In a recorded conversation on April 20, 2001, a staged event was
arranged for Partida to follow a red Suburban through Donna while
Partida was under the belief that he would be protecting the transport
of 300 pounds of marijuana. Unbeknown to Partida, the Suburban actually
contained no marijuana inside. Government agents provided Quintanilla
with the Suburban (which had a video camera specially installed), and
instructed Quintanilla to drive from McAllen to a location near the
Donna city limits. Once Quintanilla arrived at the location near Donna,
FBI agents switched on the camera. As the staged event unfolded,
undercover FBI agents videotaped Partida's marked patrol vehicle "bumper
locked" to the Suburban for two and a half miles as the Suburban, driven
by Quintanilla, slowly drove through the city limit of Donna. Five days
later, the two men met at Quintanilla's house, and in a recorded
encounter Quintanilla paid Partida \$ 500 for his assistance. As he took
the money, Partida commented, "I'm in the wrong business.... That
\[was\] the easiest money I ever made. Let's do it again."

As circumstances would have it, another ill-fated opportunity arose for
Partida to participate in drug trafficking. In May 2001, Quintanilla
informed Partida of another "load coming through again." After learning
of the time frame for the shipment, Partida responded "I'm there, Dude."
Quintanilla and Partida discussed whether another Donna police officer
was also willing to escort Quintanilla through the city. Government
agents instructed Quintanilla to ask about this subject because by this
time Partida had risen to the rank of acting chief of police. Partida's
ascendance caused a problem because he no longer drove a marked patrol
car. Quintanilla insisted that he needed a marked patrol car to follow
the drug shipment in order to limit the risk of "getting the load ripped
off" by a rival trafficking organization. Partida had someone in mind,
and he discussed with Quintanilla how much Quintanilla would pay Partida
and the other officer.

The person Partida had in mind was Donna police officer Vigil. After
several phone calls between Quintanilla and Partida, a meeting was
finally arranged. On November 7, 2001, Partida and Vigil met with
Quintanilla in a videotaped meeting at a hotel in nearby Pharr, Texas.
At the behest of government agents, Quintanilla asked Vigil whether
Partida forced him to provide escort services to the drug shipment.
Vigil responded, "Nah . . . I'm cool with it." Vigil also stated that
prior to Partida requesting his services, he planned on asking Partida
about the possibility of continuing drug escort activities a second
time.

Two days later, on November 9, 2001, a similar "drill" was set up, with
Vigil meeting Quintanilla (who was again driving a camera-equipped red
Suburban without any drugs) at the southern city limits of Donna.
Quintanilla phoned Partida ahead of time to tell him that he had 300
pounds of marijuana, and he later called both Partida and Vigil as he
approached the designated meeting point. The operation went off as
planned, and was captured on videotape as Quintanilla drove up FM 493
with Vigil following closely behind. Later that day, after the reverse
sting operation was completed, Vigil and Quintanilla met again at the
Comfort Inn in Pharr, Texas. Quintanilla paid Vigil \$ 700 (he had
already received \$ 100 "up front"). Later, Partida arrived at the hotel
room, Quintanilla paid him \$ 2,200, and Partida placed the payment in
his boot.

Partida was subsequently arrested on November 12, 2002. \[He and Vigil
eventually gave written confessions.\]

A federal grand jury issued a five-count indictment against Partida and
Vigil. Count 1 charged that Partida attempted to aid, abet, and assist
in the possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute,
in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841 (b)(1)(B), and 846, and 18
U.S.C. § 2. Counts 2 and 5 charged that Partida ... \[committed\]
extortion under color of official right, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1951(a) (Hobbs Act). Count 3 charged both Partida and Vigil with
conspiring to possess 300 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute
.... Count 4 charged Vigil with ... extortion under color of official
right, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).

On February 18, 2003, Partida and Vigil were tried together and
presented the sole defense of entrapment. Partida and Vigil presented no
other evidence at the guilt phase of their trial. On February 21, 2003,
a jury convicted Partida of all charges against him. The same jury
convicted Vigil of extortion, but acquitted him of conspiracy.

 On May 21, 2003, the district court sentenced Partida to concurrent
terms of 151 months incarceration, to be followed by concurrent
four-year terms of supervised release. \[Vigil was sentenced to 97
months incarceration followed by supervised release.\] ...

DISCUSSION

... Partida contends that count one of the indictment charged no crime
proscribed by Congress. Partida asserts that strictly construing 18
U.S.C. § 2 and 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846 collectively does not state an
offense. Specifically, Partida asserts that the plain meaning of those
statutes does not proscribe "attempting to aid, abet, and assist" the
possession with intent to distribute marijuana. We find this argument
unavailing for two reasons: an analogous Model Penal Code provision and
our circuit's precedent explicitly address and reject the basis of the
contention we face here.

 

 We begin with the analogous law of criminal attempt under Model Penal
Code 5.01(3), which provides:

A person who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit a
crime that would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the
crime were committed by such other person, is guilty of an attempt to
commit the crime, although the crime is not committed or attempted by
such other person.

Model Penal Code and Commentaries (Official Draft and Revised Comments),
Part I, § 5.01(3) (A.L.I. 1985). The Model Code identifies the purpose
behind subsection (3) in an explanatory note as follows:

Subsection (3) fills what would otherwise be a gap in complicity
liability. Section 2.06 \[of the Model Penal Code\] covers accomplice
liability in situations where the principal actor actually commits the
offense, however, it is provided here that the accomplice will be liable
if he engaged in conduct that would have established his complicity had
the crime been committed.

Id. at 297-98 (explanatory note to § 5.01(3)). The quoted passage is
important here because it refers to *attempting* to aid and abet a
crime, similar to the facts before us, in the context of an offense for
which the principle may not be guilty.

In interpreting § 5.01(3), it is clear that on the one hand, if the
principal actually attempts to commit a crime, but fails to render the
crime complete, the Model Code imputes liability to the aider and
abettor for the same offense as the principal \-- attempting to commit a
crime. Once the prosecution proves an attempted act of assistance with
the required mens rea, the accomplice becomes the perpetrator's shadow
and he is as culpable as his perpetrating cohort. On the other hand, the
plain meaning of § 5.01(3) also demonstrates, as here, that if the
principal had only pretended to commit the crime, and the accomplice
attempted to aid the principal by "engaging in conduct that would have
established his complicity had the crime been committed," the accomplice
is culpable for attempting to commit the crime. United States v.
Washington, 106 F.3d 983, 1005 (D.C. Cir. 1997). As our fellow D.C.
Circuit has emphasized, the justification for permitting convictions on
the basis of "attempt to aid and abet" is necessitated because "even if
an offense was not actually committed, the defendant manifests the same
dangerousness of character as the actor who himself attempts to commit
the offense." Id.

In addition to the Model Code, on more than one occasion we have upheld
convictions and recognized that a defendant's attempt to aid or abet in
the commission of a crime is sufficient for criminal liability. In
United States v. Cartlidge, 808 F.2d 1064, 1065 (5th Cir. 1987), an
action virtually similar to ours, a known user of controlled substances
informed government agents that the defendant, a deputy sheriff in
Sharkey County, Mississippi, approached him and solicited payments in
exchange for law enforcement protection for drug deals. The agents
launched a sting operation arranging for undercover agents, posing as
drug smugglers, to be introduced to the corrupt deputy sheriff by the
informant. Id. Using a concealed instrument, government agents recorded
the defendant promising to provide police protection to planes landing
in Sharkey County loaded with thousands of pounds of marijuana, in
return for payment of \$ 1,000 per load. Id. at 1066. Although the drug
operation that the defendant intended to assist did not actually exist
(since the undercover agents were only pretending to be drug dealers),
the defendant was charged and convicted of attempting to aid and abet in
the federal crime of possession and distribution of marijuana. On
appeal, this court upheld the conviction for attempting to aid and abet
in the drug offense. We emphasized that under 21 U.S.C. § 846, Congress
imposes criminal punishment on "any person who attempts or conspires to
commit any offense" enumerated in the Act. Id. Similarly, in United
States v. Gutierrez, 343 F.3d 415, 417 (5th Cir. 2003), the defendant
was a San Antonio police officer who agreed to provide security for drug
deals, to "run interference," and to protect against competing drug
dealers. Again, this court affirmed the defendant's conviction for
attempting to aid and abet the possession of a controlled substance with
intent to distribute. Id. at 416. Consistently this court has affirmed
convictions of attempting to aid and abet the possession of a controlled
substance with intent to distribute.

Based on our interpretation of the analogous § 5.01(3) of the Model Code
and this court's precedent, we conclude that federal criminal law
prohibits attempting to aid and abet the possession of a controlled
substance with intent to distribute. Hence, in light of this court's
precedent and a reading of the relevant statute, count 1 of the
indictment sufficiently charged Partida with conduct contemplated and
proscribed by Congress....

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm both Partida's and Vigil's
convictions and sentences....

 

 

 

United States v. Hostetter

 

2023 WL 4539842 (D.D.C. 2023)

 

**Notes for Oral Ruling from the Bench under Rule 23(c)**

Lamberth, J.

The following are the notes that the Court used when delivering its oral
verdict today: These are the specific findings of fact under Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(c) that explain my verdict in this nonjury
case....

Before I start, I want to make one thing clear about all the charges.
Mr. Hostetter \[a former police chief in La Habra, California\] is not
being prosecuted for engaging in protected First Amendment activity, and
I am making my decision without regard to his political beliefs, which I
believe he holds sincerely. Mr. Hostetter has a right to believe
whatever he likes about the 2020 Presidential Election, and to voice
those opinions. But the First Amendment does not give anyone a right to
obstruct or impede Congress by making it impossible for them to do their
jobs safely. And it certainly does not give anyone a right to enter a
restricted area while carrying a dangerous weapon.

Additionally, I want to note that Mr. Hostetter has not presented any
evidence that could make out an entrapment defense on the theory that
the January 6 riot was a staged event....

Count One of the Second Superseding Indictment charges Mr. Hostetter
with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1512(k). That charge requires the government to have proved
each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

1.  First, the defendant conspired or agreed with at least one other
    person with the goal of committing the crime of corruptly
    obstructing an official proceeding \[to wit, the Certification of
    the Electoral College vote\]; and

2.  Second, the defendant knowingly and intentionally joined or entered
    into that agreement with awareness of and the intent to further its
    unlawful goal.

I conclude that the government has proved each of those elements beyond
a reasonable doubt.

Mr. Hostetter and Mr. \[Russell\] Taylor conspired together to obstruct
and impede the Electoral College Certification. Mr. Hostetter and Mr.
Taylor agreed to travel to Washington, D.C. to intimidate Congress on
January 6 into challenging the Electoral College count and turning the
selection of the next President over to the states. Mr. Hostetter and
Mr. Taylor communicated extensively regarding their goal of seeing the
election result changed. Mr. Hostetter testified that he and
Mr.** **Taylor agreed to come to Washington, D.C., together on January
6, and that they were closely monitoring efforts to overturn the
election results and news regarding the Electoral College Certification
process. In connection with January 6, Mr. Hostetter agreed to transport
weapons and tactical gear for Mr. Taylor that Mr. Taylor intended to
bring to the Capitol, including hatchets, a knife, pepper spray, stun
batons, a collapsible baton, an armored plate carrier, a gas mask, and a
bulletproof helmet. This was not the first time that Mr. Hostetter
transported weapons and tactical gear on behalf of Mr. Taylor in
connection with a protest against the results of the 2020 Presidential
Election. In November 2020, Mr. Hostetter transported largely the same
inventory of items in connection with a Presidential Election protest in
Washington, D.C. Because that protest did not succeed in altering the
trajectory of the election, Mr. Hostetter and Mr. Taylor agreed to
return to Washington, D.C. to intimidate Congress into definitively
resolving the election in then-President Trump's favor. Mr. Hostetter
and Mr. Taylor coordinated their arrival in Washington, D.C. On the
morning of January 6, Mr.** **Hostetter and Mr. Taylor met and proceeded
to the Capitol together. Once at the Capitol, they proceeded in tandem
under the inauguration stage scaffolding, up a set of stairs to the
inauguration stage, past a police line to the inauguration stage
bleachers, and ultimately ascended together to the Upper West Terrace.
Except for thirty minutes on the Upper West Terrace, Mr. Hostetter and
Mr. Taylor were together for the entire duration of the Capitol Riot.
After viewing all the evidence, there is no doubt in my mind that Mr.
Hostetter knowingly and intentionally conspired with Mr. Taylor to
accomplish the common objective of unlawfully obstructing and impeding
the Electoral College Certification.

I find that there was an agreement between Mr. Hostetter and Mr. Taylor
to corruptly obstruct the Electoral College Certification and that Mr.
Hostetter knowingly and intentionally entered into that agreement with
the intent of furthering its unlawful goal. Mr. Taylor, as a member of
the board of Mr. Hostetter\'s organization, the American Phoenix
Project, had a close relationship with Mr. Hostetter and assisted him
with planning protests, speeches, and acts of civil disobedience. GX
\[government exhibit\] 923.02 shows** **that Mr. Hostetter described Mr.
Taylor as his bodyguard and a member of the Board of Directors of Mr.
Hostetter\'s organization. Telegram messages between Mr. Hostetter and
Mr. Taylor ... show that Mr. Hostetter and Mr. Taylor communicated
regarding the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election and the
likelihood that the results would be overturned. These and other
exhibits show that Mr. Hostetter and Mr. Taylor immediately began
coordinating plans to travel to Washington, D.C., after President Trump
called for a \"wild protest\" on January 6. Mr. Taylor created several
Telegram groups that were used in connection with organizing for January
6 including \"So Cal Patriots,\" \"California Patriots Answer the
Call,\" \"California Patriots DC Brigade,\" and \"California Patriots
SpecOps." I find that Mr. Hostetter was a member of these groups, was
aware of the groups, and met fellow participants on the Upper West
Terrace, as shown by GX 519. Within the DC Brigade group and other
groups, participants exchanged several messages describing their
planning for January 6 and their eagerness for the events of that day,
including Mr.** **Taylor\'s desire to \"storm the Capitol.\" Other
participants in the DC Brigade discussed bringing weapons and engaging
in acts of violence. GX 318 shows Mr. Hostetter and Mr. Taylor mutually
celebrating learning that rioters had breached the inside of the Capitol
Building. And GX 925 shows that after the riot, Mr. Hostetter bragged in
a text message that he and Mr. Taylor had stormed the Capitol. GX 515,
which is a social media post, shows Mr. Hostetter and another person
standing next to Mr. Taylor and holding a hatchet gifted to him by Mr.
Taylor. Subsequent social media posts by Mr. Hostetter ... show that he
was focused on January 6 and the joint session of Congress that would be
taking place that day. Mr. Hostetter\'s and Mr. Taylor\'s testimony
along with exhibits such as GX 908.18 demonstrate that Mr. Hostetter
proposed and agreed to transport weapons from California to Washington,
D.C., on behalf of Mr. Taylor. Mr. Hostetter actually transported those
weapons knowing and intending that Mr. Taylor would carry those weapons
on January 6. As shown by GX 907.10 and 908.05, Mr. Hostetter agreed to
and actually transported weapons for Mr. Taylor in connection with** **a
November 2020 Presidential Election protest in Washington, D.C., as
well. I credit Mr. Taylor\'s testimony that because Mr. Hostetter
founded and headed the American Phoenix Project, Mr. Taylor had to go
through Mr. Hostetter when planning events and publishing information
publicly under the American Phoenix Project name....

In summary, the evidence of communications between Mr. Hostetter and Mr.
Taylor, Mr. Hostetter\'s actions for the benefit of Mr. Taylor and Mr.
Taylor\'s actions for the benefit of Mr. Hostetter, Mr. Hostetter\'s and
Mr. Taylor\'s stated goals and objectives for January 6, the planning
and organization for January 6 undertaken together by Mr. Hostetter and
Mr. Taylor, and the close alignment and near-continuous contact between
Mr. Hostetter and Mr. Taylor on January 6 itself, established beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Hostetter conspired with Mr. Taylor to
obstruct and impede the Electoral College Certification and entered into
that agreement with awareness of and intent to further its goal of
obstruction and impediment in pursuit** **of his political ends. It is
sufficient for this count that two people, namely Mr. Hostetter and Mr.
Taylor, agreed to join together to accomplish this unlawful purpose.
Other people need not have joined their agreement for it to constitute a
conspiracy.

For these reasons, I find defendant Alan Hostetter GUILTY of Count
One.... \[The court also found defendant guilty of three other charges:
obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(c)(2); entering or remaining in a
restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(1), (b)(1)(A); and disorderly or
disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or
dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(2), (b)(1)(A).\]

 

 

 

Notes and Questions

 

Did Mr. Hostetter succeed in accomplishing the object of his
conspiracy---that is, did he (along with others) "obstruct an official
proceeding"? Does his guilt on the conspiracy charge require that he
succeed in, or accomplish, the object of the conspiracy?

Orear v. United States

 

261 F. 257 (5th Cir. 1919)

 

GRUBB, District Judge. The plaintiffs in error were tried and convicted
in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for conspiracy.
The indictment contained three counts. The plaintiffs in error were
convicted only on the counts numbered 1 and 2. These counts charged an
offense under section 6 of the Penal Code (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35
Stat. 1089 \[Comp. St. § 10170\]), while the third count charged an
offense under section 37 of the Penal Code (section 10201). Under counts
1 and 2, proof of an overt act was not required to convict. These counts
charged the plaintiffs in error, together with others, some of whom
pleaded guilty, and three of whom were acquitted, with conspiracy to
resist the enforcement of a law of the United States, viz. the Selective
Service Act, approved May 18, 1917 (40 Stat. 76, c. 15 \[Comp. St. 1918,
§§ 2019a, 2019b. 2044a-2044k\]), by resisting by force the calling of
registrants, in Rains County, Tex., and by resisting state
or** **government officers who might attempt to arrest such persons for
failing to comply with the law, and by procuring arms and ammunition
necessary to prevent by force the drafting of persons of said county,
who had registered, into the military service of the United States.

There are 22 errors assigned. The questions presented by them are three:
First, whether there was evidence in the record sufficient to show a
conspiracy on the part of the 17 plaintiffs in error of the kind charged
in the first counts of the indictment; second, whether the plaintiffs in
error abandoned any conspiracy they may have formed, before guilt
attached to them; third, whether the District Judge charged correctly
upon the law of accomplice evidence.

The evidence is voluminous. It related to what happened at two
meetings---one at New Home schoolhouse on a Sunday night, and the other
at Sandy Eddy on the following Monday afternoon---and to the subsequent
purchase of weapons by some of the plaintiffs in error. The holding of
the meetings was not in dispute, nor the presence of the plaintiffs in
error at one or both of them. The purpose of the meetings, the extent of
participation of the various** **plaintiffs in the error in them, and
the abandonment of the project at the second meeting, as claimed by
plaintiffs in error, and the purpose for which some of the plaintiffs in
error procured guns after the two meetings, were the disputed questions
of fact. The government offered substantial evidence tending to show
that the plaintiffs in error were at the New Home schoolhouse meeting,
and that at that meeting inflammatory speeches were made, directed
against the drafting of young men who had registered and the sending of
them to France to fight Germany, and that two votes were taken at that
meeting---one in which the younger men within the draft age
participated, to the effect that they would prefer to die at home to
dying in France, and the other, in which the older men, who were over
the draft age, alone participated, to the effect that they would stand
behind the younger men in the carrying out of their resolve.

In connection with the seditious remarks testified to have been made at
the first meeting preceding the taking of the two votes and the evidence
tending to show a guilty sense of having violated the law, and the
suspicion of the presence of a spy, the jury might well** **have found
from the government\'s evidence that a conspiracy to forcibly resist the
Selective Service Act was there intended and formed. It is true that the
witnesses for the defendants, if believed, gave an entirely different
and an innocent complexion to the meeting. The defendants\' evidence
tended to show that the meeting was open and public, and not secret. Its
purpose, according to the defendants\' evidence, was merely to discuss a
supposed overdraft in Rains county, and to take steps to secure a
contribution to pay the expenses of a committee, which had gone to
Austin the preceding day to attempt to secure an adjustment of the
overdraft, and it was claimed by defendants that nothing seditious was
spoken at the meeting; the discussion being confined to the question of
the overdraft and the expense attending its adjustment. The
determination of the correct version of the purpose of and of what
happened at the New Home schoolhouse meeting was for the jury, and they
determined it upon substantial evidence adversely to the contentions of
the plaintiffs in error.

The New Home schoolhouse meeting adjourned to meet the next afternoon at
the place of the plaintiff in error, Will Orear, at Sandy Eddy. The
plaintiffs in error assert that the record fails to show that a
completed conspiracy was formed at the first meeting, and contend that
tentative discussion does not constitute a conspiracy in law. We are of
the opinion that the votes taken at the first meeting might have been
interpreted by the jury as an agreement on the part of those present and
voting to resist the draft law by those subject to draft, and to aid
those subject to draft in forcibly resisting it by those who were beyond
the draft age. The conspiracy may have been smaller in numbers than the
attendance at either of the meetings, and yet the inner conspiracy would
fasten guilt upon the conspirators, though others who attended the
meetings were innocent. We think it was open to the jury to find that
plaintiffs in error were parties to the conspiracy, because of what the
government\'s evidence tended to show transpired at the New Home
schoolhouse.

The District Judge charged the jury that, in order to convict the
defendants, they must believe from the evidence that the conspiracy was
complete, and not merely tentative. It is true that at the subsequent
meeting at Sandy Eddy little was** **added to the government\'s case.
The meeting assembled at the place designated at the first meeting, and
was addressed by a lawyer named Berzette, who advised them, according to
the government\'s contention, that their assembly might be held to be a
violation of the law, and on this advice the meeting dispersed, without
doing anything further. The defendants\' contention was that Berzett
advised the meeting that the committee that went to Austin had returned
with the report that Rains County had been treated fairly in the draft,
and, upon receipt of this information, the people dispersed and went
home satisfied.

The government\'s evidence tended to show that the plaintiff in error
John Trumble, after Berzett had spoken, called an informal meeting and
with some of the plaintiffs in error renewed the design of resisting the
draft by force, if it became necessary. If the government established a
conspiracy in which the plaintiffs in error participated, by what took
place at the New Home schoolhouse meeting, the crime was then completed
and the guilt of the plaintiffs in error was then fixed beyond
repentance, and a subsequent dissolution of the conspiracy and an
abandonment of the project** **at the Sandy Eddy meeting, if it had
occurred, would not have relieved plaintiffs in error from criminal
responsibility.

Section 6 of the Penal Code does not base conspiracy on the doing of an
overt act, as does section 37 of the Penal Code. It is, in this respect,
like the Sherman Anti-Trust Act .... Under that act the Supreme Court
held that common-law conspiracies were made punishable, and that it did
not make \"the doing of any act other than the act of conspiring a
condition of liability.\" Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373.
Withdrawal from the conspiracy after its formation would not exculpate
from guilt, under the charge made in the only counts upon which the
plaintiffs in error were found guilty. We are not to be understood as
holding that the evidence as to what transpired at the Sandy Eddy
meeting indicated an abandonment of the project upon the part of the
plaintiffs in error, though it may as to some of those who attended.

The evidence of the government as to what happened after the Sandy Eddy
meeting had broken up, and in the group around the defendant** **John
Trumble, is corroborated by the evidence, which shows the subsequent
procuring of high-power guns by some of the plaintiffs in error. The
sufficiency of the explanation of the purposes for which these guns were
procured, given by the plaintiffs in error, who were concerned in
procuring them, was for the jury. The coincidence of so many of them
having procured rifles immediately after the meeting and having made two
trips to Dallas, 80 miles distant, in the automobile of the plaintiff in
error Pffer Orear, and the subsequent hiding of the guns by the
plaintiff in error Will Orear, in connection with the explanations given
by him and by his father of the purpose for which he hid them, left
plenty of room for the jury to have inferred that they were procured for
the purpose charged by the government, and testified to by those of the
defendants who entered pleas of guilty and who testified for the
government.

We think there was sufficient evidence introduced on the trial to
justify the jury in finding that an illegal conspiracy to forcibly
resist the draft had been consummated; that it had not been abandoned,
at least by the plaintiffs in error (if that were necessary to be
shown), but had been carried out by some of the plaintiffs in error to
the extent of getting guns to that end.

The court charged the jury that---

\"In weighing the evidence of those defendants who are testifying for
the government, you should have due regard to the fact that they have
each pleaded guilty to the indictment, as well as to the fact of their
being defendants, though not on trial. You are directed to weigh
carefully their testimony, and cautioned against placing too firm a
reliance upon it, unless the same should be corroborated by testimony of
witnesses other than principals, or by other facts and circumstances
that verify their testimony in material particulars.\"

In the federal courts, the testimony of accomplices may be sufficient to
convict, in the absence of corroboration. Diggs and Caminetti v. United
States, 242 U.S. 471. In this case there was in fact corroboration of
facts proven by witnesses other than participants in the conspiracy. The
charge of the District Judge was all that the plaintiffs in error were
entitled to upon the subject of accomplice testimony. It pointed out
with sufficient** **clearness what witnesses were to be treated as
accomplices---those who testified for the government and who had either
entered pleas of guilty to the indictment, or who were shown to have
been principals in the conspiracy by the evidence.

We find no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.

 

 

 

Wells v. United States

 

257 F. 605 (9th Cir. 1919)

 

WOLVERTON, District Judge.

... The next question presented for consideration is whether the trial
court committed error in refusing to grant defendants\' motion for** **a
directed verdict, on the ground that the testimony does not show the
commission of the offense charged. The testimony is all in the record,
and it is for the court to say whether it is sufficient to carry the
case to the jury for their determination.

In the trial court\'s charge to the jury, the two counts of the
indictment were consolidated and treated as one offense. To this manner
of treating the case there seems to have been no objection, by either
the government or the defendants. Proceeding upon this theory, the
particular charge against defendants is that they conspired to oppose by
force, and to prevent, hinder, and delay, the execution of the joint
resolution of Congress of April 6, 1917, declaring that a state of war
existed between the United States and the Imperial German government,
authorizing the President to employ the entire naval and military forces
of the United States and the resources of the government, and pledging
the resources of the country for bringing the conflict to a successful
termination; also the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, section 57
of which provides that:

\"The militia of the United States shall consist of all
able-bodied** **male citizens of the United States and all other
able-bodied males who have or who shall have declared their intention to
become citizens of the United States, who shall be more than eighteen
years of age, and, except as hereinafter provided, not more than
forty-five years of age, and said militia shall be divided into three
classes, the National Guard, the naval militia, and the unorganized
militia.\" Comp. St. § 3041.

And section 79:

\"If for any reason there shall not be enough voluntary enlistments to
keep the reserve battalions at the prescribed strength, a sufficient
number of unorganized militia shall be drafted into the service of the
United States to maintain each of such battalions at the proper
strength.\" Comp. St. § 3044q.

And also the act of January 21, 1903, as amended by the act of May 27,
1908, which authorizes the President, whenever the United States is in
danger of being invaded by a foreign nation, to call forth the state
militia to repel such invasion.

Keeping this statement in mind as a premise, we will give attention to
the evidence. Let us emphasize, before proceeding, that force is an
essential element of the offense, and likewise in the charge, and
that** **mere solicitation or entreaty, without a purpose of applying or
using force to accomplish the ends sought to be attained, is without the
intendment of section 6 of the Penal Code, under which the indictment is
drawn.

In the latter part of April and early in May, 1917, meetings were
assembled in Seattle, Wash., under the auspices of an association of
persons known as the \"No Conscription League.\" At these meetings there
was prepared and adopted by the league a circular entitled \"No
Conscription, No Involuntary Servitude, No Slavery.\" Twenty thousand of
these circulars were printed, and persons attending the meetings
circulated them in certain parts of the city, going from house to house
and leaving them as they passed along. The circular reads as follows:

The testimony tends to show that the defendant Wells was present at two
or more of these meetings, and took part in discussions pertaining to
the circular. He took the copy** **to the printer and had it printed,
corrected the proof, and paid for the printing, part of it from his own
funds, and part through collections made at one of the meetings. He also
directed the delivery of the printed circulars at the hall where a later
meeting was held, and himself distributed some of the circulars. Sadler
was present at at least one of the meetings, that of May 11, 1917, and
took part in the discussions along with Wells. The \"No Conscription\"
circulars were on the table in the assembly room at the time, and a
number of persons took them away for distribution, but that Sadler took
any of them away with him does not seem to be confirmed. Morris Pass
attended two or more of the meetings, and at one acted as secretary,
collected part of the money to pay for printing the circulars, and
turned what he collected and that which came into his hands for that
purpose over to Wells. He also distributed some of the circulars. Joe
Pass was present at one or two of the meetings, took part in the
discussion respecting the circular, and tacitly assented to its
distribution. We have not attempted a survey of all the testimony
adduced at the trial.

The defendants contend that** **the purpose of the circular was to
oppose the passage of the conscription act, then pending in Congress,
peaceably and without the use of force in any way, and the testimony for
defendants seems to support the view that the discussions at these
meetings took that turn. If force was to be employed, the fact must be
deduced from the wording of the circular and the activities of the
defendants in procuring its adoption and distribution among the people
in Seattle. What was said in the discussions that took place pertaining
to the nature and character of the document to be adopted has not been
shown, except in a general way, and no other language of a seditious
nature has been shown to have been uttered by the defendants, or any of
them, unless the resolution that was introduced by Wells at the Labor
Temple in Seattle, and adopted, demanding exemption from military
service on the ground of conscientious scruples, can be so construed. We
consider the inquiry, however, aside from the effect and purpose of this
resolution.

Attention should be directed more particularly to the wording of the
latter clauses of the circular beginning with \"Resist! Refuse!\" It
will thus be seen** **that the language urging resistance to
conscription is very strong, breathing defiance to the constituted
authorities, and, considering along with it the energy displayed in
procuring the adoption and wide distribution of the circular, there
would seem to be scope for reasonable men to draw the inference that it
was intended, by those who were instrumental in its preparation and
distribution, that force should be employed, if requisite, against the
carrying into effect of the declaration of war by Congress, in pursuance
of which Congress was proceeding to put the Selective Draft Act upon the
statute, and to oppose by force the authority of the President in
putting into execution the law respecting the militia, as referred to in
the indictment, and the laws themselves carrying such authorization. We
think, therefore, the evidence was sufficient upon which to submit the
cause to the jury. It was not necessary to show that force was actually
employed, but only that there was a conspiracy entered into that
contemplated the employment of force, as a means to the accomplishment
of a common purpose to oppose the execution of a law of the United
States, or the authority of the government** **to prosecute the war.

Objection was interposed to the admission of a resolution that was
introduced by Wells, on May 23, 1917, at a meeting of the Central Labor
Council in the city of Seattle, wherein organized workers, among other
things, demanded of the government exemption from military service of
all those who had conscientious objections to the war, as prejudicial.
It had a tendency to show Wells\' attitude of mind towards the
Conscription Act, at least, and was admissible for that, if for no other
purpose.

Another objection was interposed to the admission of the testimony of
one Fraser, to the effect that he found one of the circulars on the
front porch of his home, within a block of the boundary line of the Ft.
Lawton military reservation, and that he showed it to a Mrs. Knight,
also as prejudicial to defendants. It was proper to show the extent to
which the circulars had been distributed, and this evidence was
pertinent to that purpose.

While the defendant Wells was on the witness stand, he was asked:

\"What steps were taken by the local branches, by yourself and other
members, with reference to opposing the Conscription Act?\"

** **The government having objected, witness was not permitted to
answer, and this is assigned as error. The local branches referred to
were branches of a national organization of Socialists known as the
\"American Union against Militarism.\" Wells had testified that he had
taken part in the movement, and had attended meetings of the local
branch at different places in Seattle. The meetings were held before the
declaration of war. The witness continued:

\"The whole purpose of the society and of the defendant was to get
before the people the opinions offered by those who were favorably
disposed in their point of view to this movement to place it before
Congress. This society continued its agitation up to the time it was
seen that the country was about to get into the war. From that time
until the declaration of war they confined their efforts to trying to
bring about an honorable avoidance of the war. After war was declared by
the United States, the society ceased all opposition to the war itself.
After the war was declared, the organization kept together, because it
was thought there would be many occasions which would arise from time to
time which would require the liberty of the people to be safeguarded. It
was** **thought that conscription would quite likely become one of the
issues, and that the society and its members should endeavor to prevent
the enactment of such a law.\"

Wells having testified fully touching the organization known as the
\"American Union against Militarism,\" it was not essential to inquire
in detail as to what was done at the local branches and by the members
thereof touching the Conscription Act. He was permitted to explain fully
what part he took in opposing that act, and the inquiry sought to be
made could not appreciably help him or the other defendants. Otherwise,
the issue sought to be injected into the trial was collateral in its
scope, and irrelevant.

It further developed that the defendant Wells, in his opposition to the
adoption of the Conscription Act, wrote letters to members of Congress,
and especially to Congressman Dill, who wrote defendant in reply.
Counsel sought to introduce the letter from Dill, but was not permitted
by the court to do so. The declared purpose in introducing the letter
was to show that Dill agreed with Wells in his views on conscription,
and that Wells was acting in good faith in opposing the measure. If it
was relevant for him** **to show that others agreed with him, it should
have been done by the sworn testimony of other witnesses. It was wholly
incompetent to prove the fact by unsworn ex parte statements of the
kind.

Anna Louise Strong, a witness for defendants, was asked as to the
purpose of the local branch of the general organization of the Union
against Militarism. She was not permitted to answer, over the objections
of the government, and error is assigned. It was explained by
defendants\' counsel that the question was preliminary, for the purpose
of leading up to other questions. The exception is without merit, for
the reason that it is not stated what the witness would have testified
in answer to the question, and the court is not advised as to the
relevancy of the matter sought to be elicited.

Frank B. Greene, who was a stenographer and engaged in the Secret
Service department of the United States, being called as a witness for
the government, testified that he, with others, interviewed defendants
Joe and Morris Pass in New York, and that at the time he took what was
said at the interview in shorthand, and subsequently transcribed it. He
related what the Pass brothers said to him, which testimony was admitted
in evidence without objection. Joe and Morris Pass were witnesses in
their own behalf, and while on the stand (and especially Joe Pass)
disputed the correctness of Greene\'s testimony touching parts of the
interview in New York. Greene was recalled in rebuttal, and interrogated
as to Joe Pass\' rendition of the interview, and the government was
thereupon permitted, over objection, to introduce the transcript of the
notes of the interview in evidence. The action of the court in this
respect is also assigned as error. Technically the transcript should not
have gone in, because the notes of the interview could be used by Greene
only for one purpose, namely, that of refreshing his memory in case he
was unable to testify from his independent recollection, and not as
substantive testimony of what was said there. But the field of the
interview seems to have been quite fully covered by Greene and the Pass
brothers, and for this reason it is not apparent wherein the defendants
have been injured by the introduction of the notes themselves. The error
was therefore harmless. The exception saved to the refusal of the court
to permit Greene to testify as to what** **the notes contained was
without merit, as the notes showed for themselves what they contained.

We come now to the instructions of the court. \... The first two of the
exceptions saved are directed to the following portions of the charge:

\"If you believe or if you have reasonable doubt as to whether the \'No
Conscription\' circular set out in the indictment and admitted in
evidence did not purpose to oppose by force or incite others to oppose
by force and hinder and delay the President in the execution of the
joint resolution of** **Congress, then, of course, you will not consider
it in that connection. But if you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that
the purpose and effect of the circular was to incite others by force to
oppose, hinder, and delay the execution of such resolution, then such
defendants who entered into such conspiracy would be guilty. In this
connection I think I should say that the defendants are presumed to know
the law, and cannot shield themselves behind ignorance of the law. The
law requires that all persons know what the law is. You are also
instructed that every person is presumed to intend the natural
consequences or results of his acts deliberately or knowingly done.

\"As stated, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to
oppose by force the authority of the United States, and to hinder and
delay the execution of its laws. You are instructed that this is an
element which must be established by the testimony on the part of the
government by the same degree of proof.

\"Force need not be actual physical force manifested by the defendants,
but must be such conduct, either acts, statements, invitations, or
solicitations, the evident purpose of which is to incite others
to** **the use of forcible resistance in hindering or delaying the
government of the United States in the execution of its laws. It is not
essential that the object of the conspiracy should actually have been
accomplished, or that force should actually have been used. Nor is it
essential that the conspirators should have agreed upon the precise
method of employing force or the weapons or instruments of such force.
If a conspiracy was formed, and the use of force was the natural or
necessary means of accomplishing the object of the conspiracy, and if
its use was necessarily incident to the carrying out of the plan of the
conspiracy, whether that force should be used by the defendants, or only
by those persons who should be induced to co-operate with them, then the
defendants would be guilty of the offense charged. Nor can the effect of
the circular be neutralized or limited by any motive or purpose or
intent not communicated with the circular. Nor could what Webster or any
one else said enter into this issue, or limit the effect of the
circular, if the natural and reasonable conclusion to be deduced from
the circular in evidence and what was done with it was to incite by
force opposition** **to the law of the United States as charged.

** **\"I think I should say in this connection, in view of the
suggestions during the trial and argument, that you are not concerned in
this case whether the war is right or not. We are at war now. There are
only two sides to the war. One side is in favor of this country; the
other side is against it. The policy of the government has been declared
and established, and no person can by force do anything that will hinder
or delay the government in carrying out that policy set out and defined
in the resolution referred to in the indictment. The defendants are not
charged with being against or in favor of the war, but with conspiracy
by force to oppose, hinder, or delay the government of the United States
in the execution of the resolution passed by the Congress with relation
to the war and in carrying it to a successful termination.\"

The criticism directed to the first of these instructions is to that
portion whereby the court told the jury that the defendants were
\"presumed to know the law and cannot shield themselves behind the
ignorance of the law. The law requires that all persons know what the
law is.\" It is urged that the** **publication of the circular in
question could not be construed as inherently felonious per se, and that
in criminal law every person is not presumed to know the law to such a
degree as to impose upon him a felonious purpose when in fact he might
have been ignorant of the law and have had no such purpose. Counsel
discusses the publication of the circular as if it were directed against
the Conscription Act, which had not then been adopted by Congress. Such
was not the case, and such was not the theory of the prosecution, or the
court. Indeed, the court elsewhere plainly told the jury that the
conspiracy, if any were formed, could not be made to offend against the
Conscription Act of May 18, 1917. The court gave no such intimation as
that the publication of the circular was felonious per se. What the
court said to the effect that defendants were presumed to know the law
is common knowledge, and, when construed in connection with the entire
charge, is not susceptible of the construction that counsel are disposed
to place upon it.

Further criticism is directed to the expression of the court that
\"every person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own
act.\" This is** **a common instruction given in cases where the
deliberate act of the defendant, by natural consequence, is to do an
injury to another or to the government, and, as applied to this case, it
has relation to the deliberate publication of a seditious circular. It
is urged that the instruction was prejudicial, and that, while it is
correct as an abstract legal proposition, it should not have been given
in this case, citing Hibbard v. United States, 172 Fed. 66, 96 C.C.A.
554, 18 Ann. Cas. 1040, in support of the argument. That case, however,
is one for devising a scheme with intent to defraud, and is clearly
distinguishable from one like this. To show this, we need only quote
from the opinion of the court on rehearing:

\"The error consists in applying it \[the instruction\] to a case
wherein, apart from the intent, the act is colorless; color being
thereby imparted, not to the intent by the color of the act, as the law
implies, but to the act itself by the color borrowed from the intent. In
cases like this where the act itself is, apart from the intent,
colorless, the color of the intent must be proven as any other element
of criminality is proven.\"

** **The present case is not** **one of that nature. It should be said
that here the court elsewhere told the jury that this presumption was
not conclusive, but probatory in character, and should be considered
with all the other elements disclosed by the testimony in the cause.
There was no error in giving the instruction.

As it relates to the second part of the instructions above quoted, the
criticism is directed to that particular clause where the court said:

\"Nor can the effect of the circular be neutralized or limited by any
motive or purpose or intent not communicated with the circular.\"

Standing alone, of course, this excerpt does not express the full or
explicit meaning which the court designed to convey; but when read in
connection with the clause following, and especially with what the court
said on the subject of intent, the criticism loses its potency. Nor is
the criticism of the court\'s instruction relative to the force
essential to be manifested by defendants entitled to greater weight. The
instruction on that subject is, in our opinion, a clear exposition of
the law as applicable.

... Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the trial court will
be affirmed.

 

 

 

 

 

When Extremists Stormed the Capitol and Got Convicted of Seditious

Schultz's article describes the attack on March 1, 1954, on the U.S.
Capitol by four Puerto Rican nationalist terrorists who shot and injured
five congressmen. The four shooters and thirteen other members of the
Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico (PNPR) were indicted on charges of
seditious conspiracy. All were convicted---four by guilty pleas,
thirteen at trial. In the 1970s, President Carter commuted the remaining
sentences of the four assailants.

State v. Bolsinger

 

Iowa Supreme Court

709 N.W.2d 560 (2006)

LARSON, Justice.

John Michael Bolsinger appealed his convictions of third-degree sexual
abuse under Iowa Code section 709.4(1) (2001), sexual exploitation by a
counselor under Iowa Code section 709.15(2), and sexual misconduct with
juvenile offenders under Iowa Code section 709.16(2). Bolsinger was
sentenced to a combination of concurrent and consecutive sentences
totaling a term not exceeding thirty-seven years. The court of appeals
affirmed, and we granted further review. We vacate the decision of the
court of appeals, reverse his conviction for sexual abuse, affirm the
remainder of the convictions, and remand.

**I. Facts and Prior Proceedings.**

Bolsinger was the program supervisor of a highly structured state
facility for delinquent boys, the Wittenmyer Youth Center, in August
2001 when the Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) conducted an
investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Bolsinger. The
investigation revealed, through interviews with past and present youth
at the camp, that Bolsinger would take boys into a private room and
touch their genitals, saying he was checking for bruises, scratches,
hernias, and testicular cancer. The testimony of the boys revealed that
Bolsinger asked permission to touch them in this way and that he did not
appear to them to be gaining any sexual gratification from the touching.
The boys testified that they were not aware that they were being touched
in a sexual manner, and they would not have consented if they had known
the true reason for the touching. However, they also testified that,
given the nature of the structured program, it was almost impossible for
them to make choices of their own or to refuse the request of an
instructor.

Following the DHS investigation, Davenport police officers obtained a
search warrant for Bolsinger\'s home and seized a number of items,
including the defendant\'s home computer. The computer\'s hard drive
contained, among other things, numerous stories involving unidentified
males engaging in sex acts with each other. Prior to trial, Bolsinger
filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from his home, which was
denied by the court.

**II. Issues.**

Bolsinger\'s appeal raises three issues: (1) the court\'s interpretation
of Iowa Code section 709.4(1) (third-degree sexual abuse), (2) its
denial of his motion to suppress, and (3) its refusal to direct verdicts
in his favor on all counts on the basis his acts were not \"sex acts\"
under the Code. Bolsinger raises other issues, which we do not expressly
discuss because their resolution is subsumed in other holdings in this
case.

**III. Interpretation of Iowa Code Section 709.4(1) (Third-Degree Sexual
Abuse).**

Under Iowa Code section 709.4,

\[a\] person commits sexual abuse in the third degree when the person
performs a sex act under any of the following circumstances:

1.  a.  The act is done by force or against the will of the other
        person, whether or not the other person is the person\'s spouse
        or is cohabiting with the person.

In applying the \"force or against the will\" language of section 709.4,
the court submitted Instruction No. 21:

Concerning \[the third-degree sexual abuse counts\] the State must prove
that the defendant committed a sex act \"by force or against the will\"
of the alleged victim in that Instruction. In order to do so, however,
the State does not have to prove that the alleged victim physically
resisted the defendant\'s acts. The force used by the defendant does not
have to be physical. *An act may be done \"by force and against the
will\" of another if the other\'s consent or acquiescence is procured
by:*

1.  a.  *threats of violence; or*

    b.  *deception, which may include deception concerning the nature of
        the act or deception concerning the defendant\'s* *right to
        exercise authority over the other under the circumstances.*

You may consider all of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\'s
act in deciding whether the act was done by force or against the will of
the alleged victim.

(Emphasis added.)

The court stated that its authority for giving this instruction was
found in Iowa Code section 709.5, which provides:

Under the provisions of this chapter it shall not be necessary to
establish physical resistance by a person in order to establish that an
act of sexual abuse was committed by force or against the will of the
person. *However, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
act may be considered in determining whether or not the act was done by
force or against the will of the other.*

(Emphasis added.) The court also relied on the case of *State v. Vander
Esch,* 662 N.W.2d 689 (Iowa Ct.App.2002). In *Vander Esch* the
defendant, an owner of a pizza restaurant, employed teenage boys. He
informed two of these employees that he was doing a scientific research
project and asked them to provide him semen samples for this purpose. He
promised to pay \$50 for the samples should their sperm count be high
enough. Vander Esch was present during the procedure and took possession
of the semen samples. *Vander Esch,* 662 N.W.2d at 691. Vander Esch was
not authorized by any scientific body to collect semen samples, and the
victims indicated that they would not have consented to these acts had
they known that no scientific research existed. *Id.* Vander Esch was
charged with four counts of third-degree sexual abuse under Iowa Code
section 709.4(1). He argued that the definition of sexual abuse, as set
out in Iowa Code section 709.1(1), set forth the only means recognized
in Iowa to negate consent and that neither fraud nor deceit did so.
*Id.* at 691.

Our examination of the issue must begin with Iowa Code section 709.1(1),
which defines sexual abuse and provides that certain circumstances will
vitiate a victim\'s consent:

Any sex act between persons is sexual abuse by either of the persons
when the act is performed with the other person in any of the following
circumstances:

1.  a.  The act is done by force or against the will of the other. If
        the consent or acquiescence of the other is procured by threats
        of violence toward any person or if the act is done while the
        other is under the influence of a drug inducing sleep or is
        otherwise in a state of unconsciousness, the act is done against
        the will of the other.

In *Vander Esch* the district court ruled that, in view of the fact that
Iowa Code section 709.5 permits the consideration of all surrounding
circumstances, section 709.1(1) is not exclusive and fraud and deception
may vitiate consent. The court of appeals upheld that decision,
classifying the fraud in question as fraud in fact, as opposed to fraud
in the inducement (concepts we later discuss), and therefore, the act
was done \"by force or against the will\" of the boys.

Bolsinger argues that the acts which occurred were hand-to-genital
contact, which was expressly agreed to by the boys. He argues that his
unexpressed purpose, apparently sexual gratification, was collateral to
the act itself and, therefore, constituted fraud only in the inducement.
As such, the fraud does not vitiate consent, according to him. Bolsinger
also argues that *Vander Esch,* relied on by the court of appeals (which
divided four to four on the question) and the district court in the
present case, was incorrectly decided and should be overruled. Bolsinger
argues that *Vander Esch* erroneously characterized the consent to semen
sampling as being produced by fraud in fact, and therefore, any consent
was vitiated.

If an act is done that is different from the act the defendant said he
would perform, this is fraud in fact. If the act is done as the
defendant stated it would be, but it is for some collateral or ulterior
purpose, this is fraud in the inducement. Fraud in fact vitiates
consent; fraud in the inducement does not. *See* Rollin M. Perkins &
Ronald N. Boyce, *Criminal Law* ch. 9, § 3, at 1079 (3d ed.1982)
\[hereinafter Perkins & Boyce\]. In other words,

if deception causes a misunderstanding as to the fact itself (fraud in
the *factum*) there is no legally-recognized consent because what
happened is not that for which consent was given; whereas consent
induced by fraud is as effective as other consent, so far as direct and
immediate legal consequences are concerned, if the deception relates not
to the thing done but merely to some collateral matter (fraud in the
inducement).

*Id.; accord* Wayne R. LaFave, *Substantive Criminal Law* § 6.5(a), at
506 (2d ed.2003) (stating that \"fraud in the factum involves a form of
deception which results in a misunderstanding by the victim as to the
very fact of the defendant\'s conduct\").

Cases illustrating fraud in fact have often involved victims undergoing
medical examination or treatment. In many cases, the victims consented
to an examination, only to find that the doctor engaged in sex acts.
*See, e.g.,* *People v. Ogunmola,* 193 Cal. App.3d 274, 238 Cal. Rptr.
300, 304 (1987) (patient who consented to gynecological examination was
in fact subjected to a sex act; consent held to be vitiated); *McNair v.
State,* 108 Nev. 53, 825 P.2d 571, 575 (1992) (sex acts under pretense
of performing medical examination held to be against the will of the
victim). *See generally regarding fraud in fact in \"doctor\" cases,*
Jay M. Zitter, *Annotation: \"Conviction of Rape or Related Sexual
Offenses on Basis of Intercourse Accomplished Under the Pretext of, or
in the Course of, Medical Treatment,\"* 65 A.L.R.4th 1064 (1988); 75
C.J.S. *Rape* § 22, at 334 (2002). One treatise discusses fraud in these
cases:

In some of these cases the doctor has not hesitated to make it clear
that he intended to have sexual intercourse with the patient, his fraud
being in the deceitful suggestion that this was necessary to cure some
malady, which was fraud in the inducement, since the patient knew
exactly what was to be done and was deceived only in regard to a
collateral matter --- the reason why it was to be done. And here as
usual the direct and immediate consequence of consent obtained by fraud
in the inducement is the same as consent given in the absence of fraud,
and since the patient consented to the intercourse it was not rape so
long as she was over the statutory age.

Perkins & Boyce, ch. 9, at 1079-80.

Bolsinger argues that each of these young men was told what the touching
would consist of and that they were then touched in the exact manner
they expected. Thus, he argues, any fraud was fraud in the inducement,
not fraud in fact.

In Bolsinger\'s case, if the boys had consented to acts such as
massaging their legs and instead Bolsinger had touched their genital
area, this would clearly be fraud in fact; they would have consented to
one act but subjected to a different one. That is not the case, however.
We conclude that the consents given here were based on fraud in the
inducement, not on fraud in fact, as the victims were touched in exactly
the manner represented to them. The consents, therefore, were not
vitiated.

In reaching this conclusion, we do so based on the authorities discussed
above and not on Bolsinger\'s alternative argument that Iowa\'s sex
abuse law in effect provides no way to vitiate consent based on fraud.
This argument, based on the doctrine of *inclusio unius est exclusio
alterius,* is that the Code sets out a limited list of circumstances
under which consent may be vitiated. These include the victim\'s age
(Iowa Code section 709.4(2)(*b*) and (*c*)), a mental defect or
incapacity (Iowa Code section 709.4(2)(*a*) and (4)), a physical
incapacity (Iowa Code section 709.4(4)), and the influence of controlled
substances (Iowa Code section 709.4(3)). Contrary to Bolsinger\'s
argument, we believe that these are not the only circumstances in which
consent can be vitiated and that fraud in fact should be held to vitiate
consent in sexual abuse cases just as it does in any other criminal
case. We rejected a similar *inclusio unius est exclusio alterius*
argument in *State v. Ramsey,* 444 N.W.2d 493 (Iowa 1989), which
involved a statute prohibiting the removal of a person without their
consent. We held that deception by the defendant vitiated the victim\'s
consent.

\[The defendant\] contends that because the word \"deception\" is not
used in section 710.1, it cannot form the basis upon which his
conviction rests. Ramsey is confusing means with ends, however.
Ramsey\'s intent, as expressed by his girlfriend and logically inferred
from subsequent events, was to remove an innocent person to a remote
location, shoot him, and steal his car. Whether the removal was
accomplished by force or artful deception, the end result remains the
same.

*Id.* at 494. *Ramsey* involved fraud in fact; the victim agreed to give
the defendant a ride, not to be shot in the back of the head. *Id.* at
493-94.

Our conclusion that the boys\' consent in this case was based on fraud
in the inducement and not fraud in fact calls into question the court of
appeals case of *Vander Esch.* In fact, in the four-to-four decision by
the court of appeals in Bolsinger\'s appeal, four members of that court
urge us to overrule *Vander Esch.* We now hold that *Vander Esch* is no
longer controlling because the facts on which that case was based
clearly show fraud in the inducement, not fraud in fact.

**IV. Remaining Issues.**

... B. *Were these \"sex acts\" under the applicable statutes?* The
defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his motion
for directed verdict as to all charges because \"sex acts,\" under the
Code, were not proved. We have already determined that Bolsinger\'s
conviction of third-degree sexual abuse cannot stand. The remaining
charges, sexual abuse by a counselor or therapist and sexual misconduct
with offenders, both require proof of sex acts. Bolsinger argues that
none of the young men testified there was anything sexual going on and
that the evidence was insufficient to establish the existence of sex
acts. The jury was instructed, based on Iowa Code section 702.17, that a
\"sex act\" is

\[a\]ny sexual contact between the fingers or hand of one person and the
genitals or anus of another person. 'Genitals' include the scrotum and
penis. You may consider the type of contact and the circumstances
surrounding it in deciding whether the contact was sexual in nature.

We believe there was substantial evidence to support the jury\'s finding
that sex acts had been committed. Direct evidence is not required.

The sexual nature of the contact can be determined from the type of
contact and the circumstances surrounding it\....

... Other relevant circumstances include but are not limited to the
relationship between the defendant and the victim; whether anyone else
was present; the length of the contact; the purposefulness of the
contact; whether there was a legitimate, nonsexual purpose for the
contact; where and when the contact took place; and the conduct of the
defendant and victim before and after the contact.

*State v. Pearson,* 514 N.W.2d 452, 455 (Iowa 1994). The evidence shows
that Bolsinger was acting outside the scope of his duties, his actions
took place in private, and he did not document these procedures,
contrary to the policy at Wittenmyer. Bolsinger had no medical training
other than information he had received in school on testicular cancer
and self-examination and was in a position of power over the victims.
Considered in light of this evidence a rational finder of fact could
conclude that Bolsinger committed sex acts under the guise of performing
medical examinations. The trial court did not err in overruling his
motions for judgment of acquittal on the charges of sexual abuse by a
counselor or sexual misconduct with offenders.

We reverse the convictions for third-degree sexual abuse and affirm the
remaining convictions. We remand for resentencing without regard to the
third-degree sexual abuse convictions under Iowa Code section 709.4(1).

Commonwealth v. Lopez

 

Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts

433 Mass. 722 (2001)

SPINA, J.

The defendant, Kenny Lopez, was convicted on two indictments charging
rape and one indictment charging indecent assault and battery on a
person over the age of fourteen years. We granted his application for
direct appellate review. The defendant claims error in the judge's
refusal to give a mistake of fact instruction to the jury. He asks us to
recognize a defendant's honest and reasonable belief as to a
complainant's consent as a defense to the crime of rape, and to reverse
his convictions and grant him a new trial. Based on the record
presented, we decline to do so, and affirm the convictions.

*Background*. We summarize facts that the jury could have found. On May
8, 1998, the victim, a seventeen-year-old girl, was living in a foster
home in Springfield. At approximately 3 p.m., she started walking to a
restaurant where she had planned to meet her biological mother. On the
way, she encountered the defendant. He introduced himself, asked where
she was going, and offered to walk with her. The victim met her mother
and introduced the defendant as her friend. The defendant said that he
lived in the same foster home as the victim and that "they knew each
other from school." Sometime later, the defendant left to make a
telephone call. When the victim left the restaurant, the defendant was
waiting outside and offered to walk her home. She agreed.

The two walked to a park across the street from the victim's foster home
and talked for approximately twenty to thirty minutes. The victim's
foster sisters were within earshot, and the victim feared that she would
be caught violating her foster mother's rules against bringing "a guy
near the house." The defendant suggested that they take a walk in the
woods nearby. At one point, deep in the woods, the victim said that she
wanted to go home. The defendant said, "trust me," and assured her that
nothing would happen and that he would not hurt her. The defendant led
the victim down a path to a secluded area.

The defendant asked the victim why she was so distant and said that he
wanted to start a relationship with her. She said that she did not want
to "get into any relationship." The defendant began making sexual
innuendos to which the victim did not respond. He grabbed her by her
wrist and began kissing her on the lips. She pulled away and said, "No,
I don't want to do this." The defendant then told the victim that if she
"had sex with him, \[she\] would love him more." She repeated, "No, I
don't want to. I don't want to do this." He raised her shirt and touched
her breasts. She immediately pulled her shirt down and pushed him away.

The defendant then pushed the victim against a slate slab, unbuttoned
her pants, and pulled them down. Using his legs to pin down her legs, he
produced a condom and asked her to put it on him. The victim said, "No."
The defendant put the condom on and told the victim that he wanted her
to put his penis inside her. She said, "No." He then raped her, and she
began to cry. A few minutes later, the victim made a "jerking move" to
her left. The defendant became angry, turned her around, pushed her face
into the slate, and raped her again. The treating physician described
the bruising to the victim's knees as "significant." The physician
opined that there had been "excessive force and trauma to the
\[vaginal\] area" based on his observation that there was "a lot of
swelling" in her external vaginal area and her hymen had been torn and
was "still oozing." The doctor noted that in his experience it was
"fairly rare" to see that much swelling and trauma.

The defendant told the victim that she "would get in a lot of trouble"
if she said anything. He then grabbed her by the arm, kissed her, and
said, "I'll see you later." The victim went home and showered. She told
her foster mother, who immediately dialed 911. The victim cried
hysterically as she spoke to the 911 operator.

The defendant's version of the encounter was diametrically opposed to
that of the victim. He testified that the victim had been a willing and
active partner in consensual sexual intercourse. Specifically, the
defendant claimed that the victim initiated intimate activity, and never
once told him to stop. Additionally, the defendant testified that the
victim invited him to a party that evening so that he could meet her
friends. The defendant further claimed that when he told her that he
would be unable to attend, the victim appeared "mildly upset."

Before the jury retired, defense counsel requested a mistake of fact
instruction as to consent. The judge declined to give the instruction,
saying that, based "both on the law, as well as on the facts, that
instruction is not warranted." Because the defendant's theory at trial
was that the victim actually consented and not that the defendant was
"confused, misled, or mistaken" as to the victim's willingness to engage
in sexual intercourse, the judge concluded that the ultimate question
for the jury was simply whether they believed the victim's or the
defendant's version of the encounter. The decision not to give the
instruction provides the basis for this appeal.

 *Mistake of fact instruction*. The defendant claims that the judge
erred in failing to give his proposed mistake of fact instruction. The
defendant, however, was not entitled to this instruction. In
*Commonwealth v. Ascolillo*, 405 Mass. 456 (1989), we held that the
defendant was not entitled to a mistake of fact instruction, and
declined to adopt a rule that "in order to establish the crime of rape
the Commonwealth must prove *in every case* not only that the defendant
intended intercourse but also that he did not act pursuant to an honest
and reasonable belief that the victim consented" (emphasis added). *Id*.
at 463, quoting *Commonwealth v. Grant*, 391 Mass. 645, 651 (1984).
Neither the plain language of our rape statute nor this court's
decisions prior to the *Ascolillo* decision warrant a different result.

 A fundamental tenet of criminal law is that culpability requires a
showing that the prohibited conduct (actus reus) was committed with the
concomitant mental state (mens rea) prescribed for the offense. See,
e.g., *Morissette v. United States*, 342 U.S. 246, 250 (1952) ("The
contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by
intention is no provincial or transient notion"). The mistake of fact
"defense" is available where the mistake negates the existence of a
mental state essential to a material element of the offense. See Model
Penal Code § 2.04(1)(a) (1985) ("Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of
fact or law is a defense if: \... the ignorance or mistake negatives the
purpose, knowledge, belief, recklessness or negligence required to
establish a material element of the offense"). In determining whether
the defendant's honest and reasonable belief as to the victim's consent
would relieve him of culpability, it is necessary to review the required
elements of the crime of rape.

At common law, rape was defined as "the carnal knowledge of a woman
forcibly and against her will." 4 W. Blackstone, *Commentaries* 210. See
*Commonwealth v. Chretien*, 383 Mass. 123, 127 (1981). Since 1642, rape
has been proscribed by statute in this Commonwealth. See *Commonwealth
v. Burke*, 105 Mass. 376, 380 (1870) (citing first rape statute codified
at 2 Mass. Col. Rec. 21). While there have been several revisions to
this statute, the definition and the required elements of the crime have
remained essentially unchanged since its original enactment. The current
rape statute, G. L. c. 265, § 22 (*b*), provides in pertinent part:

"Whoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a
person and compels such person to submit by force and against his will,
or compels such person to submit by threat of bodily injury, shall be
punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than twenty
years."

This statute follows the common-law definition of rape, and requires the
Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
committed (1) sexual intercourse (2) by force or threat of force and
against the will of the victim. See *Commonwealth v. Sherry*, 386 Mass.
682, 687 (1982) ("The essence of the crime of rape, whether aggravated
or unaggravated, is sexual intercourse with another compelled by force
and against the victim's will or compelled by threat of bodily injury").

As to the first element, there has been very little disagreement. Sexual
intercourse is defined as penetration of the victim, regardless of
degree. The second element has proven to be more complicated. We have
construed the element, "by force and against his will," as truly
encompassing two separate elements each of which must independently be
satisfied. See generally *Commonwealth v. Caracciola*, 409 Mass. 648,
653-654 (1991) (stating elements of "force" and "against his will" not
superfluous, but instead must be read together). Therefore, the
Commonwealth must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant committed sexual intercourse (1) by means of physical force,
*Commonwealth v. Sherry*, *supra* at 696; nonphysical, constructive
force, *Commonwealth v. Caracciola*, 409 Mass. at 653-655; or threats of
bodily harm, either explicit or implicit, *Commonwealth v. Sherry*,
*supra* ("threats of bodily harm, inferred or expressed"); and (2) at
the time of penetration, there was no consent.

Although the Commonwealth must prove lack of consent, the "elements
necessary for rape do not require that the defendant intend the
intercourse be without consent." *Commonwealth v. Grant*, 391 Mass. 645,
650, 464 N.E.2d 33 (1984). See *Commonwealth v. Cordeiro*, 401 Mass.
843, 851 n.11 (1988) ("The Commonwealth is not required to prove either
that the defendant intended the sexual intercourse be without consent or
that he had actual knowledge of the victim's lack of consent");
*Commonwealth v. Lefkowitz*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 518 (1985) ("As the
Supreme Judicial Court made clear in *Commonwealth v. Grant*, \[391
Mass. at 649,\] the crime of rape \... does not require for conviction
proof that the defendant harbored a 'specific intent that the
intercourse be without consent'"). Historically, the relevant inquiry
has been limited to consent in fact, and no mens rea or knowledge as to
the lack of consent has ever been required. See *Commonwealth v. Burke*,
105 Mass. at 377 ("The simple question, expressed in the briefest form,
is, Was the \[victim\] willing or unwilling?"). See also *Commonwealth
v. Lefkowitz*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 519 ("the prosecution has proved
rape if the jury concludes that the intercourse was in fact
nonconsensual \[that is, effectuated by force or by threat of bodily
injury\], without any special emphasis on the defendant's state of
mind").

A mistake of fact as to consent, therefore, has very little application
to our rape statute. Because G. L. c. 265, § 22, does not require proof
of a defendant's knowledge of the victim's lack of consent or intent to
engage in nonconsensual intercourse as a material element of the
offense, a mistake as to that consent cannot, therefore, negate a mental
state required for commission of the prohibited conduct. Any perception
(reasonable, honest, or otherwise) of the defendant as to the victim's
consent is consequently not relevant to a rape prosecution. See
Cavallaro, *Big Mistake: Eroding the Defense of Mistake of Fact About
Consent in Rape*, 86 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 815, 818 (1996) (mistake
of fact instruction is "available as a defense to a particular charge
only where the definition of the offense makes a defendant's mental
state as to a particular element material").

This is not to say, contrary to the defendant's suggestion, that the
absence of any mens rea as to the consent element transforms rape into a
strict liability crime. It does not. See *Commonwealth v. Cordeiro*, 401
Mass. 843, 850-851 n.11 (1988); *Commonwealth v. Grant*, 391 Mass. at
649-651. Rape, at common law and pursuant to G. L. c. 265, § 22, is a
general intent crime, *Commonwealth v. Troy*, 405 Mass. 253, 260 (1989),
citing *Commonwealth v. Grant*, 391 Mass. at 649-650, and proof that a
defendant intended sexual intercourse by force coupled with proof that
the victim did not in fact consent is sufficient to maintain a
conviction. See Bryden, *Redefining Rape*, 3 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 317,
325 (2000) ("At common law, rape was a 'general intent' crime: The
requisite intention was merely to perform the sexual act, rather than
have nonconsensual intercourse").

Other jurisdictions have held that a mistake of fact instruction is
necessary to prevent injustice. New Jersey, for instance, does not
require the force necessary for rape to be anything more than what is
needed to accomplish penetration. See *In re M.T.S*., 129 N.J. 422, 444
(1992) ("physical force in excess of that inherent in the act of sexual
penetration is not required for such penetration to be unlawful"). Thus,
an instruction as to a defendant's honest and reasonable belief as to
consent is available in New Jersey to mitigate the undesirable and
unforeseen consequences that may flow from this construction. By
contrast, in this Commonwealth, unless the putative victim has been
rendered incapable of consent, the prosecution must prove that the
defendant compelled the victim's submission by use of physical force;
nonphysical, constructive force; or threat of force. See *Commonwealth
v. Caracciola*, 409 Mass. 648, 653 (1991). See also *Commonwealth v.
Helfant*, 398 Mass. 214, 220-222 (1986) ("Because the victim there was
'so drunk as to be utterly senseless and incapable of consenting,' the
court upheld the conviction based on proof only of 'such force as was
necessary to effect the \[penetration\]'") (citation omitted). Proof of
the element of force, therefore, should negate any possible mistake as
to consent. See *Johnson v. State*, 204 Ga. App. 369 (1992). See also
Estrich, *Rape*, 95 Yale L.J. 1087, 1098-1099 (1986) ("The requirement
that sexual intercourse be accompanied by force or threat of force to
constitute rape provides a \[defendant\] with some protection against
mistakes as to consent").

 We also have concerns that the mistake of fact defense would tend to
eviscerate the long-standing rule in this Commonwealth that victims need
not use any force to resist an attack. See *Commonwealth v. Sherry*,
*supra* at 688, citing *Commonwealth v. McDonald*, 110 Mass. 405, 406
(1872). A shift in focus from the victim's to the defendant's state of
mind might require victims to use physical force in order to communicate
an unqualified lack of consent to defeat any honest and reasonable
belief as to consent. The mistake of fact defense is incompatible with
the evolution of our jurisprudence with respect to the crime of rape.

We are cognizant that our interpretation is not shared by the majority
of other jurisdictions. States that recognize a mistake of fact as to
consent generally have done so by legislation. Some State statutes
expressly require a showing of a defendant's intent as to nonconsent.
Alaska, for example, requires proof of a culpable state of mind. "Lack
of consent is a 'surrounding circumstance' which under the Revised Code,
requires a complementary mental state as well as conduct to constitute a
crime." *Reynolds v. State*, 664 P.2d 621, 625 (Alaska 1983). Because no
specific mental state is mentioned in Alaska's statute governing sexual
assault in the first degree, the State "must prove that the defendant
acted 'recklessly' regarding his putative victim's lack of consent."
*Id*. So understood, an honest and reasonable mistake as to consent
would negate the culpability requirement attached to the element of
consent. See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-3-402(1) (1999) ("Any actor who
knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual penetration on a victim
commits sexual assault \..."); Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 161.115(2) (1999)
("Except as provided in \[Or. Rev. Stat. § \] 161.105, if a statute
defining an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state,
culpability is nonetheless required and is established only if a person
acts intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence");
Tex. Penal Code § 22.021(a)(1)(A)(i) (West Supp. 2001) ("A person
commits an offense if the person \... intentionally or knowingly \...
causes the penetration of the anus or female sexual organ of another
person by any means, without that person's consent").

The New Jersey statute defines sexual assault (rape) as "any act of
sexual penetration engaged in by the defendant without the affirmative
and freely-given permission of the victim to the specific act of
penetration." *In re M.T.S*., *supra* at 444. A defendant, by claiming
that he had permission to engage in sexual intercourse, places his state
of mind directly in issue. The jury must then determine "whether the
defendant's belief that the alleged victim had freely given affirmative
permission was reasonable." *Id*. at 448.

The mistake of fact "defense" has been recognized by judicial decision
in some States. In 1975, the Supreme Court of California became the
first State court to recognize a mistake of fact defense in rape cases.
See *People v. Mayberry*, 15 Cal. 3d 143 (1975) (en banc). Although the
court did not make a specific determination that intent was required as
to the element of consent, it did conclude that, "if a defendant
entertains a reasonable and bona fide belief that a prosecutrix
\[*sic*\] voluntarily consented \... to engage in sexual intercourse, it
is apparent he does not possess the wrongful intent that is a
prerequisite under Penal Code section 20 to a conviction of \... rape by
means of force or threat." *Id*. at 153. Thus, the intent required is an
intent to engage in nonconsensual sexual intercourse, and the State must
prove that a defendant intentionally engaged in intercourse and was at
least negligent regarding consent.

Other State courts have employed a variety of different constructions in
adopting the mistake of fact defense. See *State v. Smith*, 210 Conn.
132, 142 (1989) ("We arrive at that result, however, not on the basis of
our penal code provision relating to a mistake of fact \... but on the
ground that whether a complainant should be found to have consented
depends upon how her behavior would have been viewed by a reasonable
person under the surrounding circumstances"); *State v. Koonce*, 731
S.W.2d 431, 437 n.2 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987) (construing rape statute to
require defendant acted at least recklessly as to consent).

However, the minority of States sharing our view is significant. See
*People v. Witte*, 115 Ill. App. 3d 20, 26 n.2 (1983) ("whether the
defendant intended to commit the offenses without the victim's consent
is not relevant, the critical question being whether the victim did, in
fact, consent. This involves her mental state, not the defendant's");
*State v. Christensen*, 414 N.W.2d 843, 845-846 (Iowa 1987)
("Defendant's awareness of a putative sexual abuse victim's lack of
consent is not an element of third-degree sexual abuse.... It follows
from this premise that a defendant's mistake of fact as to that consent
would not negate an element of the offense"); *State v. Reed*, 479 A.2d
1291, 1296 (Me. 1984) ("The legislature, by carefully defining the sex
offenses in the criminal code, and by making no reference to a culpable
state of mind for rape, clearly indicated that rape compelled by force
or threat requires no culpable state of mind"); *State v. Ayer*,
*supra*; *Commonwealth v. Williams*, 294 Pa. Super. 93, 100 (1982) ("The
crux of the offense of rape is force and lack of \[the\] victim's
consent.... When one individual uses force or the threat thereof to have
sexual relations with a person \... and without the person's consent he
has committed the crime of rape"). See also *People v. Hale*, 142 Mich.
App. 451, 453 (1985); *State v. Elmore*, 54 Wash. App. 54, 56 (1989);
*Brown v. State*, 59 Wis. 2d 200, 213-214, (1973). This case does not
persuade us that we should recognize a mistake of fact as to consent as
a defense to rape in *all* cases. See *Commonwealth v. Ascolillo*,
*supra* at 463. Whether such a defense might, in some circumstances, be
appropriate is a difficult question that we may consider on a future
case where a defendant's claim of reasonable mistake of fact is at least
arguably supported by the evidence. This is not such a case.

*Judgments affirmed*.

1 The defendant proposed the following instruction: "If the Commonwealth
has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not
motivated by a reasonable and honest belief that the complaining witness
consented to sexual intercourse, you must find the defendant not
guilty."

4 In the case before us, the Commonwealth's evidence of force consisted
of physical force, as described by the victim and corroborated by
medical examination. The trial judge properly instructed as to the
amount of force necessary to support a conviction. The judge, in
essence, gave the model jury instruction as to the required element of
force. We quote the model instruction, in pertinent part:

"The second element the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt is that the natural or unnatural sexual intercourse was
accomplished by force or by threat of bodily injury and against the
complainant's will. The force needed for rape may, depending on the
circumstances, be constructive force, as well as physical force,
violence or threat of bodily harm."

5 Since that time, the Supreme Court of California has retreated from
its original holding and steadily has eroded the defense. Today, the
defense is available only if there is "substantial evidence of equivocal
conduct that would have led a defendant to reasonably and in good faith
believe consent existed where it did not." People v. Williams, 4 Cal.
4th 354, 362 (1992). Thus, as a threshold matter, the judge, not the
jury, must find that the evidence with respect to consent is equivocal.
Unless this showing is made, the "jury will be foreclosed from
considering evidence that the defendant honestly and reasonably believed
that there was consent, even if that jury would have credited such
evidence." Cavallaro, supra at 852. This requirement, in effect,
virtually eliminates the mistake of fact doctrine because "those
defendants who, as a factual matter, would present the strongest mistake
case, by testifying to conduct that could be characterized as
'unequivocal,' are precluded by the rule of Williams from presenting
that defense to the jury." Id. at 838. On the other hand, a "defendant
who describes an encounter in which the complainant's conduct was
admittedly equivocal as to consent essentially concedes that point and
is doomed to almost certain conviction." Id. at 838-839. In the present
case, there was no evidence of equivocal conduct. The complaining
witness testified that she had told the defendant, repeatedly and
explicitly, that she did not want any form of sexual contact; that she
tried to get away from the defendant; and that she cried during the
forced intercourse. The defendant testified that the complaining witness
was the one to initiate intimate contact; that she participated
actively; and that she suggested they get together again later that
evening.

 

 

 

Commonwealth v. Berkowitz

 

 

Superior Court of Pennsylvania

415 Pa. Super. 505, 609 A.2d 1338 (1992)

PER CURIAM:

Appellant appeals from judgment of sentence imposed following
convictions of rape and indecent assault. We are called upon to
determine the degree of physical force necessary to complete the act of
rape in Pennsylvania. We find that under the totality of the
circumstances, evidence of sufficient force was not adduced herein. ...
Accordingly, we discharge appellant on the rape conviction and reverse
and remand for a new trial on the indecent assault conviction.

In the spring of 1988, appellant and the victim were both college
sophomores at East Stroudsburg State University, ages twenty and
nineteen years old, respectively. They had mutual friends and
acquaintances.... During a one day jury trial held on September 14,
1988, the victim gave the following account during direct examination by
the Commonwealth. At roughly 2:00 on the afternoon of April 19, 1988,
after attending two morning classes, the victim returned to her
dormitory room. There, she drank a martini to "loosen up a little bit"
before going to meet her boyfriend, with whom she had argued the night
before. Roughly ten minutes later she walked to her boyfriend's
dormitory lounge to meet him. He had not yet arrived.

Having nothing else to do while she waited for her boyfriend, the victim
walked up to appellant's room to look for Earl Hassel, appellant's
roommate. She knocked on the door several times but received no answer.
She therefore wrote a note to Mr. Hassel, which read, "Hi Earl, I'm
drunk. That's not why I came to see you. I haven't seen you in a while.
I'll talk to you later, \[victim's name\]." She did so, although she had
not felt any intoxicating effects from the martini, "for a laugh."

After the victim had knocked again, she tried the knob on the
appellant's door. Finding it open, she walked in. She saw someone lying
on the bed with a pillow over his head, whom she thought to be Earl
Hassel. After lifting the pillow from his head, she realized it was
appellant. She asked appellant which dresser was his roommate's. He told
her, and the victim left the note.

Before the victim could leave appellant's room, however, appellant asked
her to stay and "hang out for a while." She complied because she "had
time to kill" and because she didn't really know appellant and wanted to
give him "a fair chance." Appellant asked her to give him a back rub but
she declined, explaining that she did not "trust" him. Appellant then
asked her to have a seat on his bed. Instead, she found a seat on the
floor, and conversed for a while about a mutual friend. No physical
contact between the two had, to this point, taken place.

** **Thereafter, however, appellant moved off the bed and down on the
floor, and "kind of pushed \[the victim\] back with his body. It wasn't
a shove, it was just kind of a leaning-type of thing." Next appellant
"straddled" and started kissing the victim. The victim responded by
saying, "Look, I gotta go. I'm going to meet \[my boyfriend\]." Then
appellant lifted up her shirt and bra and began fondling her. The victim
then said "no."

After roughly thirty seconds of kissing and fondling, appellant "undid
his pants and he kind of moved his body up a little bit." The victim was
still saying "no" but "really couldn't move because \[appellant\] was
shifting at \[her\] body so he was over \[her\]." Appellant then tried
to put his penis in her mouth. The victim did not physically resist, but
rather continued to verbally protest, saying "No, I gotta go, let me
go," in a "scolding" manner.

Ten or fifteen more seconds passed before the two rose to their feet.
Appellant disregarded the victim's continual complaints that she "had to
go," and instead walked two feet away to the door and locked it so that
no one from the outside could enter.

Then, in the victim's words, "\[appellant\] put me down on the bed. It
was kind of like---he didn't throw me on the bed. It's hard to explain.
It was kind of like a push but no. . . ." She did not bounce off the
bed. "It wasn't slow like a romantic kind of thing, but it wasn't a fast
shove either. It was kind of in the middle."

Once the victim was on the bed, appellant began "straddling" her again
while he undid the knot in her sweatpants. He then removed her
sweatpants and underwear from one of her legs. The victim did not
physically resist in any way while on the bed because appellant was on
top of her, and she "couldn't like go anywhere." She did not scream out
at anytime because, "\[i\]t was like a dream was happening or
something."

Appellant then used one of his hands to "guide" his penis into her
vagina. At that point, after appellant was inside her, the victim began
saying "no, no to him softly in a moaning kind of way . . . because it
was just so scary." After about thirty seconds, appellant pulled out his
penis and ejaculated onto the victim's stomach.

Immediately thereafter, appellant got off the victim and said, "Wow, I
guess we just got carried away." To this the victim retorted, "No, we
didn't get carried away, you got carried away." The victim then quickly
dressed, grabbed her school books and raced downstairs to her boyfriend
who was by then waiting for her in the lounge.

Once there, the victim began crying. Her boyfriend and she went up to
his dorm room where, after watching the victim clean off appellant's
semen from her stomach, he called the police....

In Pennsylvania, the crime of rape is defined by statute as follows:

A person commits a felony of the first degree when he engages in sexual
intercourse with another person not his spouse:

\(1\) by forcible compulsion;

\(2\) by threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by
a person of reasonable resolution;

\(3\) who is unconscious; or

\(4\) who is so mentally deranged or deficient that such person is
incapable of consent.

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3121. A statutory caveat to this rule may be found in
section 3107 of title 18.

Resistance Not Required

The alleged victim need not resist the actor in prosecution under this
chapter: Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be
construed to prohibit a defendant from introducing evidence that the
alleged victim consented to the conduct in question.

... Before us is not a case of mental coercion. There existed no
significant disparity between the ages of appellant and the victim. They
were both college sophomores at the time of the incident. Appellant was
age twenty; the victim was nineteen. The record is devoid of any
evidence suggesting that the physical or mental condition of one party
differed from the other in any material way. Moreover, the atmosphere
and physical setting in which the incident took place was in no way
coercive. The victim walked freely into appellant's dorm room in the
middle of the afternoon on a school day and stayed to talk of her own
volition. There was no evidence to suggest that appellant was in any
position of authority, domination or custodial control over the victim.
Finally, no record evidence indicates that the victim was under
duress....

Even in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the victim's
testimony as to the physical aspects of the encounter cannot serve as a
basis to prove "forcible compulsion." The cold record is utterly devoid
of any evidence regarding the respective sizes of either appellant or
the victim. As such, we are left only to speculate as to the coercive
effect of such acts as "leaning" against the victim or placing the
"weight of his body" on top of her. This we may not do.... Moreover,
even if the record indicated some disparity in the respective weights or
strength of the parties, such acts are not themselves inconsistent with
consensual relations. Except for the fact that appellant was on top of
the victim before and during intercourse, there is no evidence that the
victim, if she had wanted to do so, could not have removed herself from
appellant's bed and walked out of the room without any risk of harm or
danger to herself whatsoever. These circumstances simply cannot be
bootstrapped into sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion....

The only evidence which remains to be considered is the fact that both
the victim and appellant testified that throughout the encounter, the
victim repeatedly and continually said "no." Unfortunately for the
Commonwealth, under the existing statutes, this evidence alone cannot
suffice to support a finding of "forcible compulsion."...

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the evidence adduced by the
Commonwealth was insufficient to convict appellant of rape, and that a
new trial is warranted on the indecent assault charge.

 

 

 

State in the interest of M.T.S.

 

New Jersey Supreme Court

609 A.2d 1266 (N.J. 1992)

HANDLER, J.

Under New Jersey law a person who commits an act of sexual penetration
using physical force or coercion is guilty of second-degree sexual
assault. The sexual assault statute does not define the words "physical
force." The question posed by this appeal is whether the element of
"physical force" is met simply by an act of non-consensual penetration
involving no more force than necessary to accomplish that result.

That issue is presented in the context of what is often referred to as
"acquaintance rape." The record in the case discloses that the juvenile,
a seventeen-year-old boy, engaged in consensual kissing and heavy
petting with a fifteen-year-old girl and thereafter engaged in actual
sexual penetration of the girl to which she had not consented. There was
no evidence or suggestion that the juvenile used any unusual or extra
force or threats to accomplish the act of penetration.

The trial court determined that the juvenile was delinquent for
committing a sexual assault. The Appellate Division reversed the
disposition of delinquency, concluding that non-consensual penetration
does not constitute sexual assault unless it is accompanied by some
level of force more than that necessary to accomplish the penetration.
We granted the State's petition for certification.

I

... On Monday, May 21, 1990, fifteen-year-old C.G. was living with her
mother, her three siblings, and several other people, including M.T.S.
and his girlfriend. A total of ten people resided in the three-bedroom
town-home at the time of the incident. M.T.S., then age seventeen, was
temporarily residing at the home with the permission of the C.G.'s
mother; he slept downstairs on a couch. C.G. had her own room on the
second floor. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on May 21, C.G. went upstairs
to sleep after having watched television with her mother, M.T.S., and
his girlfriend. When C.G. went to bed, she was wearing underpants, a
bra, shorts, and a shirt. At trial, C.G. and M.T.S. offered very
different accounts concerning the nature of their relationship and the
events that occurred after C.G. had gone upstairs. The trial court did
not credit fully either teenager's testimony.

C.G. stated that earlier in the day, M.T.S. had told her three or four
times that he "was going to make a surprise visit up in \[her\]
bedroom." She said that she had not taken M.T.S. seriously and
considered his comments a joke because he frequently teased her. She
testified that M.T.S. had attempted to kiss her on numerous other
occasions and at least once had attempted to put his hands inside of her
pants, but that she had rejected all of his previous advances.

C.G. testified that on May 22, at approximately 1:30 a.m., she awoke to
use the bathroom. As she was getting out of bed, she said, she saw
M.T.S., fully clothed, standing in her doorway. According to C.G.,
M.T.S. then said that "he was going to tease \[her\] a little bit." C.G.
testified that she "didn't think anything of it"; she walked past him,
used the bathroom, and then returned to bed, falling into a "heavy"
sleep within fifteen minutes. The next event C.G. claimed to recall of
that morning was waking up with M.T.S. on top of her, her underpants and
shorts removed. She said "his penis was into \[her\] vagina." As soon as
C.G. realized what had happened, she said, she immediately slapped
M.T.S. once in the face, then "told him to get off \[her\], and get
out." She did not scream or cry out. She testified that M.T.S. complied
in less than one minute after being struck; according to C.G., "he
jumped right off of \[her\]."....

** **C.G. said that after M.T.S. left the room, she "fell asleep crying"
because "\[she\] couldn't believe that he did what he did to \[her\]."
She explained that she did not immediately tell her mother or anyone
else in the house of the events of that morning because she was "scared
and in shock." According to C.G., M.T.S. engaged in intercourse with her
"without \[her\] wanting it or telling him to come up \[to her
bedroom\]." By her own account, C.G. was not otherwise harmed by M.T.S.

At about 7:00 a.m., C.G. went downstairs and told her mother about her
encounter with M.T.S. earlier in the morning and said that they would
have to "get \[him\] out of the house." While M.T.S. was out on an
errand, C.G.'s mother gathered his clothes and put them outside in his
car; when he returned, he was told that "\[he\] better not even get near
the house." C.G. and her mother then filed a complaint with the police.

According to M.T.S., he and C.G. had been good friends for a long time,
and their relationship "kept leading on to more and more." He had been
living at C.G.'s home for about five days before the incident occurred;
he testified that during the three days preceding the incident they had
been "kissing and necking" and had discussed having sexual intercourse.
The first time M.T.S. kissed C.G., he said, she "didn't want him to, but
she did after that." He said C.G. repeatedly had encouraged him to "make
a surprise visit up in her room."

M.T.S. testified that at exactly 1:15 a.m. on May 22, he entered C.G.'s
bedroom as she was walking to the bathroom. He said C.G. soon returned
from the bathroom, and the two began "kissing and all," eventually
moving to the bed. Once they were in bed, he said, they undressed each
other and continued to kiss and touch for about five minutes. M.T.S. and
C.G. proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse. According to M.T.S., who
was on top of C.G., he "stuck it in" and "did it \[thrust\] three times,
and then the fourth time \[he\] stuck it in, that's when \[she\] pulled
\[him\] off of her." M.T.S. said that as C.G. pushed him off, she said
"stop, get off," and he "hopped off right away."

According to M.T.S., after about one minute, he asked C.G. what was
wrong; she replied with a back-hand to his face. He recalled asking C.G.
what was wrong a second time, and her replying, "how can you take
advantage of me or something like that." M.T.S. said that he proceeded
to get dressed and told C.G. to calm down, but that she then told him to
get away from her and began to cry. Before leaving the room, he told
C.G., "I'm leaving . . . I'm going with my real girlfriend, don't talk
to me . . . I don't want nothing to do with you or anything, stay out of
my life . . . don't tell anybody about this . . . it would just screw
everything up." He then walked downstairs and went to sleep.

On May 23, 1990, M.T.S. was charged with conduct that if engaged in by
an adult would constitute second-degree sexual assault of the victim,
contrary to *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1)....

Following a two-day trial on the sexual assault charge, M.T.S. was
adjudicated delinquent. After reviewing the testimony, the court
concluded that the victim had consented to a session of kissing and
heavy petting with M.T.S. The trial court did not find that C.G. had
been sleeping at the time of penetration, but nevertheless found that
she had not consented to the actual sexual act. Accordingly, the court
concluded that the State had proven second-degree sexual assault beyond
a reasonable doubt. On appeal, following the imposition of suspended
sentences on the sexual assault and the other remaining charges, the
Appellate Division determined that the absence of force beyond that
involved in the act of sexual penetration precluded a finding of
second-degree sexual assault. It therefore reversed the juvenile's
adjudication of delinquency for that offense.

II

The New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1), defines
"sexual assault" \[in relevant part as follows: "c. An actor is guilty
of sexual assault if he commits an act of sexual penetration with
another person under any one of the following circumstances: (1) The
actor uses physical force or coercion, but the victim does not sustain
severe personal injury ...."\] An unconstrained reading of the statutory
language indicates that both the act of "sexual penetration" and the use
of "physical force or coercion" are separate and distinct elements of
the offense. *See Medical Soc. v. Department of Law & Pub. Safety*, 120
*N.J.* 18, 26, 575 *A.*2d 1348 (1990) (declaring that no part of a
statute should be considered meaningless or superfluous). Neither the
definitions section of *N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-1 to -8, nor the remainder of
the Code of Criminal Justice provides assistance in interpreting the
words "physical force." The initial inquiry is, therefore, whether the
statutory words are unambiguous on their face and can be understood and
applied in accordance with their plain meaning. The answer to that
inquiry is revealed by the conflicting decisions of the lower courts and
the arguments of the opposing parties. The trial court held that
"physical force" had been established by the sexual penetration of the
victim without her consent. The Appellate Division believed that the
statute requires some amount of force more than that necessary to
accomplish penetration.

** **The parties offer two alternative understandings of the concept of
"physical force" as it is used in the statute. The State would read
"physical force" to entail any amount of sexual touching brought about
involuntarily. A showing of sexual penetration coupled with a lack of
consent would satisfy the elements of the statute. The Public Defender
urges an interpretation of "physical force" to mean force "used to
overcome lack of consent." That definition equates force with violence
and leads to the conclusion that sexual assault requires the application
of some amount of force in addition to the act of penetration....

\[A\]s evidenced by the disagreements among the lower courts and the
parties, and the variety of possible usages, the statutory words
"physical force" do not evoke a single meaning that is obvious and
plain. Hence, we must pursue avenues of construction in order to
ascertain the meaning of that statutory language. Those avenues are well
charted. When a statute is open to conflicting interpretations, the
court seeks the underlying intent of the legislature, relying on
legislative history and the contemporary context of the statute.
*Monmouth County v. Wissell*, 68 *N.J.* 35, 41-42 (1975). With respect
to a law, like the sexual assault statute, that "alters or amends the
previous law or creates or abolishes types of actions, it is important,
in discovering the legislative intent, to ascertain the old law, the
mischief and the proposed remedy." *Grobart v. Grobart*, 5 *N.J.* 161,
166 (1950).... We also remain mindful of the basic tenet of statutory
construction that penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor
of the accused. Nevertheless, the construction must conform to the
intent of the Legislature.

The provisions proscribing sexual offenses ... were written against
almost two hundred years of rape law in New Jersey. The origin of the
rape statute that the current statutory offense of sexual assault
replaced can be traced to the English common law. Under the common law,
rape was defined as "carnal knowledge of a woman against her will." ...
American jurisdictions generally adopted the English view, but over time
states added the requirement that the carnal knowledge have been
forcible, apparently in order to prove that the act was against the
victim's will. As of 1796, New Jersey statutory law defined rape as
"carnal knowledge of a woman, forcibly and against her will." Crimes Act
of March 18, 1796 § 8. Those three elements of rape---carnal knowledge,
forcibly, and against her will---remained the essential elements of the
crime until 1979....

Under traditional rape law, in order to prove that a rape had occurred,
the state had to show both that force had been used and that the
penetration had been against the woman's will. ... "Thus, the
perpetrator's use of force became criminal only if the victim's state of
mind met the statutory requirement. The perpetrator could use all the
force imaginable and no crime would be committed if the state could not
prove additionally that the victim did not consent." National Institute
of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, *Forcible Rape---An Analysis of
Legal Issues* 5 (March 1978) Although the terms "non-consent" and
"against her will" were often treated as equivalent, under the
traditional definition of rape, both formulations squarely placed on the
victim the burden of proof and of action. Effectively, a woman who was
above the age of consent had actively and affirmatively to withdraw that
consent for the intercourse to be against her will. As a Delaware court
stated, "If sexual intercourse is obtained by milder means, or with the
consent or silent submission of the female, it cannot constitute the
crime of rape." *State v. Brown*, 83 A. 1083, 1084 (O.T. 1912).

The presence or absence of consent often turned on credibility. To
demonstrate that the victim had not consented to the intercourse, and
also that sufficient force had been used to accomplish the rape, the
state had to prove that the victim had resisted. According to the
oft-quoted Lord Hale, to be deemed a credible witness, a woman had to be
of good fame, disclose the injury immediately, suffer signs of injury,
and cry out for help. 1 Matthew Hale, *History of the Pleas of the
Crown* 633 (1st ed. 1847). ... Evidence of resistance was viewed as a
solution to the credibility problem...

The resistance requirement had a profound effect on the kind of conduct
that could be deemed criminal and on the type of evidence needed to
establish the crime. Courts assumed that any woman who was forced to
have intercourse against her will necessarily would resist to the extent
of her ability. In many jurisdictions the requirement was that the woman
have resisted to the utmost. "Rape is not committed unless the woman
oppose the man to the utmost limit of her power." *People v. Carey*, 223
*N.Y.* 519 (N.Y.1918). "\[A\] mere tactical surrender in the face of an
assumed superior physical force is not enough. Where the penalty for the
defendant may be supreme, so must resistance be unto the uttermost."
*Moss v. State*, 208 Miss. 531 (1950).

... In *State v. Harris*, 70 N.J. Super. 9, 174 A.2d 645 (1961), the
Appellate Division recognized that the "to the uttermost" test was
obsolete. *Id.* at 16, 174. "The fact that a victim finally submits does
not necessarily imply that she consented. Submission to a compelling
force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent." *Id.* at
16-17. Nonetheless, the "resistance" requirement remained an essential
feature of New Jersey rape law. Thus, in 1965 the Appellate Division
stated: "\[W\]e have rejected the former test that a woman must resist
'to the uttermost.' We only require that she resist as much as she
possibly can under the circumstances." *State v. Terry*, 89 *N.J.
Super.* 445....

The resistance requirement had another untoward influence on traditional
rape law. Resistance was necessary not only to prove non-consent but
also to demonstrate that the force used by the defendant had been
sufficient to overcome the victim's will. The amount of force used by
the defendant was assessed in relation to the resistance of the victim.
*See, e.g.,* Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.02 (1974) (repealed 1983)
(stating that "the amount of force necessary to negate consent is a
relative matter to be judged under all the circumstances, the most
important of which is the resistance of the female"). ... Only if she
resisted, causing him to use more force than was necessary to achieve
penetration, would his conduct be criminalized....

To refute the misguided belief that rape was not real unless the victim
fought back, reformers emphasized empirical research indicating that
women who resisted forcible intercourse often suffered far more serious
injury as a result. Menachem Amir, *Patterns in Forcible Rape*, 164-65,
169-171 (1971); *Definition of Forcible Rape, supra*, 61 Va. L. Rev. at
1506. That research discredited the assumption that resistance to the
utmost or to the best of a woman's ability was the most reasonable or
rational response to a rape.

... Reformers criticized the conception of rape as a distinctly sexual
crime rather than a crime of violence. They emphasized that rape had its
legal origins in laws designed to protect the property rights of men to
their wives and daughters. Susan Brownmiller, *Against Our Will: Men,
Women, and Rape* 377 (1975); *Acquaintance Rape: The Hidden Crime* 318
(Andrea Parrot & Laurie Bechhofer, eds. 1991). ...

Critics of rape law agreed that the focus of the crime should be shifted
from the victim's behavior to the defendant's conduct, and particularly
to its forceful and assaultive, rather than sexual, character. Reformers
also shared the goals of facilitating rape prosecutions and of sparing
victims much of the degradation involved in bringing and trying a charge
of rape. There were, however, differences over the best way to redefine
the crime. Some reformers advocated a standard that defined rape as
unconsented-to sexual intercourse; others urged the elimination of any
reference to consent from the definition of rape. Nonetheless, all
proponents of reform shared a central premise: that the burden of
showing non-consent should not fall on the victim of the crime....

Similarly, with regard to force, rape law reform sought to give
independent significance to the forceful or assaultive conduct of the
defendant and to avoid a definition of force that depended on the
reaction of the victim. Traditional interpretations of force were
strongly criticized for failing to acknowledge that force may be
understood simply as the invasion of "bodily integrity." Susan Estrich,
*Rape*, 95 *Yale L.J.* 1087, 1105 (1986). In urging that the
"resistance" requirement be abandoned, reformers sought to break the
connection between force and resistance.

III

... Since the 1978 reform, the Code has referred to the crime that was
once known as "rape" as "sexual assault." The crime now requires
"penetration," not "sexual intercourse." It requires "force" or
"coercion," not "submission" or "resistance." It makes no reference to
the victim's state of mind or attitude, or conduct in response to the
assault. It eliminates the spousal exception based on implied consent.
It emphasizes the assaultive character of the offense by defining sexual
penetration to encompass a wide range of sexual contacts, going well
beyond traditional "carnal knowledge." Consistent with the assaultive
character, as opposed to the traditional sexual character, of the
offense, the statute also renders the crime gender-neutral: both males
and females can be actors or victims.

The reform statute defines sexual assault as penetration accomplished by
the use of "physical force" or "coercion," but it does not define either
"physical force" or "coercion" or enumerate examples of evidence that
would establish those elements.... The task of defining "physical force"
therefore was left to the courts....

The Legislature's concept of sexual assault and the role of force was
significantly colored by its understanding of the law of assault and
battery. As a general matter, criminal battery is defined as "the
unlawful application of force to the person of another." 2 Wayne LaFave
& Austin Scott, *Criminal Law* § 7.15 at 301 (1986). The application of
force is criminal when it results in either (a) a physical injury or (b)
an offensive touching. *Id.* at 301-02. Any "unauthorized touching of
another \[is\] a battery." *Perna v. Pirozzi*, 92 *N.J.* 446 (1983)....

The understanding of sexual assault as a criminal battery, albeit one
with especially serious consequences, follows necessarily from the
Legislature's decision to eliminate non-consent and resistance from the
substantive definition of the offense. Under the new law, the victim no
longer is required to resist and therefore need not have said or done
anything in order for the sexual penetration to be unlawful. The alleged
victim is not put on trial, and his or her responsive or defensive
behavior is rendered immaterial....

We conclude, therefore, that any act of sexual penetration engaged in by
the defendant without the affirmative and freely given permission of the
victim to the specific act of penetration constitutes the offense of
sexual assault. Therefore, physical force in excess of that inherent in
the act of sexual penetration is not required for such penetration to be
unlawful. The definition of "physical force" is satisfied under
*N.J.S.A.* 2C:14-2c(1) if the defendant applies any amount of force
against another person in the absence of what a reasonable person would
believe to be affirmative and freely-given permission to the act of
sexual penetration.

Under the reformed statute, permission to engage in sexual penetration
must be affirmative and it must be given freely, but that permission may
be inferred either from acts or statements reasonably viewed in light of
the surrounding circumstances.... Persons need not, of course, expressly
announce their consent to engage in intercourse for there to be
affirmative permission. Permission to engage in an act of sexual
penetration can be and indeed often is indicated through physical
actions rather than words. Permission is demonstrated when the evidence,
in whatever form, is sufficient to demonstrate that a reasonable person
would have believed that the alleged victim had affirmatively and freely
given authorization to the act.

... The Legislature recast the law of rape as sexual assault to bring
that area of law in line with the expectation of privacy and bodily
control that long has characterized most of our private and public law.
*See Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Paint Oil Co.*, 129 N.J. 81, 94-96
(1992) (recognizing importance of constitutional and common-law
protection of personal privacy); *id.* at 106, 609 *A.*2d 11 (Pollock,
J., concurring) (emphasizing that common-law right of privacy protects
individual self-determination and autonomy). In interpreting "physical
force" to include any touching that occurs without permission we seek to
respect that goal....

IV

... In the context of a sexual penetration not involving unusual or
added "physical force," the inclusion of "permission" as an aspect of
"physical force" effectively subsumes and obviates any defense based on
consent. *See* N.J.S.A. 2C:2-10c(3). The definition of "permission"
serves to define the "consent" that otherwise might allow a defendant to
avoid criminal liability. Because "physical force" as an element of
sexual assault in this context requires the *absence* of affirmative and
freely given permission, the "consent" necessary to negate such
"physical force" under a defense based on consent would require the
*presence* of such affirmative and freely given permission. Any lesser
form of consent would render the sexual penetration unlawful and cannot
constitute a defense.

In this case, the Appellate Division concluded that non-consensual
penetration accomplished with no additional physical force or coercion
is not criminalized under the sexual assault statute. It acknowledged
that its conclusion was "anomalous" because it recognized that "a woman
has every right to end \[physically intimate\] activity without sexual
penetration." *Ibid.* Thus, it added to its holding that "\[e\]ven the
force of penetration might . . . be sufficient if it is shown to be
employed to overcome the victim's unequivocal expressed desire to limit
the encounter."

The Appellate Division was correct in recognizing that a woman's right
to end intimate activity without penetration is a protectable right the
violation of which can be a criminal offense. However, it misperceived
the purpose of the statute in believing that the only way that right can
be protected is by the woman's unequivocally expressed desire to end the
activity. The effect of that requirement would be to import into the
sexual assault statute the notion that an assault occurs only if the
victim's will is overcome, and thus to reintroduce the requirement of
non-consent and victim-resistance as a constituent material element of
the crime. Under the reformed statute, a person's failure to protest or
resist cannot be considered or used as justification for bodily
invasion.

We acknowledge that cases such as this are inherently fact sensitive and
depend on the reasoned judgment and common sense of judges and juries.
The trial court concluded that the victim had not expressed consent to
the act of intercourse, either through her words or actions. We conclude
that the record provides reasonable support for the trial court's
disposition.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and
reinstate the disposition of juvenile delinquency for the commission of
second-degree sexual assault.

 

 

 

People v. Giardino

 

California Court of Appeals

98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 315 (Cal. 4^th^ App. 2000)

McKINSTER, J.

... In an 11-count information, the defendant was charged with
committing rape by intoxication (Pen. Code, § 261, subd. (a)(3)) in
counts 1, 2, and 3; with committing oral copulation by intoxication (§
288a, subd. (i)) in counts 4 and 5; with committing oral copulation with
a minor (§ 288a, subd. (b)(1)) in counts 6 and 7; with ... unlawful
sexual intercourse (§ 261.5) in counts 8, 9 and 10; and with molesting a
child (§ 647.6) in count 11. The jury found him guilty as charged in
counts 2 through 7 and 9 through 11, but not guilty as to counts 1 and
8. In addition to a prison term of 13 years and 2 restitution fines, the
defendant was ordered to pay restitution to the victim in the sum of
\$7,359.

The defendant contends that the convictions on counts 2 through 5 must
be reversed because the trial court erred (1) by refusing to instruct
the jury that lack of consent is an element of the charges of rape by
intoxication and oral copulation by intoxication, (2) by failing to
instruct the jury concerning the meaning of "prevented from resisting,"
and (3) by failing to instruct the jury concerning the effect of an
honestly and reasonably held but mistaken belief in the victim's ability
to give legal consent. He contends that those same counts must also be
reversed because there is insufficient evidence to support a finding
that the victim was unable to physically resist....

*A. Lack of Actual Consent Is Not an Element of Rape by Intoxication*.

The defendant asked the trial court to give a "consent instruction"
regarding the charges of rape by intoxication and oral copulation by
intoxication. In his oral request, the defendant did not describe the
requested instruction in any detail, but the trial court interpreted him
to be asking that the jury be instructed either that lack of consent was
an element of those crimes or that consent is a defense. The trial court
refused to do so.

Reasoning that lack of consent is an element of rape, or conversely that
consent is a defense, the defendant contends that the trial court should
have defined consent in accordance with section 261.6 and instructed the
jury that lack of consent is an element of the offenses of rape by
intoxication and oral copulation by intoxication. He is mistaken.

In the context of rape and other sexual assaults, "consent" is defined
as the "positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise
of free will." (§ 261.6.) To give consent, a "person must act freely and
voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction
involved." (*Ibid*.; accord, CALJIC No. 1.23.1.) In short, that
definition describes consent that is actually and freely given without
any misapprehension of material fact. We shall refer to this as "actual
consent." \[*In a footnote, the court added*: Actual consent must be
distinguished from submission. For instance, a victim's decision to
submit to an attacker's sexual demands out of fear of bodily injury is
not consent ... because the decision is not freely and voluntarily made.
A selection by the victim of the lesser of two evils---rape versus the
violence threatened by the attacker if the victim resists---is hardly an
exercise of free will.\]

By itself, the existence of actual consent is not sufficient to
establish a defense to a charge of rape. That the supposed victim
actually consented to sexual intercourse disproves rape only if he or
she had "sufficient capacity" to give that consent. See *People v.
Mayberry* (1975) 15 Cal. 3d 143, 154. For example, if the victim is so
unsound of mind that he or she is incapable of giving legal consent, the
fact that he or she may have given actual consent does not prevent a
conviction of rape.... Hence, the consent defense fails if the victim
either did not actually consent or lacked the capacity to give legally
cognizable consent.

The distinction between actual consent and legal consent is further
illustrated by the statutory definition of rape. Some of the various
means of committing rape specified in the subdivisions of section 261
deal with the lack of the victim's actual consent while others deal with
the victim's lack of capacity, i.e., with the lack of legal consent.

In the context of rape, "against the victim's will" is synonymous with
"without the victim's consent." *People v. Cicero* (1984) 157 Cal. App.
3d 465, 480.Therefore, by specifically referring to intercourse
accomplished against the victim's will, subdivisions (a)(2) (force or
duress), (a)(6) (threat of retaliation), and (a)(7) (threat of detention
or deportation) of section 261 describe instances in which the victim
has not actually consented. The same is true when the victim is not
aware of the nature of the act (*id*., subd. (a)(4)(C)) or has been
deceived into believing that the defendant is the victim's spouse
(*id*., subd. (a)(5)). In those cases, there is no actual consent
because the victim lacks "knowledge of the nature of the act or
transaction ...." (§ 261.6.) By contrast, subdivision (a)(1) of section
261 proscribes sexual intercourse with a person who lacks the capacity
to give legal consent due to a mental disorder or a developmental or
physical disability.

That distinction determines the instructions that are relevant to the
charge. A charge that the defendant accomplished the act of sexual
intercourse against the will of the victim, together with evidence that
places in dispute the willingness of the victim to engage in
intercourse, entitles the defendant to an instruction that the act was
not criminal if it was committed with the victim's actual consent. But
if the charge is that the victim lacked the capacity to give legal
consent (such as § 261, subd. (a)(1)), then actual consent is
irrelevant, and the jury instructions need not touch on that issue.

Unlike subdivisions (a)(2), (a)(6), and (a)(7) of section 261, section
261(a)(3) *\[rape-by-intox\]* is not phrased in terms of the victim's
"will." Nor does it employ the words "legal consent," as does
subdivision (a)(1) \[*i.e., statutory rape*\]. Instead, section
261(a)(3) speaks in terms of the victim being "prevented from resisting
...." Does that subdivision pertain to the victim's actual consent or to
the victim's ability to give legal consent?

Although the language of section 261(a)(3) suggests that the victim's
actual consent is at issue, our Supreme Court long ago rejected that
notion. In discussing the elements of rape of a mentally incompetent
person, the court said: "In this species of rape neither force upon the
part of the man, nor resistance upon the part of the woman, forms an
element of the crime. If, by reason of any mental weakness, she is
incapable of legally consenting, resistance is not expected any more
than it is in the case of one who has been drugged to unconsciousness,
or *robbed of judgment by intoxicants*." *People v. Griffin*, 117 Cal.
at 585, italics added.

This emphasis on the effect of the intoxicants on the victim's powers of
judgment rather than the victim's powers of resistance is consistent
with the Model Penal Code, which provides that actual consent is not
legal consent if "it is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental
disease or defect, or intoxication is manifestly unable or known by the
actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or
harmfulness of the conduct ...." Model Pen. Code, § 2.11(3)(b).

We conclude that, just as subdivision (a)(1) of section 261 proscribes
sexual intercourse with a person who is not capable of giving legal
consent because of a mental disorder or physical disability, section
261(a)(3) proscribes sexual intercourse with a person who is not capable
of giving legal consent because of intoxication. In both cases, the
issue is not whether the victim actually consented to sexual
intercourse, but whether he or she was capable of exercising the degree
of judgment a person must have in order to give legally cognizable
consent.

In reaching that conclusion, we reject the defendant's contrary, more
literal construction of section 261(a)(3). He notes that, prior to a
1980 amendment, the rape-by-force subdivision of section 261 expressly
required evidence of resistance by the victim.... Resistance was
required to provide "an objective indicator of non-consent,"
corroborating the victim's testimony that the act of intercourse was
undertaken against the victim's will. *People v. Barnes* (1986) 42 Cal.
3d 284, 299. In accordance with that purpose, the degree of resistance
required "was only that which would reasonably manifest refusal to
consent to the act of sexual intercourse." *Id.* at 297. The defendant
asserts that, with that understanding of "resistance," it follows that
"prevented from resisting" in section 261(a)(3) means that the victim is
so intoxicated that he or she was physically incapable of manifesting a
refusal to actually consent.

That construction is untenable. The case law interpreting the former
resistance requirement demonstrates that the exertion of physical force
by the victim against the defendant was not required; verbal
protestations alone were sufficient to establish resistance. See, e.g.,
*People v. Peckham* (1965) 232 Cal. App. 2d 163, 165-168 .... Therefore,
to be intoxicated to a degree that rendered the victim physically unable
to resist would mean that the victim was unable to even speak. The line
between that extreme level of intoxication and absolute unconsciousness
is very thin. There is no indication in our decisional law that section
261(a)(3) has ever been interpreted to apply only to such severely
incapacitated victims.

For instance, the evidence in *People v. Ing*, (1967) 65 Cal. 2d 603,
was that the defendant, a medical doctor, had administered injections to
the victim on several occasions; that after receiving the shots, the
victim felt "'light-headed'" and "'just didn't care about anything,'"
*id*. at p. 607; that the doctor would then have intercourse with her;
and that she would not have engaged in intercourse with him had she not
been under the influence of the drugs. There was apparently no evidence
that the victim was unable to speak or otherwise communicate a refusal
to consent; indeed, the evidence suggested that the victim actually
consented to intercourse. Nevertheless, the court summarily rejected the
defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his
rape convictions. *Id*. at 612....

Because section 261(a)(3) proscribes sexual intercourse with a person
who is not capable of giving legal consent because of intoxication, the
lack of actual consent is not an element of the crime. Accordingly, the
trial court properly denied the defendant's request for an instruction
to the contrary.

*B. The Trial Court Prejudicially Erred by Failing to Explain to the
Jury the Meaning of "Prevented from Resisting."*

... \[T\]he jury was instructed that one of the elements of rape by
intoxication was that "the alleged victim was prevented from resisting
the act by an intoxicating substance ...." \[*verbatim from §
261(a)(3)*\] In an apparent reference to that instruction, after several
hours of deliberation the jury asked the court for the legal definition
of "resistance." ...

... As demonstrated by its request for a definition of "resistance," the
jury was having difficulty grasping the import of the statutory
language, and understandably so.... As we explained in part A of this
opinion, although the statutory language suggests that the factual issue
is whether the intoxicating substance prevented the victim from
physically resisting, the correct interpretation focuses on whether the
victim's level of intoxication prevented him or her from exercising
judgment.

The defendant was entitled to have that concept correctly explained,
especially after the jury requested clarification of that very subject.
In particular, the jury should have been instructed that its task was to
determine whether, as a result of her level of intoxication, the victim
lacked the legal capacity to give "consent" as that term is defined in
section 261.6. Legal capacity is the ability to exercise reasonable
judgment, i.e., to understand and weigh not only the physical nature of
the act, but also its moral character and probable consequences.

 In deciding whether the level of the victim's intoxication deprived the
victim of legal capacity, the jury shall consider all the circumstances,
including the victim's age and maturity. It is not enough that the
victim was intoxicated to some degree, or that the intoxication reduced
the victim's sexual inhibitions. "Impaired mentality may exist and yet
the individual may be able to exercise reasonable judgment with respect
to the particular matter presented to his or her mind." *People v.
Peery*, 26 Cal. App. at 145. Instead, the level of intoxication and the
resulting mental impairment must have been so great that the victim
could no longer exercise reasonable judgment concerning that issue. \[*A
footnote added*: In one sense, a minor is always legally incapable of
giving consent. But here the defendant was being prosecuted not only for
unlawful sexual intercourse but also for the greater crime of rape by
intoxication. In that event, the jury must set aside the statutory
presumption that a person under 18 years of age is incapable of giving
legal consent and must determine whether the elements of the more
serious crime are met.\]

The trial court's response to the jury's inquiry did not help the jury
to focus on the victim's ability to exercise that judgment. To the
contrary, by instructing the jury "to determine the everyday meaning of
resistance," the trial court erroneously implied that the meaning of the
statute could be deciphered by giving the language of the statute its
common meaning, and thus that the issue was the victim's ability to
resist....

As with any other instructional error, a "violation of section 1138 does
not warrant reversal unless prejudice is shown." *People v. Beardslee,*
53 Cal. 3d at 97. This error did prejudice the defendant because the
evidence supports conflicting conclusions regarding the victim's
capacity.

Norliza G. lived with her mother and stepfather, the defendant. On
December 27, 1996, Norliza's friend, the victim, was spending the night
at Norliza's house. The victim had recently turned 16 years old.

The victim testified that, on December 27, she consumed a single drink
of bourbon over ice that the defendant had poured for her. She variously
described the drink as filling a 12-inch-tall glass "a little more than
halfway," and as being in a glass "a couple inches taller than a coke
can" filled to a level "a little more than half of a coke can." Norliza
testified that the victim had two drinks, the first poured by the
defendant and the second poured by the victim herself. Norliza estimated
the total amount of bourbon consumed by the victim to be five ounces.

** **According to the victim, she felt "woozy, very lightheaded" after
consuming the alcohol. She slipped and fell while walking in the living
room of the defendant's house. Explaining that the victim had not had
anything to eat, Norliza testified that the victim became "very giggly,"
slurred her speech, could not walk straight, and generally "wasn't
altogether there." Norliza saw her fall several times. Thomas Lyles
testified that the victim appeared to be "kind of tipsy" and later was
clumsy and obviously intoxicated. However, she was never so intoxicated
that she was close to passing out, that she did not know what she was
doing, or that she could not physically resist....

Lyles and the defendant said that they needed to get the victim out of
the house to sober her up. She told the defendant that she did not want
to leave the house, but he pulled her by the arm to his car. Lyles was
with them.... The defendant stopped at a Motel 6 and rented a room. The
victim stepped out of the car and the three of them climbed the stairs
to the third floor motel room. Because she was so intoxicated, Lyles and
the defendant were holding her by each arm to assist her up the stairs.
Despite their help, as a result of the alcohol she tripped and fell on
her knees near the top of the stairs. The defendant's testimony
characterized her as being "pretty giddy" at this point.

The victim testified that, once in the motel room, she walked into the
bathroom, disrobed, and started to take a shower. The defendant pulled
her out of the shower, saying "we don't have time for this." The victim
began to get dressed....

The victim testified that after she had put on only the shirt, the
defendant called to her. She came out of the bathroom to find both men
naked. She began walking toward the door, and said, "I thought we were
going home?" Lyles initially testified that she said something about
wanting to go home, but later testified that she said, "Let's get some
liquor and have sex all night." Similarly, the defendant testified that
as soon as she had disrobed, she came out of the bathroom and climbed
onto one of the beds.

The victim testified that, in response to her comment about going home,
the defendant said, "No. I want you to ride Tom." The defendant then
pulled the victim by the arm on top of Lyles, who was lying down. While
engaging in intercourse with Lyles, the defendant told her, "I want you
to suck me." She then began to orally copulate the defendant. The
defendant then took the victim to the other bed and pulled her on top of
him. While engaging in intercourse with the defendant, the victim orally
copulated Lyles. She testified that, during this time, she "was
conscious a little bit." She felt like she "was just doing what they
were saying to do."

The defendant then turned the victim on her back and again engaged in
intercourse. While in that position, the defendant took a bottle of Rush
(amyl nitrite inhalant), poured some onto a washcloth, and put it over
the victim's face. She tried to hold her breath and push his hands away.
Lyles recalled that she also told the defendant to stop applying it to
her face.

** **After the defendant ejaculated, he got up, started to dress, and
instructed the victim to do the same. She was able to dress herself. As
she was walking out, she still felt wobbly and light-headed, but she
walked down the stairs without assistance. The defendant drove her to
the corner of the block on which he lived and she walked the rest of the
way to Norliza's house....

The victim testified that she did not resist the defendant's actions
that night because he was a lot bigger than she was, because she was
afraid of him, and because she was intoxicated. Lyles testified that she
never said she did not want to have sex. She never said "no," "don't,"
"stop," or anything else indicating that she did not consent. To the
contrary, she said that she wanted to engage in sexual relations.
According to the defendant, it did not appear that the victim was so
drunk that she did not know what she was doing or that "she was
prevented mentally from resisting."

The victim spent that night and the next day with Norliza at the
defendant's house. At no time did she display any animosity toward Lyles
or the defendant or express any displeasure to the defendant concerning
the events of the prior evening.

Whether the victim possessed sufficient mental capacity to give legal
consent despite her intoxication is a question of fact for the jury.
Here, there is evidence from which the jury could have concluded that
the victim was not capable of exercising reasonable judgment, but there
is also evidence from which it could have concluded that she was
capable. She voiced her objections both to leaving the house and to
inhaling the Rush. Although unsteady on her feet, the victim was able to
walk and to undress herself. To Lyles and the defendant, she appeared in
the motel to be sober enough to make decisions. Shortly after engaging
in the intercourse found by the jury, she dressed herself and walked
down several flights of stairs unassisted. When she returned to the
house, she was not drunk. And the next day, after she presumably was
utterly sober, she amicably associated with both the defendant and Lyles
without indicating in any fashion that she would have made different
decisions the night before had she not been under the influence of
alcohol.

In short, there is substantial evidence both that the victim actually
consented and that she possessed the legal capacity to do so. There
being evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the victim
was not so intoxicated that she was deprived of the ability to exercise
reasonable judgment, the trial court's erroneous failure to properly
instruct the jury concerning the elements of section 261(a)(3) cannot be
deemed to have been harmless. The conviction on counts 2 through 5 must
be reversed.

*C. An Honest and Reasonable but Mistaken Belief That a Sexual Partner
Is Not Too Intoxicated to Give Legal Consent to Sexual Intercourse Is a
Defense to Rape by Intoxication*.

... The Supreme Court explained in *People v. Hernandez* that, unless
the particular criminal statute at issue expresses a legislative intent
or policy to impose strict criminal liability, a defendant's conduct is
punished as a crime only if it was committed with the necessary criminal
intent. 61 Cal. 2d 529, at 532-33. "There can be no dispute that a
criminal intent exists when the perpetrator proceeds \[to engage in
sexual intercourse\] with utter disregard of, or in the lack of grounds
for, a belief that the female has reached the age of consent. But if he
participates in a mutual act of sexual intercourse, believing his
partner to be beyond the age of consent, with reasonable grounds for
such belief, where is his criminal intent?" *Id*. at p. 534. The court
concluded that a reasonable and "bona fide but erroneous belief that a
valid consent to an act of sexual intercourse has been obtained" is a
defense to a charge of statutory rape. *Id*. at p. 535.

The same reasoning controls when the sexual partner's consent is invalid
because of a lack of capacity due to brain damage rather than minority.
(*People v. Dolly* (1966) 239 Cal. App. 2d 143, 146.) It also controls
in this context, in which the lack of capacity is due to intoxication.
As section 261(a)(3) itself provides, the accused is guilty only if the
victim's incapacitating level of intoxication "was known, or reasonably
should have been known by the accused." An honest and reasonable but
mistaken belief that a sexual partner is not too intoxicated to give
legal consent to sexual intercourse is a defense to rape by
intoxication. ...

The convictions on counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11 are reversed.... All other
aspects of the judgment are affirmed....

 

 

 

Notes on capacity to consent, intoxication, and social duties

 

**1. Jury instructions on consent, mistake, and intoxication**

For another formulation of the law regarding a victim's capacity to
consent, see *Mass. Superior Court Criminal Jury Instruction § 3.1.1*:

In this case, there has been evidence that the complainant had consumed
alcohol \[or drugs\]. If, because of the consumption of drugs or alcohol
or for some other reason (for example, sleep, unconsciousness,
intellectual disability, or helplessness), a person is so impaired as to
be incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, then intercourse
occurring during such incapacity is without that person\'s consent.

If you find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the complainant was so impaired as to be incapable of consenting as
I have just described, and if you further find that the Commonwealth has
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew, or reasonably
should have known, that the complainant\'s condition rendered her
incapable of consenting, then the Commonwealth has proved the element of
lack of consent, and, on the element of force, the Commonwealth need
only prove that the defendant used the degree of force necessary to
accomplish the sexual intercourse---that is, to effect penetration. In
determining whether the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that the defendant should have reasonably known that the
complainant was incapable of consenting, you should examine whether a
reasonable person, in the circumstances known to the defendant, would
have known the complainant was incapable of consent.

Recall that a defendant's own intoxication is generally not admissible
to show that he lacked general intent (and, in many states, specific
intent). But intent to act is distinct from knowledge of the
circumstances in which one acts. A reasonable mistake about, or
ignorance of, a victim's lack of consent might be a defense to rape.
See, e.g., *Mass. Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions §
5.11:*

You may consider whether a reasonable person in the defendant\'s
situation, considering all of the circumstances, could have been
reasonably mistaken about whether \[the complainant\] consented to any
touching that the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If,
after considering all of the evidence you have a reasonable doubt as to
whether a person in the defendant\'s situation reasonably could have
been mistaken about whether \[the complainant\] consented to the
touching at issue, you must find the defendant not guilty.

What if "the defendant's situation" includes the defendant's own
intoxication at the time, and the defendant argues that he himself was
so intoxicated that he was unable to know, or recognize, that the victim
could not consent? In *Commonwealth v. Mountry*, 463 Mass. 80, 972
N.E.2d 438 (Mass. 2012), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held:

\[I\]n a rape prosecution in which the Commonwealth must prove that a
defendant knew or reasonably should have known that a victim\'s
condition rendered him or her incapable of consenting, and where there
is credible evidence of a defendant\'s mental impairment, a defendant is
entitled to the jury\'s consideration of his mental condition as it
relates to his ability to possess the requisite knowledge.

... The Commonwealth had to prove what \"*the defendant* reasonably
should have known\" (emphasis added), not what the average reasonable
unintoxicated person would have known. A defendant\'s impaired state of
mind is relevant to the jury\'s determination of this element....
\[T\]he judge should have instructed the jury that the Commonwealth must
prove that in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable
person would have known that the victim was incapable of consent, and
that when deciding whether the Commonwealth has met its burden of proof,
they could consider any credible evidence that the defendant was
affected by the voluntary consumption of alcohol.

To confirm your understanding of the foregoing, consider:

-   What are two ways (arising from two different scenarios) that
    prosecutors can prove a rape victim's lack of consent?

-   Why does the law provide a defendant with a reasonable mistake of
    fact defense regarding a victim's non-consent in some cases but not
    others?

***Was It O.K. to Leave a Drunken Woman With a Stranger?***

Kwame Anthony Appiah, [NY
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/magazine/was-it-ok-to-leave-a-drunken-woman-with-a-stranger.html)
Magazine (Ethicist), 7/28/19

*\[In response to a question of whether it is ethical to leave an
intoxicated acquaintance in a nightclub without other friends there,
taking with a stranger:\]*

There are people who say that consent can be given in any state short of
incapacitation, which is, indeed, the law in many states.
("Incapacitation" suggests that you're drifting in and out of
consciousness; that you don't know what's happening, whom you're with,
how you got there.) There are people who say that sex under the
influence of alcohol is always wrong. Neither is a plausible position.

Memoirs about drinking are one place where you find people thinking hard
about alcohol and agency. ""I drank myself to a place where I didn't
care, but I woke up a person who cared enormously. Many yeses on Friday
night would have been noes on Saturday morning." Sarah Hepola wrote in
her powerful book
"[Blackout](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/books/review-sarah-hepolas-blackout-on-the-darkness-that-took-over-her-life.html?module=inline)."
Were those yeses therefore less than consensual? Not in her view. She
chafes against the notion that the bad actor who provides you with
drinks got you drunk, as she wrote in [Texas
Monthly](https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/the-alcohol-blackout/),
and insists, "I'd gotten myself drunk." One reason the issue of sex
under the influence is complicated is that people often imbibe for its
expected consequences---they seek a lessening of inhibition.

"We found sex compelling and terrifying and foreign, and drank to deal
with it," Caroline Knapp recalled in her own memoir, "[Drinking: A Love
Story](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/13/books/books-of-the-times-two-lives-one-lost-to-alcoholism-and-the-other-surviving-it.html?module=inline)."
She wrote: "A naturally inhibited person, someone who grew up feeling
mystified and insecure about what it meant to feel sexual, I turned to
liquor the way a dancer turns toward music: It felt central to the
process, central to my ability to shut down the voices of self-criticism
in my own head and simply let go."

These are authors who struggled with alcoholism; they were hardly
commending their decisions, or the way they turned to booze or what
booze provided them. But they were clear that going home with someone
you wouldn't have otherwise gone home with doesn't mean you've been
assaulted. "The reason I liked getting drunk," Hepola wrote, "was
because it altered my consent: It changed what I would say yes to."

Somewhere in the gradient of intoxication, between the glass or two of
wine at dinner to outright incapacitation, consent becomes attenuated.
Yet there's little agreement about when. Our ideas of consent derive
from our ideas of autonomy --- and those ideas become complicated when
we take steps that we know will affect our decision making. That happens
in benign contexts: You go out to a karaoke night knowing you'd never
sing karaoke without a couple of beers in you. And it happens in more
consequential ones.

Where to draw the line? I can imagine various approaches. One would
focus on the continuity of self: If a person drinks, up to a certain
point, she might make decisions she otherwise wouldn't --- and yet
afterward she can still tell a coherent narrative about herself, as a
subject with beliefs, desires and intentions that are intelligible to
her when she's sober. She can replay her decisions and remember why she
made them, even if she wouldn't make them now. That continuity of self
would be violated if she became blackout drunk and woke up with a
stranger. The stranger, we can feel, should have known that she was in
no condition to be making any decisions.

But whatever approach we try, none of them will mark a precise point on
the road from buzzed to blotto. As an ethical matter, moreover, you want
to avoid making bad decisions, or letting others make bad decisions,
even when consent isn't at issue. When your judgment is impaired by
alcohol, you're more likely to engage in risky sexual activity, more
likely to expose yourself to S.T.D.s, unwanted pregnancy and more.

Which brings us to your second question. When is it a good idea, or
possibly even a duty, to intervene in order to protect a stranger? In
this case, a reason for restraint is that, as you note, it can be
disrespectful to question a fellow adult's decisions. Still, when
someone is seriously intoxicated, her right to manage her own life is
lessened by her diminished capacity. (Condescension would be in play
only if you were treating her as incompetent when she wasn't.) And the
fact that she might be only 21 carries weight, too. Her experience with
drinking and drunkenness might not be comparable to that of someone a
few years older.

Another reason not to intervene might be that there is someone else who
has a duty to do so. In this case, that duty might lie, ethically
speaking, with the bar and its staff members. So pointing out to them
that she was drunk would have been a good idea. So-called "dram shop"
laws make establishments potentially liable for some of the bad
consequences of serving alcohol to visibly intoxicated people. Telling
bartenders that a customer is drunk often gives them a reason to stop
serving them. This would only leave you off the hook, though, if you
thought that they would act on your information, and you had doubts
about that.

It's worth noting that, contrary to the assumptions people often make,
the fact that the musician wasn't drunk is a good thing, because it
means he was more likely to exercise sound judgment. (Our minds run to
the calculating predator and his impaired victim, but statistically,
alcohol use by the perpetrator is a big risk factor.) You evidently
struck up a conversation with the student in which you learned her name
and her circumstances --- that's a good thing, too. But yes, you would
have done well to say something to the musician, conveying your concern
for the young woman. A subtle sense of being in the public view can make
it more likely that people will behave the way they know they ought to.

 

 

 

State v. Smith

 

Kansas Court of Appeals

39 Kan. App. 2d 204, 178 P.3d 672 (2008)

GREENE, J.: Jesse Smith appeals his conviction and sentence for rape,
arguing insufficiency of the evidence, error in the admission of certain
evidence, error in applying the rape shield statute, instruction error,
cumulative trial error, and sentencing error. We reject Smith's
challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. We conclude, however, that
the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as to
voluntary intoxication, but we conclude the error was harmless. Smith's
remaining claims of error are rejected; thus, we affirm his
conviction....

On July 14, 2004, S.L. met Smith, her friend of 5 months, to have dinner
and "a couple drinks." She considered him merely a friend, had no sexual
or romantic interest in him, and was then dating another man. After
dinner, they visited several bars and consumed a large quantity of beer;
on the way home, S.L. passed out in Smith's vehicle. Upon arrival, Smith
indicated it was not safe for her to drive and offered his bedroom,
promising to sleep on the couch. Before she retired, however, she
invited Smith to sleep on one side of the bed, but she did not intend to
have sex with him.

According to S.L., she awakened in the night and felt something on her
hips but went back to sleep until she awoke and discovered she had
nothing on from the waist down. She also discovered what looked to be
semen with a black pubic hair on her genital area. She tiptoed back to
the bedroom, grabbed her clothes, and left....

The next day, colleagues of S.L. urged her to see a physician, and the
physician urged her to go to the hospital for an exam. Her father took
her to the hospital, where she was examined and spoke to police about
the incident.

Smith was charged with one count of rape in contravention of K.S.A.
21-3502(a)(1)(C), proscribing the act of sexual intercourse without
consent under circumstances where the victim is incapable of giving a
valid consent due to the effect of alcoholic liquor or narcotic drug,
which condition is known by the defendant or reasonably apparent.

At trial, Smith testified that he went to sleep on the couch and did not
remember anything else until he awoke the next morning. Smith requested
an instruction on voluntary intoxication, but the district court refused
to give the instruction and, instead, instructed the jury that
"voluntary intoxication is not a defense to a charge of rape." Smith was
found guilty by the jury, and he was sentenced to 184 months'
imprisonment. He timely appeals.

*Was the Evidence Sufficient to Support Smith's Conviction of Rape?*

On appeal, Smith argues the evidence was insufficient to sustain his
conviction because the State did not prove S.L. was unable to give
consent and the State did not prove Smith had knowledge she was unable
to give consent or that this was reasonably apparent. These arguments
fail....

Smith was charged and convicted of rape in contravention of K.S.A.
21-3502(a)(1)(C), which provides:

"(a) Rape is (1) sexual intercourse with a person who does not consent
to the sexual intercourse, under any of the following
circumstances: ....

"(C) when the victim is incapable of giving consent because of mental
deficiency or disease, or when the victim is incapable of giving consent
because of the effect of any alcoholic liquor, narcotic, drug or other
substance, which condition was known by the offender or was reasonably
apparent to the offender."

To sustain Smith's conviction the State needed to prove:

-   Smith had sexual intercourse with S.L.;

-   the act of sexual intercourse was committed without the consent of
    S.L. by reason of her inability to give consent, which was either
    known by Smith or was reasonably apparent to him; and

-   the act occurred on or about July 15, 2004.

With regard to Smith's challenge to the evidence of S.L.'s condition,
our review of the evidence shows that she was approximately 5' 6" tall,
weighed 117 pounds, drank 6 to 8 beers on the evening in question, and
passed out from drinking. She unequivocally testified that she never
gave consent to Smith to have sexual intercourse and would not have done
so. Our Supreme Court has declined to define the degree of intoxication
required to sustain a rape conviction under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1)(C) and
has stated that "\[l\]ay persons are familiar with the effects of
alcohol. If the jury concluded \[the victim\] was drunk enough to be
unable to consent to sex, we should give great deference to that
finding." *State v. Chaney*, 269 Kan. 10, 20, 5 P.3d 492 (2000).

With regard to Smith's challenge to the evidence of his knowledge of
S.L.'s condition, our review of the evidence shows that Smith told her
she was too intoxicated to drive home and that she should stay at his
residence for the night. Moreover, S.L. testified that Smith did not
attempt to wake her or otherwise seek consent before performing sexual
intercourse. From this evidence, a reasonable inference can be drawn
that Smith had knowledge that S.L. was unable to consent due to
intoxication or that it was reasonably apparent to him....

Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we
believe a rational jury could have found that S.L. was too intoxicated
to give consent and that Smith had knowledge of this condition, or that
it was reasonably apparent, and could therefore convict him beyond a
reasonable doubt of the offense charged. We reject Smith's challenge to
the sufficiency of the evidence for these reasons.

*Did the District Court Err in Refusing to Instruct that Voluntary
Intoxication is a Defense to this Charge?*

Smith next argues that the district court erred in refusing his request
to instruct the jury on his defense of voluntary intoxication....

The State argues that rape does not require specific intent on the part
of the defendant ..., and that a defendant may not assert voluntary
intoxication as a defense unless a particular intent or state of mind is
a necessary element of the crime charged, citing *State v. Gonzales*,
253 Kan. 22, 23, 853 P.2d 644 (1993)....

Smith argues, however, that K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1)(C) is unlike the other
statutory proscriptions of rape in that it requires knowledge by the
defendant that the victim is incapable of giving consent. He argues
generally that our Supreme Court has acknowledged that voluntary
intoxication is a proper defense in a situation where the defendant is
not conscious of what he was doing and therefore incapable of forming
the requisite state of mind for the knowledge element of the crime,
citing *State v. Ludlow*, 256 Kan. 139, 883 P.2d 1144 (1994).

Our research reflects that our Supreme Court has not faced the precise
issue framed by this appeal, *i.e.*, whether the knowledge requirement
of K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1)(C) justifies a voluntary intoxication defense.
Even though rape has generally been held to be a crime of general
intent, we do not find a case addressing the question in the context of
the precise statutory subsection at issue here....

Based upon the statutory language, rape where the victim is unable to
consent due to intoxication clearly requires, as an element of the
offense, that the defendant have knowledge of this aspect of the
victim's condition, or that this condition was reasonably apparent to
him. This knowledge element is above and beyond whatever general intent
may be required for the prohibited act of sexual intercourse....

K.S.A. 21-3208 codifies the defense of voluntary intoxication. It
states:

"(1) The fact that a person charged with a crime was in an intoxicated
condition at the time the alleged crime was committed is a defense only
if such condition was involuntarily produced and rendered such person
substantially incapable of knowing or understanding the wrongfulness of
his conduct and of conforming his conduct to the requirements of law.

"(2) An act committed while in a state of voluntary intoxication is not
less criminal by reason thereof, but *when a particular intent or other
state of mind is a necessary element to constitute a particular crime,
the fact of intoxication may be taken into consideration in determining
such intent or state of mind*." (Emphasis added.)

We must determine whether the knowledge element of K.S.A.
21-3502(a)(1)(C), *i.e.*, "which condition \[the victim's intoxication\]
was known by the offender or was reasonably apparent to the offender" is
an "other state of mind" under K.S.A. 21-3208 such that voluntary
intoxication should have been recognized as a defense. We answer this
question in the affirmative.

Our Supreme Court has provided a helpful discussion of "state of mind"
for purposes of K.S.A. 21-3208 in *Ludlow*, 256 Kan. at 144-45. The
court cited Black's Law Dictionary, which now defines "state of mind" as
"the condition or capacity of a person's mind" or "a person's reasons or
motive for committing an act, esp\[ecially\] a criminal act." Black's
Law Dictionary 1446 (8th ed. 2004). Most notably for our purposes is the
court's reference with apparent approval to *United States v. Feola*,
420 U.S. 671 (1975), where the Court noted the absence in a certain
federal criminal statute of "*any requirement for a particular state of
mind such as 'knowingly'*" in holding that in order to incur criminal
liability under the statute, the actor must entertain merely a general
criminal intent. (Emphasis added.) See *State v. Farris*, 218 Kan. 136,
143, 542 P.2d 725 (1975). The corollary of this principle is that when a
criminal statute *contains* a clear knowledge element, the crime
proscribed requires a particular state of mind and makes it subject to a
voluntary intoxication defense.

We recognize, however, that general criminal intent may be established
by proof of intentional conduct, and that the term "knowingly" is
included within the term "intentional" for these purposes. K.S.A.
21-3201. Nevertheless, when a criminal statute expressly requires
specific knowledge of the victim's condition, above and beyond any
general intent to commit the prohibited act, we believe this requirement
is beyond any more general knowledge requirement for criminal intent.
The distinction between a general intent crime and a crime of specific
intent is whether, in addition to the intent required by K.S.A. 21-3201,
the statute defining the crime in question identifies or requires a
further particular intent which must accompany the prohibited act. See
*State v. Sterling*, 235 Kan. 526, 528, 680 P.2d 301 (1984).

Examining K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1)(C), the prohibited act is sexual
intercourse with a victim incapable of giving consent, but the statute
requires a *further* state of mind of the offender, *i.e.*, knowledge of
that condition if not reasonably apparent. This is a state of mind that
is beyond the general criminal intent required for rape. Accordingly, we
conclude the knowledge requirement of K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1)(C) justified
a voluntary intoxication defense, and Smith was entitled to have the
jury so instructed.

The erroneous instruction does not require reversal, however, because
our review of the whole record shows that substantial justice has been
done. K.S.A. 60-2105 requires that we disregard technical errors and
irregularities which do not affirmatively appear to have prejudicially
affected the substantial rights of the party complaining, where it
appears upon the whole record that substantial justice has been done by
the judgment. Moreover, even if Smith's claim was elevated to a
constitutional deprivation, we need not reverse his judgment where the
evidence of guilt is of such a direct and overwhelming nature that it
cannot be said the error could have affected the result of the trial.
See *State v. Denney*, 258 Kan. 437, 445, 905 P.2d 657 (1995).

Here, the evidence against Smith was indeed overwhelming. He testified
that he was aware of S.L.'s inability to drive home, and he then drove
her to his house. S.L. had passed out in his car, and he woke her upon
reaching his house. He told the interviewing officer that he remembers
telling an officer of brushing his teeth, taking his contacts out, and
going to sleep. He also remembers being invited by S.L. to sleep on one
side of the bed, but he claims to recall nothing thereafter, despite the
clear DNA evidence of sexual intercourse with S.L. The fact that he
remembers other details renders somewhat incredible his claim that he
has no memory whatsoever of sexual intercourse with S.L. And, most
damning, is the testimony of L.S. (detailed below), who testified to
identical conduct by Smith, and which led to sexual intercourse with her
after a night of mutual voluntary intoxication.

Reviewing all of this evidence, we conclude that the instruction error
could not have affected the outcome of Smith's trial, and we therefore
reject his contention that he is entitled to a new trial.

*Did the District Court Err in Admitting Evidence of Defendant's Earlier
Conduct, Contrary to K.S.A. 60-455?*

Smith also argues that the district court erred in allowing a witness,
L.S., to testify regarding Smith's conduct on another occasion that was
similar to his purported conduct against S.L. The district court allowed
the evidence on the grounds it showed plan and absence of mistake or
accident....

Prior to trial the State moved to present the testimony of L.S., who
testified at trial that in December 2000 she was out with a group of
people including Smith, when the group decided to go to a bar. They
stayed until it closed, and she was very drunk. She was unable to drive
home, so Smith suggested she come over to his house. He offered her the
bed, agreeing to sleep on the couch. She did not remember how she got to
Smith's apartment, but she remembered passing out once in Smith's bed.
She awakened to find Smith having sexual intercourse with her, but was
unable to move or speak. She testified that she did not consent in any
manner to Smith's conduct, but she made no formal complaint of his
conduct. They subsequently became a couple, lived together, and became
engaged before breaking up in September 2003.

In examining a K.S.A. 60-455 challenge to evidence of prior bad acts,
our standard of review requires threshold determinations that (1) the
evidence is relevant to one or more of the statutory exceptional facts
(motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or
absence of mistake or accident); and (2) the fact was a disputed
material fact in the trial. *State v. Tiffany*, 267 Kan. 495, 498, 986
P.2d 1064 (1999). Here the evidence was clearly relevant to show motive,
intent, plan, and absence of mistake or accident. We note that to show
plan or modus operandi under 60-455, the evidence of the prior conduct
must be so strikingly similar or so distinct to the allegations before
the court that it is reasonable to conclude the same individual
committed both acts. *State v. Jones*, 277 Kan. 413, 421, 85 P.3d 1226
(2004). Here, we view the evidence presented by L.S. as so distinct a
method of operation and so similar to that alleged by S.L. that it
appears, indeed, to be strikingly similar.

Was motive, intent, plan, or absence of mistake or accident a disputed
material fact in Smith's trial? Smith's defense was that he, too, was
intoxicated and just did not remember having sex with L.S. This defense
is potentially undermined by evidence of motive, intent, plan, and
absence of mistake or accident. Particularly because we have held that
the offense requires an element of knowledge or state of mind, and Smith
challenged this element, and the fact that Smith may have intended or
planned the entire encounter, thus negating any mistake or accident,
enhanced the materiality of this evidence.

We conclude that ... the district court did not err in allowing the
testimony of L.S...

*Summary and Conclusion*

We reject Smith's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to
support his conviction, together with all other claims of trial error,
with the exception of the refusal of the district court to instruct on
the defense of voluntary intoxication. This error does not entitle Smith
to a new trial, however, because overwhelming evidence supports his
conviction....

**\[ ... \]**

JUSTICE NELSON

delivered the Opinion of the Court.

**\[ ... \]**On January 8,1999, the District Court for the Thirteenth
Judicial District, Yellowstone County, issued an Order denying Bonnie
Kuntz's motion to dismiss or strike an amended information. The amended
information alleged, under one charge, that Kuntz negligently caused the
death of Warren Becker by stabbing and then failing to call for medical
assistance. Kuntz contended that her affirmative defense ofjustifiable
use of force nullified any conceivable duty she had to render aid to
Becker following the stabbing, and therefore the portion of the
information pertaining to her failure to summon medical aid should be
amended or stricken. In denying Kuntz's motion, the District Court
stated that because Kuntz may have had such a duty, both she and the
State would be permitted to argue whether her "actions after the
stabbing tend to refute her claim of justification." Kuntz sought a writ
of supervisory control and the State concurred. In an order dated March
23,1999, this Court accepted original jurisdiction at the request of
both parties. This Court concluded that the criteria set forth in Rule
17, M.R.App.P. and *Plumb v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Court* (1996), 279
Mont. 363, 927 P.2d 1011, were satisfied and that legal questions raised
were ones of first impression.

¶**\[ ... \]**

¶3 According to the amended information and supporting affidavit,
Yellowstone County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched on April 19, 1998,
to the home of Bonnie Kuntz and Warren Becker to investigate a reported
stabbing. When the deputies arrived at the trailer house, Becker was
dead from a single stab wound to the chest.

¶4 Kuntz, who was waiting for medical and law enforcement personnel to
arrive, told the deputies that she and Becker had argued the morning of
April 18,1998. At some point during the day, both parties left the
trailer home. After Kuntz returned that evening, at or before midnight,
a physical altercation ensued.

¶5 The alleged facts indicate that Kuntz and Becker, who had never
married but had lived together for approximately six years, were in the
process of ending what is described as a stormy relationship. When Kuntz
arrived at the mobile home that night, she discovered that many of her
personal belongings had been destroyed, the interior of the home
"trashed," and the phone ripped from the wall. Kuntz told the deputies
that she then went into the kitchen. There, allegedly, Becker physically
attacked her, and at one point grabbed her by the hair, shook her, and
slammed her into the stove.

¶6 Kuntz told the deputies that she could not clearly remember what
happened, only that she had pushed Becker away and had then gone outside
by the kitchen door to "cool off." When she thought that the fight was
over, and that it was safe to go back inside, she returned to the
kitchen. She discovered a trail of blood leading from the kitchen
through the living room and out onto the front porch where she found
Becker collapsed face-down on the porch. She alleges that she rolled him
over. Becker was unresponsive.

¶7 Kuntz then alleges that she found Becker's car keys in one of his
pockets, got in his vehicle, drove to a friend's house several miles
away, and called her mother. Kuntz does not allege that she personally
contacted medical or law enforcement personnel; rather, authorities were
apparently summoned by Kuntz's sister-in-law, who lived next door to
Kuntz's mother, sometime within an hour after the stabbing. Kuntz did
return, however, to the trailer home where she waited for the deputies
and medics to arrive.

¶8 On June 23,1998, Bonnie Kuntz was charged with negligent homicide for
causing the death of Warren Becker by stabbing him once in the chest.
Although she admitted stabbing Becker and causing his death, Kuntz
entered a plea of not guilty based on the defense of justifiable use of
force.

¶9 On November 6,1998, shortly before the scheduled trial date, the
State filed an amended information charging the same offense but
alleging that Kuntz caused the death of Becker by stabbing him once in
the chest with a knife *and* by failing to call for medical assistance.
Kuntz again entered a plea of not guilty. On December 18, 1998, Kuntz
filed a motion to dismiss the amended information or in the alternative
to strike the allegation that the failure to seek medical assistance
constituted negligent homicide.

¶10 Following a hearing and briefing, the District Court issued an Order
andMemorandum on January 8,1999, denying Bonnie Kuntz's motion to
dismiss the amended information.

**\[ ... \]**

¶14 For criminal liability to be based upon a failure to act, there must
be a duty imposed by the law to act, and the person must be physically
capable of performing the act. *See* § 45-2-202, MCA. As a starting
point in our analysis, the parties here have identified what is often
referred to as "the American bystander rule." This rule imposes no legal
duty on a person to rescue or summon aid for another person who is at
risk or in danger, even though society recognizes that a moral
obligation might exist. This is true even "when that aid can be rendered
without danger or inconvenience to" the potential rescuer. *Pope v.
State* (Md. 1979), 396 A.2d 1054, 1064 (quoting Wayne R. LaFave & Austin
W. Scott, Jr., Criminal Law, at 183 (1972)). Thus, an Olympic swimmer
may be deemed by the community as a\' shameful coward, or worse, for not
rescuing a drowning child in the neighbor's pool, but she is not a
criminal. *See* LaFave & Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 3.3(a)
(1986).

¶15 But this rule is far from absolute. Professors LaFave and Scott have
identified seven common-law exceptions to the American bystander
rule: 1) a duty based on a personal relationship, such as parent-child
or husband-wife; 2) a duty based on statute; 3) a duty based on
contract; 4) a duty based upon voluntary assumption of care; 5) a duty
based on creation of the peril; 6) a duty to control the conduct of
others; and 7) a duty based on being a landowner. *See* LaFave & Scott,
§ 3.3, at 283-289. A breach of one of these legal duties by failing to
take action, therefore, may give rise to criminal liability. Our review
of the issues presented here can accordingly be narrowed to two of the
foregoing exceptions as briefed by the parties and identified by the
District Court: 1) a duty based on a personal relationship, and 2) a
duty based on creation of the peril.

¶16 One of the lead authorities on the personal relationship duty arose
in Montana. In the widely-cited case of *State v. Mally* (1961), 139
Mont. 599, 366 P.2d 868, this Court held that under certain
circumstances a husband has a duty to summon medical aid for his wife
and breach of that duty could render him criminally liable. The facts of
the case described how Kay Mally, who was suffering from terminal kidney
and liver diseases, fell and fractured both her arms on a Tuesday
evening. Her husband, Michael Mally, put her to bed and did not summon a
doctor until Thursday morning. "During this period of time, as she lay
there with only the extended arm of death as a companion, she received
but one glass of water." *Mally,* 139 Mont. at 608, 366 P.2d at 873.
Although his wife ultimately died of kidney failure, Mally was found
guilty of involuntary manslaughter, a forerunner of Montana's negligent
homicide statute, because his failure to act hastened his wife's death.
*See Mally,* 139 Mont. at 610, 366 P.2d at 874. *See also Territory v.
Manton* (1888), 8 Mont. 95, 19 P. 387 (finding husband criminally
culpable for leaving intoxicated and inadequately clothed wife outside
in winter conditions overnight). *But see State v. Decker* (1971), 157
Mont. 361, 365-66, 485 P.2d 695, 698 (reversing involuntary manslaughter
conviction of husband who, after finding his intoxicated wife
unconscious on barroom floor, put her to bed and failed to summon
medical aid until the next morning).

¶17 In *Mally,* however, we alluded to a limitation of this rule which
is a point of contention between the parties here. We cited to *People
v. Beardsley* (Mich. 1907), 113 N.W. 1128, which is favorably cited by
Amicus. The Michigan Supreme Court concluded that the legal duty imposed
on the personal relationship of husband and wife could not be extended
to a temporary, non-family relationship. The court held that a married
defendant had no duty to summon medical help for his mistress, who was
staying in his house for the weekend, after she took morphine following
a bout of heavy drinking and fell into a "stupor." *Beardsley,* 113 N.W.
at 1131.

¶18 We agree with the State, as well as myriad commentators over the
years, that although not expressly disfavored in case law, *Beardsley*
is indeed "outmoded," at least to the extent it should be distinguished.
*See, e.g.,* Note, *Criminal Omissions,* 55 Harv. L. Rev. 615, 625
(1942) (suggesting that the law should protect the expectation found in
certain personal relationships that "in an emergency a limited faith or
trust will be honored"); Graham Hughes, *Criminal Omissions,* 67 Yale L.
J. 590, 624 (1958) (stating that *Beardsley* "proclaims a morality which
is smug, ignorant and vindictive"); Arthur Leavens, *A Causation
Approach to Criminal Omissions,* 76 Calif. L. Rev. 547, 561 (1988)
(criticizing the *Beardsley* court's "crimped" reading of legal duty).
*See also State v. Miranda* (Conn. 1998), 715 A.2d 680, 682 (concluding
that person who is not biological or legal parent of a child but who
establishes a "familial relationship" with live-in girlfriend has duty
to protect child from abuse); *Leet v. State* (Fla. App. 1991), 595
So.2d 959, 963 *\[same\].*

¶ 19 Applying the foregoing to the facts here, we conclude that Kuntz
and Becker, having lived together for approximately six years, owed each
other the same "personal relationship" duty as found between spouses
under our holding in *Mally.* This duty, identified as one of "mutual
reliance" by LaFave and Scott, would include circumstances involving
"two people, though not closely related, \[who\] live together under one
roof." LaFave & Scott, § 3.3(a)(1), at 285-286. To hold otherwise would
result in an untenable rule that would not, under the factual
circumstances found in *Mally,* impose a legal duty to summon medical
aid on persons in a relationship involving cohabitation. Nevertheless,
this holding is far from dispositive in establishing a legal duty under
the facts presented.

¶20 We agree with the District Court that the duty based on "creation of
the peril" is far more closely aligned with the factual circumstances
here. Undoubtedly, when a person places another in a position of danger,
and then fails to safeguard or rescue that person, and the person
subsequently dies as a result of this omission, such an omission may be
sufficient to support criminal liability. *See* LaFave & Scott, §
3.3(a)(5), at 288; *State v. Morgan* (Wash.App. 1997), 936 P.2d 20, 23
(imposing criminal liability for supplying cocaine leading to victim's
overdose); *United States v. Hatatley* (10th Cir. 1997), 130 F.3d 1399,
1406 (imposing criminal liability for leaving victim badly beaten and
shirtless in a freezing, remote desert).

¶21 This duty may include peril resulting from a defendant's criminal
negligence, as alleged here. *See generally Molly,* 139 Mont. at 606,
366 P.2d at 872 (stating that failure to obtain medical aid for one who
is owed a duty is a sufficient degree of negligence as to constitute
involuntary manslaughter). **\[ ... \]**

¶22 The legal duty based on creation of the peril has been extended in
other jurisdictions to cases involving self-defense. *See King v.
Commonwealth* (Ky. App. 1941), 148 S.W.2d 1044; *People v. Fowler* (Cal.
1918), 174 P. 892, 896, *overruled on other grounds by People v. Thomas*
(Cal. 1945), 156 P.2d 7. A clear, conclusive articulation of the legal
duty to render or summon medical aid following an act of self-defense,
however, was not established in either of these cases.

¶23 The court in *King,* for example, reversed a conviction of voluntary
manslaughter that was based on the appellant's refusal to give or permit
others to give aid or medical attention. The court, in finding that jury
instructions were improper and prejudicial, stated:

> \[Sjince the shooting was justified, appellant could not have been
> guilty of voluntary or involuntary manslaughter unless he had
> committed *some subsequent act* which converted a non-fatal injury
> into a fatal one. If the injury was fatal, nothing which appellant
> might have done could have changed the result, or lessened or
> increased his responsibility.

*King,* 148 S.W.2d at 1047 (emphasis added). The facts do not reveal how
the use of force came about, only that the appellant shot the decedent
in the leg with a shotgun in the "necessary defense of appellant's
father." *King,* 148 S.W.2d at 1046. Following the shooting, the Kings
(father and son) carried the victim to their front porch and, futilely,
attempted to stop the bleeding. The Kings did not have access to a phone
or an automobile. Consequently, "\[s\]ome hours elapsed before the
first-aid man and the constable arrived, and about 11:30 A.M. an
automobile was procured \[approximately five hours after the
shooting\]." *King,* 148 S.W.2d at 1046. Even though evidence showed
that a physician could have been summoned more speedily, and that the
appellant's father acted somewhat indifferently to the shooting victim's
plight, the court concluded that the Rings had not committed a
"subsequent act" in that they did not actually refuse to render or seek
medical attention for the victim, and thus could not have been found
guilty of voluntary manslaughter, which required an unlawful, willful
act. *King,* 148 S.W.2d at 1046-47.

**\[ ... \]**

¶25 As *King* and Fowler suggest, the legal duty imposed on personal
relationships and those who create peril are not absolute; i.e., there
are exceptions to these exceptions. The personal relationship legal
duty, for example, does not require a person to jeopardize his own life.
*See Matty,* 139 Mont. at 605, 366 P.2d at 871 (quoting *Beardsley). See
also State v. Walden* (N.C. 1982), 293 S.E.2d 780, 786 (stating that
although a parent has a legal duty to prevent harm to his or her child,
"\[t\]his is not to say that parents have the legal duty to place
themselves in danger of death or great bodily harm in coming to the aid
of their children"). Furthermore, the duty does not arise unless the
spouse "unintentionally entered a helpless state," or was otherwise
incompetent to summon medical aid on his or her own behalf.
*Commonwealth v. Konz* (Pa. 1982), 450 A.2d 638, 642 (citing *Matty).*

¶26 Similarly, the law does not require that a person, who places
another person in a position of peril, risk bodily injury or death in
the performance of the legally imposed duty to render assistance. **\[
... \]**

¶27 Therefore, where self-preservation is at stake, the law does not
require a person to "save the other's life by sacrificing his own," and
therefore no crime can be committed by the person who "in saving his own
life in the struggle for the only means of safety," causes the death of
another. 40 Am.Jur. *Homicide* § 116 (1999) (analyzing self-preservation
in situations involving common peril). Even states such as Vermont that
have adopted a "Good Samaritan Doctrine" which --- contrary to the
American bystander rule --- imposes a legal duty to render or summon aid
for imperiled strangers, do not require that the would-be rescuer risk
bodily injury or death. *See, e.g., State v. Joyce* (Vt. 1981), 433 A.2d
271, 273 (holding that Vermont's Duty to Aid the Endangered Act did not
require bystanders to intervene in a fight, because such intervention
would expose person to risk of sustaining an injury). Thus, although a
person may still be held accountable for the results of the peril into
which he or she placed another, the law does not require that he or she
risk serious bodily injury or death in order to perform a legal duty.

¶28 With these general principles in place, we now turn to the issues
subject to the writ of supervisory control.

Issue 1.

Does one who justifiably uses deadly force in defense of her person
nevertheless have a legal duty to summon aid for the mortally wounded
attacker?

¶29 Our analysis of this issue is narrowed to whether the legal duty to
summon aid, based on the defendant's personal relationship or creation
of peril, extends into circumstances where the defendant's alleged use
of justifiable force places his or her aggressor in need of medical
attention. The State contends that even if Kuntz's use of force was
justified, a proven subsequent failure by her to summon aid could
constitute a gross deviation from ordinary care. Thus, the State's
amended information charging Kuntz with negligent homicide for stabbing
Becker and then failing to immediately call for medical assistance was
proper and should not be stricken. Although the use of force may be
justified, to not hold such a person criminally accountable for the
subsequent omission would, according to the State, "encourage revenge
and retaliation."

¶30 Whether inflicted in self-defense or accidentally, a wound that
causes a loss of blood undoubtedly places a person in some degree of
peril, and therefore gives rise to a legal duty to either 1) personally
provide assistance; or 2) summon medical assistance. *See Flippo v.
State* (Ark. 1975), 523 S.W.2d 390, 393-94 (affirming involuntary
manslaughter conviction of hunters for failing to timely summon aid
following shooting accident). Even so, the performance of this legal
duty, as discussed above, does not require that a person place herself
at risk of serious bodily injury or death. *See Mally,* 139 Mont. at
605, 366 P.2d at 871; *Yockel v. Gerstadt* (Md. App. 1928), 140 A. 40,
42 (stating that "\[u\]nder any and all circumstances the law places
upon a man the duty of exercising reasonable care for his own
protection").

¶31 Accordingly, based on che legal principles gleaned from our analysis
thus far, we hold that when a person justifiably uses force to fend off
an aggressor, that person has no duty to assist her aggressor in any
manner that may conceivably create the risk of bodily injury or death to
herself, or other persons. This absence of a duty necessarily includes
any conduct that would require the person to remain in, or return to,
the zone of risk created by the original aggressor. We find no authority
that suggests that the law should require a person, who is justified in
her use of force, to subsequently check the pulse of her attacker, or
immediately dial 9-1-1, before retreating to safety.

¶32 Under the general factual circumstances described here, we conclude
that the victim has but one duty after fending off an attack, and that
is the duty owed to one's self --- as a matter of self-preservation ---
to seek and secure safety away from the place the attack occurred. Thus,
the person who justifiably acts in self-defense is temporarily afforded
the same status as the innocent bystander under the American rule. *See
Pope,* 396 A.2d at 1064 (stating general rule); LaFave & Scott, §
3.3(a)(5), at 288 (suggesting that "one who innocently creates danger is
on principle in the same position as that of a bystander who happens by
when a situation of danger has. developed").

¶33 Finally, we conclude that the duty to summon aid may in fact be
"revived" as the State contends, but only after the victim of the
aggressor has fully exercised her right to seek and secure safety from
personal harm. Then, and only then, may a legal duty be imposed to
summon aid for the person placed in peril by an act of self-defense. We
further hold that preliminary to imposing this duty, it must be shown
that 1) the person had knowledge of the facts indicating a duty to act;
and 2) the person was physically capable of performing the act. *See*
LaFave & Scott, § 3.3(b), at 289 (stating prevailing view that person
may not be held criminally liable where defendant is unaware of the
facts giving rise to the duty to act); § 45-2-202, MCA (stating that a
"material element of every offense is a voluntary act, which includes an
omission to perform a duty which the law imposes on the offender and
which he is physically capable of performing").

¶34 It must be emphasized, however, that once imposed, a proven breach
of this legal duty may still fall far short of negligent homicide,
pursuant to § 45-5-104, MCA, which requires a gross deviation from an
ordinary or reasonable standard of care. *See Kirkaldie* (1978), 179
Mont. at 292, 587 P.2d at 1304. The limited circumstances under which
such a breach may give rise to criminal culpability is addressed by the
following issue.

Issue 2.

If a person who justifiably uses deadly force fails to summon aid for
her attacker, is she criminally culpable for that failure?

¶35 This issue raises the possibility that after a person is found to
have justifiably used force, and reasonably exercised her right to
secure her own safety, she may still be found criminally liable for the
ultimate death the force caused. In other words, if the duty to summon
aid may be revived, as we have just held, may the failure to perform
this legal duty give rise to criminal liability, even though the
underlying use of force was justified?

¶36 Our holding as to the first issue consequentially narrows the issue
here. Accordingly, to find a person who justifiably acts in self-defense
criminally culpable for negligently causing the death of the aggressor,
the failure to summon medical aid must be the "cause in fact" of the
original aggressor's death, not the justified use of force. *See State
v. Bier* (1979), 181 Mont. 27, 32, 591 P.2d 1115, 1118. *See also King,*
148 S.W.2d at 1047 (requiring a subsequent act that converts non-fatal
injury into a fatal one for the purpose of imposing criminal liability
following act of self-defense).

¶3 7 In a recent wrongful death case, we stated the general rule
governing whether conduct is a cause-in-fact of an event:

> \[A\] party's conduct is a cause-in-fact of an event if "the event
> would not have occurred but for that conduct; conversely, the
> defendant's conduct is not a cause of the event, if the event would
> have occurred without it."

*Gentry v. Douglas Hereford Ranch, Inc.,* 1998 MT 182, ¶ 25, 290 Mont.
126, ¶ 25, 962 P.2d 1205, ¶ 25 (quoting Prosser & Keaton on Torts § 41,
at 266 (5th ed. 1984)). *See also* § 45-2-201(1)(a), MCA (stating that
"\[cjonduct is the cause of a result if\... without the conduct the
result would not have occurred"); LaFave & Scott, § 7.12(c), at 284
(suggesting that the tort concepts of proximate cause are inapplicable
to criminal cases, and that a more direct cause is required for criminal
liability); *State v. Magruder* (1988), 234 Mont. 492, 497, 765 P.2d
716, 719 (stating that this "Court is not able to envision a case under
our present criminal code in which a proximate cause instruction would
be appropriate").

¶38 We therefore hold that a person, who is found to have used
justifiable force, but who nevertheless fails to summon aid in
dereliction of the legal duty as defined here, may be found criminally
negligent only where the failure to summon aid is the cause-in-fact of
death, rather than the use of force itself.

¶39 Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that even where such a
duty "revives" under the foregoing analysis, the breach of this duly
should not be construed as constituting criminal negligence *per se.* To
the contrary, it is entirely conceivable that in circumstances where
such a legal duty may rightfully be imposed, a failure to summon medical
assistance --- due to fear, shock, or some other manifestation resulting
from the confrontation --- would not be a gross deviation from an
ordinary standard of care as required by Montana's negligent homicide
statute. Thus, a breach of the legal duty to summon aid may be the
cause-in-fact of death, but is still not necessarily a crime under §
45-5-104, MCA. Moreover, as in ordinary negligence cases, the existence
of a legal duty to act --- whether at the time of injury or later by
"revival" --- is a question of law, while the breach of the duty is for
determination by the fact finder. *See Estate of Strever v. Cline*
(1996), 278 Mont. 165, 175, 924 P.2d 666, 672.

¶40 Determining if and to what extent this holding applies here,
however, is further complicated by the procedural facts. Namely, the
State brought a single charge of negligent homicide for the stabbing
*and* the failure to summon medical aid. Thus, if the use of force is
found to be justified, we conclude that Kuntz, as a matter of law, must
be acquitted of this single charge regardless of her conduct subsequent
to the stabbing. *See Park v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court,* 1998 MT 164,
¶ 42, 289 Mont. 367, ¶ 42, 961 P.2d 1267, ¶ 42 (Leaphart, J. concurring)
(stating that justifiable use of force, if proven, is a complete defense
resulting in an acquittal). *See also In Interest of Smith* (Pa. 1990),
579 A.2d 889, 897 (reversing conviction for lesser-included offense of
involuntary manslaughter where self-defense was found justified, and
therefore afforded defendant a "complete defense to any criminal
homicide"). This complication necessarily leads us to the next issue.

Issue 3.

Should the prosecution he permitted to argue that the defendant's
actions following the use of deadly force may be considered by the
fact-finder in making its decision as to the validity of the justifiable
use of force defense?

¶41 In denying Kuntz's motion, the District Court did not make a
preliminary evidentiary ruling on this specific issue. The court did,
however, state that at trial "both sides can make their argument whether
Defendant's actions after the stabbing tend to refute her claim of
justification." This determination, in turn, led to extensive briefing
by the parties pursuant to the application for the writ of supervisory
control. Subject to our *de novo* review, we are consequently inclined
to review whether this determination was correct in light of the
holdings reached thus far.

¶42 Pursuant to § 45-3-102, MCA, a person is "justified in the use of
force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that
he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself
or another against such other's imminent use of unlawful force." Here,
Kuntz will have the burden at trial of producing sufficient evidence on
this issue to raise a reasonable doubt of her guilt. *See State v.
Daniels* (1984), 210 Mont. 1, 16, 682 P.2d 173, 181.[^13] Ultimately,
whether or not her use of force was justified will be determined by the
jury. *See State v. Barrack* (1994), 267 Mont. 154, 162-63, 882 P.2d
1028, 1033. Such a determination will be made based on evidence of what
Kuntz reasonably believed at the time she was confronted with the
alleged imminent use of unlawful force.

¶43 Consequently, the question of whether or not the stabbing resulted
from an act of justified self-defense "must be determined by a
consideration of the circumstances as they existed at the time the blow
was *struck."People v. Fowler* (Cal. 1918), 174 P. 892, 896 (finding
evidence insufficient to support claim of justified self-defense).
Accordingly, we conclude that whether Kuntz had a duty to subsequently
summon medical aid and whether she failed in performing this duty are
wholly immaterial in determining whether the use of force was justified.
Such evidence would in no sense tend to make Kuntz's reasonable belief
at the time of the attack more or less probable, pursuant to Rule 401,
M.R.Evid. Therefore, the District Court shall be guided by this
conclusion in its evidentiary rulings regarding post-stabbing evidence
offered by the State for the purpose of rebutting Kuntz's claim of
justified use of force.

Issue 4.

Should the prosecution be permitted to argue that even if the defendant
acted with justifiable use of force, her delay in seeking medical aid
for the mortally wounded attacker was a factor in causing his death?

¶44 Pursuant to the charge of negligent homicide as it currently stands,
if the use of force was indeed justified, then a subsequent delay in
seeking medical aid would be immaterial in addressing the factors that
caused death. Again, the District Court in its evidentiary rulings
should be guided by our conclusion that, as presently charged, a finding
that Kuntz's use of force was justified would be a complete defense
requiring acquittal, and that she had no duty to immediately render or
summon aid for Becker.

¶45 More generally, this conclusion necessarily means that evidence of a
person's exercise of the right to seek and secure safety cannot, in
turn, be used as evidence demonstrating a faitee or delay in summoning
aid. A flight to safety does not necessarily require a flight to the
nearest phone by the fastest means available. Again, the revival of a
duty to render aid does not commence following a justified use of force
until a person has fully exercised her right to seek and secure safety.
Consequently, any evidentiary ruling by the District Court should be
guided by this principle regardless of how the charge or charges are
made.

Issue 5.

May the defendant's actions following an unjustified use of deadly force
be alleged as facts supporting charging the offense of negligent
homicide?

¶46 This issue specifically addresses the State's case in chief, namely
that the evidence will show that Kuntz's use of force was not justified,
and she negligently caused Becker's death by first stabbing him and then
failing to summon medical aid. To this extent, we hold that the State
may, of course, allege relevant facts that may tend to prove the
elements of the charged crime, negligent homicide. The evidentiary
purpose of such alleged facts, however, is strictly limited by our
holdings under the above issues.

¶47 For these reasons, the District Court's order denying Kuntz's motion
to amend or strike the amended information is affirmed, and this case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.

¶50 The majority has concluded that although circumstances occur which
are so extreme that a woman is justified in the use of deadly force to
defend herself, a jury can, after the fact, in the safe confines of the
jury room, conclude that at some subsequent point she was sufficiently
free from danger that she should have made an effort to save her
assailant and that because she didn't she is still criminally liable for
his death even though at some previous point in time she was justified
in taking his life. This result is simply unworkable as a practical
matter and makes poor public policy.

¶51 Section 45-3-102, MCA, provides that a person is justified in the
use of deadly force only when necessary to prevent imminent death or
serious bodily harm to herself or another, or to prevent commission of a
forceable felony. It severely limits the circumstances under which
deadly force is justified. However, it specifically recognizes that
under those circumstances, the amount of force necessary may be deadly.
It is inherently contradictory to provide by statute that under certain
circumstances deadly force may be justified, but that having so acted, a
victim has a common law duty to prevent the death of her assailant. **\[

Robertson v. Commonwealth, 82 S.W.3d 832 (Ky. 2002)

 

Opinion of the Court by Justice Cooper.

Michael Partin, a police officer employed by the city of Covington,
Kentucky, was killed when he fell through an opening between the roadway
and the walkway of the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge and into the Ohio River
while in foot pursuit of Appellant Shawnta Robertson. Following a trial
by jury in the Kenton Circuit Court, Appellant was convicted of
manslaughter in the second degree for \[recklessly\] causing Partin\'s
death, KRS 507.040(1), and was sentenced to imprisonment for six years.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, and we granted discretionary review to
further consider the circumstances under which criminal liability can be
imposed upon a defendant for injuries or death directly caused by the
volitional act of another.

At about 2:00 a.m. on January 4, 1998, Officer Brian Kane of the Kenton
County Police Department attempted to arrest Appellant in Covington for
possession of marijuana. Appellant broke free of Kane\'s grasp and began
running north on Fourth Street toward the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge which
spans the Ohio River between Covington and Cincinnati, Ohio. Kane
radioed for assistance and pursued Appellant on foot "at a sprint." When
Appellant reached the bridge, he vaulted over the concrete barrier
between the roadway and the walkway and began running north on the
walkway toward Cincinnati. Kane, who, at that point, was running on top
of the concrete barrier jumped down to the walkway and continued his
pursuit.

Meanwhile, Partin and two other Covington police officers, Steve Sweeney
and Cody Stanley, responded to Kane\'s request for assistance and
arrived at the bridge almost simultaneously in three separate
vehicles....

Partin\'s vehicle was the first of the three police cruisers to reach
the bridge. He stopped in the right northbound lane just beyond where
Appellant was running on the walkway. Stanley stopped his vehicle
directly behind Partin\'s vehicle, and Sweeney stopped in the left
northbound lane, also behind Partin\'s vehicle. Sweeney and Stanley
testified that they ... saw Partin exit his vehicle, proceed to the
concrete barrier, place his left hand on the barrier, then vault over
the barrier "as if he had done it a million times before," and
disappear. The concrete barrier was thirty-two inches high. The railing
of the walkway was forty-three inches high. There was a
forty-one-inch-wide open space between the concrete barrier and the
walkway railing. Partin fell through the open space into the river
ninety-four feet below. His body was recovered four months later.

No one will ever know why Partin fell through the opening between the
concrete barrier and the pedestrian walkway. Perhaps, he did not realize
the opening was there. Perhaps, he knew it was there and miscalculated
his vault. Either way, however, his death resulted from his own
volitional act and not from any force employed against him by Appellant.
Whether Appellant\'s act of resisting arrest by unlawful flight from
apprehension was a legal cause of Partin\'s death requires application
of the provisions of KRS 501.020(3) (definition of
"\[recklessly\][\*](#X1adaacbbf7919db920f888b6b349ca4fa53a18a)"), KRS
501.020(4) (definition of "\[negligently\]"), and KRS 501.060 ("causal
relationships").

KRS 501.020(3) defines "\[recklessly\]" as follows:

A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance
described by a statute defining an offense *when he is aware of and
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk* that the
result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of
such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross
deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would
observe in the situation\.... (Emphasis added.)

KRS 501.020(4) defines "\[negligently\]" as follows:

A person acts negligently with respect to a result or to a circumstance
described by a statute defining an offense *when he fails to perceive a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur* or that
the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that
the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the
standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the
situation. (Emphasis added.)

Thus, recklessness is the awareness of and conscious disregard of a risk
that a reasonable person in the same situation would not have
disregarded, and negligence is the failure to perceive a risk that a
reasonable person in the same situation would have perceived.

KRS 501.060 provides in pertinent part:

\(1\) Conduct is the cause of a result when it is an antecedent without
which the result in question would not have occurred. \...

\(3\) When recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an
element of the offense, the element is *not established if the actual
result is not within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the
case of negligence, of which he should be aware unless*:

\(a\) The actual result differs from the probable result only in the
respect that *a different person* or different property *is injured or
affected* or that the probable injury or harm would have been more
serious or more extensive than that caused; or

\(b\) The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the
probable result and *occurs in a manner which the actor knows or should
know is rendered substantially more probable by his conduct*.

\(4\) The question of whether an actor knew or should have known the
result he caused was rendered substantially more probable by his conduct
is an issue of fact. (Emphasis added.)

Obviously, Appellant\'s unlawful act of resisting arrest by fleeing from
apprehension was a "but for" cause of Partin\'s fatal attempt to pursue
him by vaulting from the roadway of the bridge to the walkway. As noted
by the 1974 Commentary to KRS 501.060, the issue then becomes primarily
one of mens rea.

Once an act is found to be a cause in fact of a result and a substantial
factor in bringing about that result, it is recognized as the proximate
cause unless another cause, independent of the first, intervenes between
the first and the result. And even then the first cause is treated as
the proximate cause if the harm or injury resulting from the second is
deemed to have been reasonably foreseeable by the first actor.

Thus, the fact that Partin vaulted over the concrete barrier of his own
volition does not exonerate Appellant if Partin\'s act was either
foreseen or foreseeable by Appellant as a reasonably probable result of
his own unlawful act of resisting arrest by fleeing from apprehension.

In Phillips v. Commonwealth, Ky., 17 S.W.3d 870 (2000), we relied, inter
alia, on KRS 501.060 in upholding the reckless murder conviction of a
defendant who fired shots at an intended victim from inside a vehicle
and thereby induced the intended victim to return fire and kill a
passenger in the defendant\'s vehicle. We held that it was reasonably
foreseeable that, if shots were fired at another person from inside a
vehicle, the other person would return fire in the direction of the
vehicle, thus endangering the lives of its other occupants. 17 S.W.3d at
875. Also illustrative is the pre-code case of Sanders v. Commonwealth,
244 Ky. 77, 50 S.W.2d 37 (1932), which upheld the manslaughter
conviction of a defendant who had threatened his wife with a deadly
weapon while they were in a moving vehicle, causing her to jump from the
vehicle to her death---clearly a volitional act by the victim but a
probable and reasonably foreseeable consequence of the unlawful act of
the defendant.

In both *Phillips* and *Sanders*, a defendant applied unlawful force
against another whose volitional response to that force caused the
victim\'s death. The case sub judice is conceptually more similar to
Lofthouse v. Commonwealth, Ky., 13 S.W.3d 236 (2000), which reversed the
negligent homicide conviction of a defendant who applied no force
against the victim but supplied cocaine and heroin to the victim whose
self-ingestion of those drugs caused his death. The result reached by
the plurality opinion in Lofthouse did not turn on the fact that the
victim died as a result of his own volitional act. Rather, in reversing
the conviction, the opinion emphasized the absence of any evidence that
the defendant knew or should have known that ingestion of those drugs
under those circumstances would probably cause the victim\'s death. Id.
at 241. Here, as in Lofthouse, Appellant\'s mens rea, i.e., what he knew
or should have known with respect to the probable consequences of his
conduct, is crucial to determining the issue of his criminal liability.

Analogous to this set of facts is the case where a person pursued by the
police in a high speed motor vehicle chase is held criminally liable for
the death of an innocent bystander accidentally struck by a pursuing
police vehicle. E.g., People v. Schmies, 44 Cal. App. 4th 38, 51 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 185 (Calif. App. 1996) .... In People v. Schmies, supra, the
California Court of Appeal directly addressed the effect of the police
officers\' conduct vis-a-vis the criminal liability of the defendant.

\[T\]he negligence or other fault of the officers is not a defense to
the charge against defendant. The fact that the officers may have shared
responsibility or fault for the accident does nothing to exonerate
defendant for his role. In short, whether the officers\' conduct could
be described with such labels as negligent, careless, tortious, cause
for discipline, or even criminal, in an action against them, is not at
issue with respect to the defendant here. In this sense the
"reasonableness" of the officers\' conduct, focused upon their point of
view and their blameworthiness for the death, is not relevant.

*The issue with respect to defendant focuses upon his point of view,
that is, whether the harm that occurred was a reasonably foreseeable
consequence of his conduct at the time he acted*. Since the officers\'
conduct was a direct and specific response to defendant\'s conduct, the
claim that their conduct was a superseding cause of the accident can be
supported only through a showing that their conduct was so unusual,
abnormal, or extraordinary that it could not have been foreseen.

51 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 193-94 (emphasis added). Although California does
not have a statutory equivalent of KRS 501.060, this common law analysis
of causation is consistent with the principles embodied in our
statute.... The fault or negligence of the officer is not determinative
of the defendant\'s guilt. However, the reasonableness of the officer\'s
response is relevant in determining whether the response was foreseeable
by the defendant. The more reasonable the response, the more likely that
the defendant should have foreseen it. It is immaterial that the
ultimate victim was the officer, himself, as opposed to an innocent
bystander.

Here, the conduct that supports Appellant\'s conviction is not, as the
Commonwealth suggests, his own act of vaulting over the concrete
barrier. Partin was not present when that act occurred; thus, it was not
reasonably foreseeable that he would have vaulted over the barrier in
reliance on the fact that Appellant had done so without incident. (That
analysis might have been appropriate if Officer Kane had fallen from the
bridge when he followed Appellant onto the walkway.) The conduct that
supports Appellant\'s conviction is the continuation of his unlawful
flight when he obviously knew that Partin intended to pursue him (as
evidenced by the fact that when he saw Partin\'s vehicle stop, he
reversed course and began running in the opposite direction), and that,
to do so, Partin would be required to cross the open space between the
roadway and the walkway and thereby risk falling to his death. "The
question of whether \[Appellant\] knew or should have known \[that
Partin\'s death\] was rendered substantially more probable by his
conduct is an issue of fact." KRS 501.060(4). There was sufficient
evidence in this case to present that fact to a jury....

Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the
Kenton Circuit Court are affirmed.

Concurring Opinion by Justice Graves.

... The act of vaulting the gap between the roadway and the sidewalk is
sufficiently reckless to support the jury\'s verdict in this case.
Appellant was aware of the danger of the gap and consciously disregarded
it when he jumped. Knowing he was being pursued by at least one officer
on foot, Appellant had to assume any pursuing officer would attempt to
follow him, also becoming susceptible to the risk. A gap of nearly 4
feet across a drop of 94 feet into moving water cannot be described as
anything but a substantial unjustifiable risk. It is certainly logical
for the jury to conclude that, when Appellant disregarded this risk to
which he was subjecting those lawfully pursuing him, he grossly deviated
from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe.

avoid confusion and to make this opinion consistent with the definitions
of mens rea terms that are used in most states (and in the Model Penal
Code), I have changed throughout this opinion the actual mens rea terms

term "wantonly" where most states and the MPC use the term "recklessly."
More confusingly, Kenucky employs the term "recklessness" to mean what
the MPC and most states define as "negligence." For ease of reading, I
did not use brackets to denote every change of these terms in the

Commonwealth v. Carter, 481 Mass. 352, 115 N.E.3d 559 (2019)

 

\[Recall the *Carter* decision that we read in Chapter 3 in which the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed Carter\'s involuntary
manslaughter conviction. That portion of the court\'s opinion focused on
Carter\'s *actus reus* of encouraging Mr. Roy\'s suicide. Below the
court affirms the trial court\'s conclusion that Carter\'s conduct was
the legal cause of Mr. Roy\'s death:\]

\... The \[trial\] judge then further found that \[Carter\'s\] conduct
caused the victim's death beyond a reasonable doubt. His finding of
causation in this context, at that precise moment in time, includes the
concept of coercion, in the sense of overpowering the victim's will.

This finding is supported by the temporal distinctions about causation
drawn by the judge. Until the victim got out of the truck, the judge
described the victim as the cause of his own suicidal actions and
reactions. This period of "self-causation" and "self-help," which is
completely consistent with his prior behavior, ended when he got out of
the truck. As the judge explained:

"It is apparent to this Court in reviewing the evidence that \[the
victim\] was struggling with his issues and seeing a way to address them
and took significant actions of his own toward that end. His research
was extensive. He spoke of it continually. He secured the generator. He
secured the water pump. He researched how to fix the generator. He
located his vehicle in an unnoticeable area and commenced his attempt by
starting the pump.

"*However, he breaks that chain of self-causation by exiting the
vehicle*. He takes himself out of the toxic environment that it has
become. This is completely consistent with his earlier attempts at
suicide. In October of 2012, when he attempted to drown himself, he
literally sought air. When he exited the truck, he literally sought
fresh air. And he told a parent of that attempt.

"Several weeks later, in October of 2012 again, he attempts, through the
use of pills, to take his life but calls a friend and assistance is
sought and treatment secured. That \[the victim\] may have tried and
maybe succeeded another time, after July 12 or 13 of 2014, is of no
consequence to this Court's deliberations." (Emphasis added.)

The judge found that, once the victim left the truck, the defendant
overpowered the victim's will and thus caused his death. As the
defendant herself explained, and we repeat due to its importance, "\[The
victim's\] death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him I
was on the phone with him and he got out of the \[truck\] because it was
working and he got scared and I fucking told him to get back in \...
because I knew he would do it all over again the next day and I couldnt
have him live the way he was living anymore I couldnt do it I wouldnt
let him."

Although we recognize that legal causation in the context of suicide is
an incredibly complex inquiry, we conclude that there was sufficient
evidence to support a finding of proof of such causation beyond a
reasonable doubt in the instant case. The judge could have properly
found, based on this evidence, that the vulnerable, confused, mentally
ill, eighteen year old victim had managed to save himself once again in
the midst of his latest suicide attempt, removing himself from the truck
as it filled with carbon monoxide. But then in this weakened state he
was badgered back into the gas-infused truck by the defendant, his
girlfriend and closest, if not only, confidant in this suicidal
planning, the person who had been constantly pressuring him to complete
their often discussed plan, fulfill his promise to her, and finally
commit suicide. And then after she convinced him to get back into the
carbon monoxide filled truck, she did absolutely nothing to help him:
she did not call for help or tell him to get out of the truck as she
listened to him choke and die.

In sum, the evidence at trial, in the light most favorable to the
Commonwealth, was sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.

1.  Due process claims

The defendant argues that she lacked fair notice that she could be
convicted of involuntary manslaughter for her role in the victim's
suicide[10](#Xbec235533e5cf9cd18825971b5de15140c3b7fc) and that her
conviction therefore violated her right to due process. That is, she
argues that the law of involuntary manslaughter is unconstitutionally
vague as applied to her conduct. We ... remain of the view that the law
is not vague\....

"Manslaughter is a common-law crime that has not been codified by
statute in Massachusetts." *Carter I*, supra. It has long been
established in our common law that wanton or reckless conduct that
causes a person's death constitutes involuntary manslaughter. See, e.g.,
Commonwealth v. Campbell, 352 Mass. 387, 397, 226 N.E.2d 211 (1967), and
cases cited ("Involuntary manslaughter is an unlawful homicide,
unintentionally caused \... by an act which constitutes such a disregard
of probable harmful consequences to another as to constitute wanton or
reckless conduct"). There is no doubt in this case that the defendant
wantonly or recklessly instructed the victim to kill himself, and that
her instructions caused his death.

Moreover, in the development of our common law, "conduct similar to that
of the defendant has been deemed unlawful." In Persampieri v.
Commonwealth, 343 Mass. 19, 22-23 (1961), the defendant was charged with
murder, and pleaded guilty to manslaughter, after his wife threatened to
commit suicide and he taunted her, saying she was "chicken---and
wouldn't do it," loaded a rifle and handed it to her, and, when she had
difficulty firing the rifle, told her to take off her shoes and reach
the trigger that way. She did so and killed herself. Id. at 23. We held
that these facts would "have warranted a jury in returning a verdict of
manslaughter." Id....

1.  "Infliction" of serious bodily harm

The defendant argues that her conviction as a youthful offender cannot
survive under G. L. c. 119, § 54, because she did not inflict serious
bodily harm on the victim. She argues that the term "infliction" in § 54
requires direct, physical causation of harm, not mere proximate
causation, and that from her remote location, she could not have
inflicted serious bodily harm on the victim within the meaning of the
statute. We reject this unduly narrow interpretation of the statutory
language. The youthful offender statute authorizes an indictment against
a juvenile who is "alleged to have committed an offense \...
involv\[ing\] the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm" (emphasis
added). G. L. c. 119, § 54. By its terms, the statute requires that the
offense involve the infliction of serious bodily harm, not that the
defendant herself be the one who directly inflicted it. If we were to
interpret the statute to include such a requirement, it is difficult to
see how a juvenile could be indicted as a youthful offender for, say,
hiring a third party to carry out an attack on a victim. It is enough,
as we said in *Carter I*, that "involuntary manslaughter in these
circumstances inherently involves the infliction of serious bodily
harm." *Carter I*, 474 Mass. at 637 n.19\....

*Conclusion*: The evidence against the defendant proved that, by her
wanton or reckless conduct, she caused the victim's death by suicide.
Her conviction of involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender is not
legally or constitutionally infirm. The judgment is therefore affirmed.

 

[10](#X3c57f7a3090b2f3ac8529440c59c43884023d20) The defendant
characterizes her conduct as merely \"encouraging\" the victim\'s
suicide. As we have discussed at length, however, it is clear from the
judge\'s findings that she did not merely encourage the victim, but
coerced him to get back into the truck, causing his death.

**\[ ... \]**

Marshall, C.J.

The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree on a theory of
deliberate premeditation, and of unlawful possession of a firearm. G. L.
c. 269, § 10(a). The trial judge denied the defendant's motion to set
aside the verdict and to enter a finding of not guilty or to order a new
trial, or, in the alternative, to reduce the verdict to manslaughter.
See Mass. R. Crim. P. 25, 378 Mass. 896 (1979). The defendant's motion
to reconsider that ruling was also denied. The defendant appeals from
his conviction of murder.[^14] He challenges the sufficiency of the
evidence of deliberate premeditation, and also challenges on
constitutional grounds the presence of the prosecutor during the grand
jury deliberations and voting. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 5(g), 378 Mass. 850
(1979) ("The prosecuting attorney shall not be present during
deliberation and voting except at the request of the grand jury"). The
defendant asks that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, § 33E, to
reduce his conviction to a lesser degree of guilt, or to grant him a new
trial. We affirm the defendant's conviction of murder in the first
degree, and see no basis to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, § 33E.

1\. *Facts.* The jury could have found that at approximately 2 a.m. on
May 25, 1997, the defendant was involved in an altercation involving
several persons outside a nightclub in Worcester. The fight began when
two men attacked the defendant. At some point during or after the fight
in which several persons had thrown punches, the defendant left the
brawl and went to a nearby automobile where he retrieved a gun from the
trunk. He then turned in the direction from which he had come and shot
the victim at close range. There was evidence that the victim had
followed the defendant to the automobile, but no evidence that the
victim was armed at the time of the shooting. There was evidence that
the defendant also shot the victim a second time as he lay on the
ground. After the shooting, the defendant and three other men jumped
into an automobile and sped away.

Paramedics arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting and found the
victim with a gunshot wound to his chest. The victim was transported to
a hospital, where he died approximately two hours later. A medical
examiner located a single bullet that killed the victim lodged in his
lower right chest. The gun used in the shooting was not recovered.

2\. *Sufficiency of the evidence.* The defendant asserts that the
evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to find that the element of
deliberate premeditation had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt
because there was insufficient time for the defendant to have planned
the killing. For the same reason (insufficiency of the evidence to
establish the element of deliberate premeditation) the defendant argues
that his murder conviction was obtained in violation of his Federal due
process rights. *Jackson* v. *Virginia,* 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979).
There was no error.

We consider the evidence presented in its light most favorable to the
Commonwealth, to determine whether it is sufficient "to permit the jury
to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged."
*Commonwealth* v. *Latimore,* 378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting
*Commonwealth* v. *Sandler,* 368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975). To convict the
defendant of murder in the first degree, the Commonwealth was required
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully killed
the victim, with deliberate premeditation and malice aforethought.
*Commonwealth* v. *Judge,* 420 Mass. 433, 437 (1995). Because the
defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to one element
only --- deliberate premeditation --- we examine the sufficiency of
evidence relevant to that element alone. *Commonwealth* v. *Latimore,
supra* at 677-678. The Commonwealth was required to establish beyond a
reasonable doubt that the defendant "reflected on his resolution to
kill," *Commonwealth* v. *Ruci,* 409 Mass. 94, 96 (1991), and cases
cited, and that the defendant's decision to kill was the product of
"cool reflection," *Commonwealth* v. *Davis,* 403 Mass. 575, 582
(1988).[^15] " 'Cool reflection' merely requires that 'the purpose
\[be\] resolved upon and the mind determined to do it before the blow is
struck\[;\] then it is, within the meaning of the law, deliberately
premeditated malice aforethought." *Id.,* quoting *Commonwealth* v.
*Tucker,* 189 Mass. 457, 494 (1905).

The defendant recognizes that no particular period of reflection is
required, and that a plan to murder may be formed in seconds.
*Commonwealth* v. *Robertson,* 408 Mass. 747, 757 (1990). See
*Commonwealth* v. *Tucker, supra* at 495 (deliberate premeditation may
be "a matter of days, hours, or even seconds"). He argues that, because
the fighting started when two men attacked the defendant and thereafter
"everything was spontaneous," there was not enough time for the
defendant to plan the killing. We disagree. Three witnesses testified
that, during or after a brief fistfight, the defendant walked to the
trunk of a nearby automobile and obtained a gun. One witness testified
that, as the defendant walked toward an automobile, he overheard another
man say, "It ain't over. It ain't over. Pop the trunk. Pop the trunk."
This witness saw the trunk pop open, and the man hand something to the
defendant, who then turned toward and shot the victim. A rational jury
could infer that as the defendant walked toward the automobile, he
formed the plan to kill. See *Commonwealth* v. *Whipple,* 377 Mass. 709,
714-715 (1979) (sufficient evidence of premeditation where defendant
disengaged from fistfight, obtained gun from nearby automobile, returned
and shot victim).

One witness also testified that, after the defendant shot at the victim
once, the victim fell to the ground, and the defendant "stepped back
like a foot or so, and . . . shot at him again." Other witnesses also
heard more than one shot. Because only one bullet wound was located in
the victim's body and the victim fell to the ground after the first
shot, the defendant argues that this evidence cannot support a finding
of deliberate premeditation, as the fatal shot had already been fired.
But the jury could have inferred in these circumstances that the
multiple shots fired at the victim were evidence of deliberate
premeditation, even if only one shot killed the victim. *Commonwealth*
v. *Good,* 409 Mass. 612, 618 (1991) (evidence that defendant approached
victim and at close range fired three bullets at victim sufficient to
support finding that "before the shooting, the defendant at least
briefly reflected on his resolution to kill"). See *Commonwealth* v.
*Watkins,* 373 Mass. 849, 852 (1977). The placement of the fatal wound,
fired at close range into the victim's chest would also support a
finding of deliberate premeditation. *Commonwealth* v. *Robertson,
supra* (placement of bullet wound supports jury's finding of deliberate
premeditation).

The defendant points to testimony that he claims undermines the evidence
of deliberate premeditation, namely that the victim chased the defendant
as he approached the automobile from which he obtained the gun. But
there was no evidence that the victim was armed, or that the defendant
shot the victim to protect himself from the victim. In any event, the
defendant's reliance on contradictory evidence is misplaced. "Once
sufficient evidence is presented to warrant submission of the charges to
the jury, it is for the jury alone to determine what weight will be
accorded to the evidence." *Commonwealth* v. *Ruci, supra* at 97,
quoting *Commonwealth* v. *Hill,* 387 Mass. 619, 624 (1982).

Because we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support a
finding of deliberate premeditation, there is no merit to the
defendant's due process claim premised on the same theory.

3\. *Postconviction motion to set aside or to reduce the verdict.* The
defendant argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to
deny his postconviction motion to set aside or to reduce the verdict
pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2).[^16] The judge adhered to the
standards to be applied in ruling on such a motion and, for the reasons
he articulated, did not abuse his discretion.

First, as to the defendant's postverdict motion for a required finding
of not guilty, the judge must assess the legal sufficiency of the
evidence by the standard set out in *Commonwealth* v. *Latimore,* 378
Mass. 671, 677 (1979). See *Commonwealth* v. *Doucette,* 408 Mass. 454,
456 (1990). For the reasons discussed in Part 2, *supra,* the
defendant's postconviction motion to set aside the verdict was properly
denied.

The defendant also argues that the judge abused his discretion by not
reducing the verdict because the "verdict was against the weight of the
evidence and a manslaughter verdict would be more consonant with
justice." Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2). The defendant points to the
evidence that he did not start the fight, but became involved after
being attacked by two unknown men. He notes that there was evidence that
the victim was walking or running behind him when the defendant
retrieved the gun.[^17] He suggests that, because the shooting occurred
during a "free-for-all" during which he and the victim exchanged blows,
the crime should more properly be seen as manslaughter as the result of
provocation or sudden combat.

The defendant correctly states that the judge should have been guided by
the same considerations that guide us in exercising our power under G.
L. c. 278, § 33E, but insists that the judge did not consider any of the
factors on which we have relied in granting relief under that statute.
See *Commonwealth* v. *Carter,* 423 Mass. 506, 513 (1996) (this court's
authority to reduce verdict under § 33E identical to power of trial
judge under rule 25 \[b\] \[2\]); *Commonwealth* v. *Gaulden,* 383 Mass.
543, 553 & n.7 (1981).

Rule 25 (b) (2) empowers a judge to reduce a jury's verdict when, in the
judge's discretion, the lesser verdict is required in the interests of
justice. *Commonwealth* v. *Doucette, supra.* We have noted, however,
that a judge should exercise this broad power sparingly. See
*Commonwealth* v. *Woodward,* 427 Mass. 659, 667 (1998); *Commonwealth*
v. *Keough,* 385 Mass. 314, 319-321 (1982). The judge concluded that
"considering the weight and credibility of the Commonwealth's case, the
verdict was consonant with justice" and "in the interest of justice." On
our own review of the evidence, without benefit of the judge's superior
information regarding the credibility of the witnesses, we cannot
conclude that he abused his discretion. The evidence recited above
supports the judge's conclusion that there is no evidence suggesting
that the defendant killed the victim because he was provoked or engaged
in sudden combat.

The verdict in this case is consistent with similar cases that have
resulted in verdicts of murder in the first degree. See, e.g.,
*Commonwealth* v. *Whipple,* 377 Mass. 709, 711-715 (1979) (verdict not
reduced where defendant left brief fistfight to obtain gun and returned
to shoot victim); *Commonwealth* v. *Watkins,* 373 Mass. 849, 852-853
(1977) (verdict not reduced where evidence showed that during argument
defendant ran to another room, retrieved knife, returned, and stabbed
victim). The judge applied the proper legal standards, and did not abuse
his discretion in denying the defendant's motion.

4\. *Grand jury proceedings.* The prosecutor was present during grand
jury deliberations and voting. The defendant asserts that his presence
at those times "is presumed prejudice and fundamental error," and
violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution, and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration
of Rights.[^18] Rule 5 (g) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal
Procedure permits the presence of the prosecutor in the grand jury, on
an affirmative vote of the grand jury. In this case, the grand jury
voted unanimously to request the prosecutor's presence during their
deliberations and vote. The defendant recognizes that our rule allows
this practice, and that the grand jury's vote in this case was proper.
He also recognizes that in *Commonwealth* v. *Smith,* 414 Mass. 437
(1993), we rejected this same constitutional challenge to our rule. He
properly, and with welcome frankness, notes that there is no evidence
that, in this case, the prosecutor improperly interfered with the grand
jury. He simply asks us to reconsider our holding in *Commonwealth* v.
*Smith, supra.* We have done so, and conclude once again that our
procedural rule does not suffer from any constitutional infirmity.

The defendant points to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 (d), which provides that "no
person other than the jurors may be present while the grand jury is
deliberating or voting." As we noted in *Commonwealth* v. *Smith, supra*
at 439, citing *United States* v. *Williams,* 504 U.S. 36 (1992), and
*United States* v. *Hastings,* 461 U.S. 499, 505 (1983), the United
States Supreme Court has characterized Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 (d) as a
"procedural rule\[ \] not specifically required by the Constitution or
the Congress." "While rule 6 (d) was surely designed to promote 'the
integrity of the grand jury's functions' \... it does not follow that a
different rule, such as Mass. R. Crim. P. 5 (g), which is also designed
to promote the integrity of the grand jury process, is fundamentally
unfair and violative of due process" (citation omitted). *Commonwealth*
v. *Smith, supra,* quoting *United States* v. *Williams, supra* at 46.
But see *United States* v. *Mechanik,* 475 U.S. 66, 74-75 (1986)
(O'Connor, J., concurring) ("if the prosecuting attorney were to remain
in the jury room during the jury's deliberations in contravention of the
Rule, a very real possibility would arise that the jury's deliberations
or vote would be unduly influenced by the prosecutor's presence").

We recognize that prosecutorial misconduct during grand jury proceedings
would have serious consequences, and that the prosecutor has a duty to
refrain from conduct that would produce a wrongful indictment. As we
noted in *Commonwealth* v. *Smith, supra,* the prosecutor has no right
to stay with the grand jury, and must withdraw on their request. *Id.*
at 441. He must remain silent unless his advice or opinion is sought,
and cannot participate in deliberations or express opinion on questions
of fact. *Id.* His duty is to present the evidence, and explain the
meaning of the law. *Id.* He may not attempt in any way to influence the
outcome of the deliberations. *Id.* As a constitutional matter, we
cannot conclude that the mere presence of the prosecutor during grand
jury deliberations invalidates the proceedings.

Our rules of procedure are not cast in stone, and through our approved
process, rules can be and are amended from time to time. Rule 5 (g) of
the Massachusetts rules seeks an appropriate balance between the
independence of the grand jury and the need of lay grand jurors to have
the assistance of the prosecutor's legal expertise. Rule 6 (d) of the
Federal rules embodies a different but similar accommodation of those
twin objectives. Our decision today does not foreclose a change to our
rule in the future.

5\. *Review under G. L. c. 278, § 33E.* We have reviewed the entire
record. We decline to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, § 33E,
to direct the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt, or to
order a new trial.

*Judgment affirmed.*

Provocation and Emotional Disturbance

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth v. Acevedo

 

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

446 Mass. 435 (2006)

SPINA, J. The defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree for
the stabbing death of Charles McCullough during a fight. At trial,
defense counsel argued for acquittal based on self-defense, and the
trial judge instructed the jury on self-defense, voluntary manslaughter
based on excessive force in self-defense, and involuntary manslaughter.
The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the second degree. The
defendant appealed from the conviction and filed a motion for a new
trial,** **arguing that the failure of the judge to instruct the jury on
voluntary manslaughter based on reasonable provocation created a
substantial risk of a miscarriage** **of justice .... This motion was
denied by the judge after a nonevidentiary hearing. The defendant\'s
appeal from the order denying his motion for a new trial was
consolidated with his direct appeal, and in an unpublished memorandum
and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed the
order and the conviction. *Commonwealth v. Acevedo*, 63 Mass. App. Ct.
1106, 824 N.E.2d 486 (2005). We granted the defendant\'s application for
further appellate review, and [we now reverse both the order and the
conviction]{.underline}.

*Background*. On November 17, 2000, Crystal Graham, a high school
student, hosted a party at her home in Lowell after a school dance.
Charles McCullough, Graham\'s former boy friend, attended the party.
\[McCullough was drinking beer at the party and had taken the drug
commonly known as "ecstasy." Several of the Commonwealth\'s witnesses
testified that McCullough appeared to be in a good mood that night, but
the medical examiner testified that large amounts of "ecstasy" may cause
paranoia or aggressive behavior.\] When the defendant and four of his
friends arrived at the party, they argued with McCullough, who accused
them of stealing his headlights. Graham told the defendant and his
friends to leave if they were going to fight, and they left the party.

Approximately forty-five minutes later, the defendant and his friends
returned to the party. Another argument involving the defendant and
McCullough ensued. The argument escalated into a physical confrontation
when two of the defendant\'s friends punched McCullough. Graham demanded
that everyone leave, and the defendant and his friends suggested taking
the fight outside. Once outside, McCullough challenged the defendant to
fight "one on one," and they stepped toward each other, into the middle
of a circle of people. McCullough, who was unarmed, punched the
defendant in the head, and the defendant appeared to be punching
McCullough\'s chest: no one else was involved in the fight. After ten
seconds, McCullough fell back, holding his chest, and shouted that the
defendant had stabbed him.

Although none of the Commonwealth\'s witnesses had seen a knife,
McCullough had been** **stabbed five times. One wound penetrated his
heart, and another perforated his liver: both injuries caused McCullough
to lose a significant amount of blood quickly. McCullough collapsed in
the street, and the defendant and his friends fled. When police arrived
on the scene, at approximately 3 *A*.*M*., McCullough, still alive, was
able to tell an officer that the defendant had stabbed him. He was
pronounced dead when he arrived at a hospital....

Testifying on his own behalf at trial, the defendant explained that he
and his friends went to Graham\'s party, but they left because
McCullough was "trying to start" trouble. They returned to the party
later, hoping that more people had arrived. They again encountered
McCullough, who started an argument with two of the defendant\'s friends
that escalated into a physical confrontation. After McCullough
challenged them to "rumble," the defendant decided to leave the party
and ran outside, followed by his friends and other party guests. He
tried to get into a friend\'s car but, finding it locked, he joined his
friends in the crowd that had gathered on the street. The defendant and
his friends walked backward** **across the street as McCullough and his
friends approached them. The defendant saw McCullough look at him, bite
his lip, make a fist, and run toward him. Someone hit the side of the
defendant\'s face, knocking him to the ground. He felt people beating
him about the head and attempted to push them away, but could not. The
defendant then pulled his knife from his pocket, opened it, and swung it
several times. After he heard McCullough cry out that he had been
stabbed, he ran to his friend\'s car. The defendant threw the knife out
the window as they drove over a bridge.

The defendant explained that he feared for his life because he was
outnumbered and could not get away from his attackers: by his
estimation, there were at least fifteen men, including McCullough,
involved in the confrontation. On cross-examination, the defendant
admitted that he could have run after discovering the cars were locked,
but he did not want to leave his friends. He also acknowledged that
McCullough was not the first person** **to hit him, and that when he
fell backward, he could not see who was punching him.

Two of the defendant\'s friends who attended the party with him that
night also testified for the defense. They corroborated the defendant\'s
testimony that he left the party after a fight started; that a large
crowd gathered outside; and that a group of men, including McCullough,
surrounded the defendant, knocked him to the ground, and hit him. Both
witnesses testified that they saw McCullough punch the defendant twice
before the group closed in on him.

At the close of evidence, defense counsel orally requested jury
instructions on manslaughter, without specifying a theory, and
involuntary manslaughter. The Commonwealth argued that jury instructions
on any theory of manslaughter were not warranted because, even in the
light most favorable to the defendant, the evidence did not show that he
acted based on heat of passion, reasonable provocation, or sudden
combat. The Commonwealth also argued that the defendant was not entitled
to an instruction on self-defense. Over the Commonwealth\'s objection,
the judge instructed the jury on self-defense, voluntary manslaughter
based on excessive force in self-defense, and involuntary manslaughter.
The judge did not provide instructions on reasonable provocation or
sudden combat. Defense counsel did not object to the instructions.

... On the third day of deliberations, the jurors submitted \[this
question: "Could you elaborate on malice? Please define all mitigating
circumstances which should be considered in deciding malice. In other
words, other than excessive force in self-defense, are there any other
mitigating circumstances that would eliminate malice?"\] After
discussing the issue with counsel, the judge reinstructed the jury on
malice and informed them, again without objection, that there were no
mitigating circumstances to consider other than excessive force in
self-defense. The jury returned their verdict finding the defendant
guilty of murder in the second degree approximately forty minutes after
the judge answered their ... question.

The defendant timely appealed from his conviction. Later, represented by
new counsel, he filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the
omission of a jury instruction on reasonable provocation created a
substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice ... \[T\]he judge denied
the motion, concluding that the evidence at** **trial, viewed in the
light most favorable to the defendant, would not have warranted an
instruction on reasonable provocation, even if that instruction had been
requested....

The defendant\'s direct appeal was consolidated with his appeal from the
judge\'s order denying his motion for a new trial. In a memorandum and
order affirming both the conviction and the order, the Appeals Court
concluded that the absence of** **a jury instruction on reasonable
provocation was not error because counsel did not request the
instruction, and the trial judge was not obligated to provide one sua
sponte....

*Discussion*. ... As** **a threshold matter, we must determine whether
the defendant would have been entitled to a jury instruction on
reasonable provocation had he requested one. See, e.g., *Commonwealth v.
DeMarco*,** **444 Mass. 678, 685, 830 N.E.2d 1068 (2005) (counsel not
ineffective in failing to request instruction to which defendant not
entitled). If requested, "\[a\] manslaughter instruction is required if,
on \'any view of the evidence,\' regardless of** **the credibility,
manslaughter may be found." *Commonwealth v. Carrion*, 407 Mass. 263,
266-267, 552 N.E.2d 558 (1990).... We therefore view the evidence in the
light most favorable to the defendant to determine whether an
instruction on reasonable provocation was warranted....

Voluntary manslaughter is an unlawful killing "arising not from malice,
but \'from \... sudden passion induced by reasonable provocation, sudden
combat, or excessive force in self-defense.\'" *Commonwealth v.
Carrion*, *supra* at 267. Reasonable provocation is provocation that
"would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person such a state of
passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse his
capacity for reflection or restraint." *Commonwealth v. Walden*, 380
Mass. 724, 728, 405 N.E.2d 939 (1980). A jury instruction on reasonable
provocation is warranted "if there is evidence of provocation deemed
adequate in law to cause the accused to lose his self-control in the
heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before
sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\'s temper to cool."
*Commonwealth v. Andrade*, 422 Mass. 236, 237, 661 N.E.2d 1308 (1996).
The defendant\'s actions must be "both objectively and subjectively
reasonable. That is, the jury must be able to infer that a reasonable
person would have become sufficiently provoked and would not have
\'cooled off\' by the time of the homicide, and that in fact a defendant
was provoked and did not cool off." *Commonwealth v. Groome*, 435 Mass.
201, 220, 755 N.E.2d 1224 (2001).

The defendant presented adequate evidence of reasonable provocation. He
testified that, as he left the party, he was surrounded by McCullough
and his friends, who repeatedly punched him in the head. He further
testified that these men** **knocked him to the ground, and that he
feared for his life because he was outnumbered by his attackers. Such
testimony, if credited, could demonstrate "fear, fright, or nervous
excitement" on the part of the defendant, sufficient to overcome a
reasonable person\'s "capacity for reflection or restraint." \[*In a
footnote, the court added*: The Commonwealth claims that the actual
provoking fact in this case was McCullough\'s accusation that the
defendant stole his headlights, and that any provocation arising from
that accusation should have dissipated by the time the defendant
returned to the party forty-five minutes later. In other words, the
Commonwealth ... argues that a reasonable person would have "cooled off"
by the time he returned to the party, and therefore the defendant\'s
actions were not objectively reasonable.... The defendant maintains that
the provocation occurred not when words were exchanged at the party
earlier in the night, but outside in the street, when McCullough and his
friends charged at him, knocked him to the ground, and punched him in
the head. According to defense witnesses, this occurred immediately
before the stabbing, and if their testimony is credited, the
defendant\'s emotions would not have had time to cool.\]

It is well established that "provocation must come from the victim."
*Commonwealth v. Ruiz*, 442 Mass. 826, 838-839, 817 N.E.2d 771 (2004),
and cases cited. The Commonwealth contends that the defendant was not
entitled to an instruction on provocation because, even considering the
defendant\'s own testimony, there was no evidence of adequate
provocation from McCullough: the defendant could state with certainty
only that McCullough looked at him, made a fist, and ran toward him, not
that he actually struck him. We do not agree with the Commonwealth\'s
contention. Several defense witnesses, including the defendant,
testified that McCullough was part of a group of young men who
surrounded the defendant, knocked him down, and beat him. Although the
defendant testified that he could not see which of the men struck the
blows, two defense witnesses testified that they saw McCullough strike
the defendant twice. At times, even a single blow from the victim can
constitute reasonable provocation.** **See *Commonwealth v. Maskell*,
403 Mass. 111, 116-117, 526 N.E.2d 756 (1988). "Whether the contact is
sufficient will depend on whether** **a reasonable person under similar
circumstances would have been provoked to act out of emotion rather than
reasoned reflection." Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 29 (1999). A
jury could conclude that a reasonable person in the defendant\'s
position would have felt an "immediate and intense" threat, and lashed
out in fear as a result. *Commonwealth v. Amaral*, 389 Mass. 184, 189,
450 N.E.2d 142 (1983)....

A substantial risk of a miscarriage exists "if we have a serious doubt
whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error
not been made." *Commonwealth v. LeFave*, 430 Mass. 169, 174, 714 N.E.2d
805 (1999). Although we cannot be certain that the jury would have
returned a verdict of voluntary manslaughter had they been instructed on
reasonable provocation, it appears to be a real possibility in this
case. The jury need not have been convinced beyond a** **reasonable
doubt that the defendant reasonably was provoked: they only would need
to harbor a reasonable doubt on the issue. *Commonwealth v. Acevedo*,
427 Mass. 714, 716, 695 N.E.2d 1065 (1998) (when defendant raises issue
of reasonable provocation, burden on Commonwealth to prove beyond
reasonable doubt that defendant acted with malice by demonstrating that
defendant was not reasonably provoked). The Commonwealth\'s case was
strong but not overwhelming: the Commonwealth\'s witnesses testified
that the fight involved only McCullough and the defendant, and that the
defendant was the instigator, whereas defense witnesses testified that
the defendant** **was attacked by McCullough and others. \[The jury\'s
decision to convict the defendant of murder in the second degree, rather
than murder in the first degree, shows that they rejected the
Commonwealth\'s theory of deliberate premeditation.\] The jury\'s ...
question strongly suggests their willingness to consider other
mitigating factors, the evidence supported an instruction on reasonable
provocation, and the theory of provocation was consistent with the other
defense theories. Accordingly, we conclude that trial counsel\'s failure
to request an instruction on reasonable provocation manifestly was
unreasonable, deprived the defendant of an available, substantial ground
of defense, and created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed, the verdict set
aside, and the order denying the defendant\'s motion for a new trial is
reversed. We remand the case to the Superior Court for trial.

 

 

 

State v. Shumway

 

Utah Supreme Court\
63 P.3d 94, 2002 UT 124 (2002)

HOWE, Justice:

Defendant Brookes Colby Shumway appeals from a judgment of conviction
for murder, a first degree felony under section 76-5-203 of the Utah
Code, and for tampering with evidence, a second degree felony under
section 76-8-510.

On January 22, 2000, then fifteen-year-old Brookes Colby Shumway spent
much of the day with his friend, fourteen-year-old Christopher Ray. That
evening, Brookes "slept** **over" at Christopher\'s trailer home.
Brookes and Christopher were up until 5:30 a.m. playing video games. At
about 7 a.m., Brookes went to Christopher\'s mother\'s room and awoke
her by exclaiming that Christopher had tried to stab him and that he
stabbed Christopher back and thought that he might be dead.
Christopher\'s mother came out of her room and found Christopher lying
on his back on the floor in the front room with a butcher knife covered
in blood next to him. She called 911, and the police and paramedics
arrived shortly thereafter. After trying to revive Christopher, the
paramedics declared him dead at the scene. The police searched the
trailer and took into evidence the butcher knife, along with other
knives from the kitchen.

The police also found that blankets the boys had been using had blood
stains and stab patterns in them and were rolled up in the corner of the
front room. A gym bag in Christopher\'s bedroom contained bloody socks.
Later that day, after the police finished their search and
investigation, a crime scene cleanup company cleaned out the trailer.
The next day, the state medical examiner reported that Christopher had
been stabbed thirty-nine times and that** **some of the stab wounds,
including the fatal neck wound to the carotid artery, apparently had
been inflicted with an instrument other than the butcher knife found by
police. That instrument was never found.

Brookes was subsequently charged with murder and with tampering with the
evidence. The juvenile court certified him to stand trial as an adult in
the district court. Following deliberations, the jury convicted Brookes
of both charges. He now appeals.

Brookes contends that the trial court erred in giving jury instruction
26, which mandated the order of deliberation on the murder charge. That
instruction stated:

Before you can convict the defendant, Brookes Colby Shumway, of the
offense of Manslaughter, a lesser included offense in count I of the
information, you must have found that the evidence fails to establish
one or more of the elements of Murder, as charged in count I of the
information, beyond a reasonable doubt \....

Brookes\' trial counsel made no objection to the jury instruction.
Brookes now contends, and the State concedes, that the instruction was
erroneous .... In that case, we held that the trial court is not to
mandate a specific order of deliberation to the jury concerning lesser
included offenses .... Additionally, in the instant case the instruction
was particularly erroneous because the jury should have been allowed to
consider extreme emotional disturbance manslaughter even if they
determined that all the elements of murder had been proved. In \[*State
v.*\] *Piansiaksone*, we wrote:

It was theoretically possible that the jury could have found that every
necessary element for murder had been satisfied and yet that
manslaughter was the crime committed if the jury found that the killing
was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for
which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.

954 P.2d 861, 870 (Utah 1998). As previously mentioned, defendant\'s
counsel at trial made no objection to jury instruction 26. However,
defendant now contends that it was plain error on the part of the trial
court ....

Our case law requires that to establish plain error, a defendant must
show that (1) the instruction was erroneous; (2) the error should have
been obvious to the trial court; and (3) but for the error, there would
be a reasonable likelihood for a more favorable outcome for the
defendant. *State v. Dunn*, 850 P.2d 1201, 1208-09 (Utah 1993). The
State concedes that the jury instruction was erroneous and does not
dispute that the error should have been obvious to the trial court, but
counters that any error caused thereby was harmless because there is no
evidence which would support the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt
that defendant killed the victim as a result of an extreme emotional
disturbance or in imperfect self-defense, either of which would justify
a verdict of manslaughter.

The State\'s contention that the trial court\'s error was harmless
requires us to examine the evidence that might support a verdict of
manslaughter. Utah Code Ann. section 76-5-203(3) provides two
circumstances** **where a charge of murder can be reduced to
manslaughter:

(3)(a) It is an affirmative defense to a charge of murder or attempted
murder that the defendant caused the death of another or attempted to
cause the death of another:

\(i\) under the influence of extreme emotional distress for which there
is a reasonable explanation or excuse; or

\(ii\) under a reasonable belief that the circumstances provided a legal
justification or excuse for his conduct, although the conduct was not
legally justifiable or excusable under the existing circumstances.

\(b\) under subsection (3)(a)(i), emotional stress does not include:

\(i\) \...

\(ii\) distress that is substantially caused by the defendant\'s own
conduct.

\(c\) The reasonableness of an explanation or excuse under Subsection
(3)(a)(i) or the reasonable belief of the actor under Subsection
(3)(a)(ii) shall be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person
under the then existing circumstances.

*Extreme Emotional Distress Manslaughter*

Turning first to consideration under subsection (3)(a)(i), we explained
in *State v. Bishop*, 753 P.2d 439, 471 (Utah 1988),** **that a person
suffers from an extreme emotional disturbance "when he is *exposed* to
extremely unusual and overwhelming stress" such that

the average reasonable person under that stress would have an extreme
emotional reaction to it, as a result of which he would experience a
loss of self-control and that person\'s reason would be overborne by
intense feelings such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive
agitation, or other similar emotions.

*Id.* However, an extreme emotional disturbance will not serve to reduce
murder to manslaughter if the actor brought about his own mental
disturbance. *Gardner*, 789 P.2d at 282-83; § 76-5-203(3)(b)(ii).

One interpretation of the evidence supports the necessity for a
manslaughter instruction under subsection (3)(a)(i). Brookes disclosed
to police that on the morning of the altercation Christopher was
irritated at him for beating Christopher at video games. As the boys
went to bed, Christopher went to the kitchen and retrieved a knife that
he began to throw in the air and catch. Christopher then lunged at
Brookes and began poking him with the knife. The boys wrestled over
control of the knife and in his** **anger, Brookes stabbed Christopher.
Brookes also suffered stab wounds to his hand. There was evidence that
Christopher had a reputation for being a "hothead" and losing his
temper, while Brookes was known to be cooperative and peaceful. Other
evidence supported the argument that Brookes had been bullied and pushed
around by his peers since he was in the third grade, and that all of
this "came out on Chris" when the boys fought over the knife.

Under this interpretation of the evidence, Brookes arguably did not
bring about the disturbance by his own conduct, but rather Christopher
initiated a violent and traumatic act by attacking Brookes with the
knife. Christopher\'s aggressive conduct could be found by a jury to
provide a reasonable excuse or explanation for Brookes\' stress and rage
that resulted in Brookes stabbing Christopher in the throat and chest.
According to the medical examiner, "the lethal wound to the victim\'s
throat was inflicted early in the struggle, while the victim\'s blood
pressure was still good." There is evidence that the wounds other than
the two potentially fatal stabs would not have been deadly. At the end
of the encounter, Brookes went to Christopher\'s** **mother\'s bedroom
to awake her and told her twice that Christopher had tried to stab him.
Brookes assisted her in her efforts to resuscitate Christopher. He was
peaceful and sobbing. Police officers who responded testified that
Brookes was not violent or a danger, but was cooperative and
nonthreatening.

The State responds that the plain intent of our statutory scheme is to
mitigate the crime of murder where a defendant\'s conduct was clearly
wrong but where the circumstances were so provocative that even a
reasonable person might have reacted similarly. But, the State asserts,
even assuming the truthfulness of defendant\'s version of the incident,
those facts would not constitute a "reasonable explanation or excuse"
for the stabbing of Christopher. The State asserts that no reasonable
person under the then existing circumstances, teased by a good friend
playing with a knife during a sleepover, would have become so enraged or
experience such an extreme emotional disturbance as to cause him to kill
that person by cutting his throat and stabbing him thirty-nine times.

We conclude that defendant was entitled to an instruction under
subsection (3)(a)(i) because** **a jury could conclude that Brookes
caused the death of Christopher "under the influence of extreme
emotional distress for which there is a reasonable explanation or
excuse." In holding that the defendant was entitled to an instruction
under subsection (3)(a)(i), we do not suggest that Brookes\' version of
the events that took place is the only reasonable interpretation of the
evidence. Most disturbing, of course, is the fact that the medical
examiner testified that Christopher had been stabbed thirty-nine times.
However, in *State v. Standiford*, 769 P.2d 254, 264, 266 (Utah 1988),
we approved of the giving of instructions for manslaughter and
self-defense based on the defendant\'s theory of the case where he had
stabbed the victim 107 times. See also *State v. Cloud*, 722 P.2d 750,
753-55 (Utah 1986), in which we held that the defendant would be
entitled to an instruction on extreme emotional distress manslaughter
where the victim had been stabbed twenty-seven times and died of
multiple critical wounds....

Brookes next contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his
conviction of evidence tampering.... After giving full weight to all of
the evidence supporting Brookes\' conviction of evidence tampering, we
conclude that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction....

Brookes\' conviction of murder is reversed, and the case is remanded for
a new trial. His conviction for tampering with evidence is reversed, and
the charge is dismissed for insufficiency of the evidence.

Notes on \'movie set\' manslaughter

 

On Oct. 21, 2021, during the production of the film "Rust" near Santa
Fe, New Mexico, the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, age 42, was
fatally shot when a revolver that the actor Alec Baldwin was rehearsing
with discharged a live round. The production's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez
Reed, was the person on the production team responsible for the safety
and handling of all weapons and ammunition used on the set. In this
instance, however, the assistant director, Dave Halls, was the person
who actually handed the prop gun, a replica Colt .45 pistol, to Baldwin.
Halls also had announced to Baldwin and others that the revolver given
to Baldwin was "cold," meaning it did not contain live ammunition
(although it might contain blank cartridges). Each time before actors
handle a firearm during rehearsal or filming, the armorer or another
person on the set should announce that a prop weapon is "cold," meaning
it cannot fire a live round.

Some actors make a personal practice of checking any firearms they
handle, although armorers know that many actors lack the expertise to
check firearms on their own, and that they are not required to do so by
standard film production safety protocols. SAG-AFTRA, the actor's union,
said that industry guidelines "do not make it the performer's
responsibility to check any firearm." But protocols for handling weapons
on film sets inevitably vary somewhat among armorers and production
teams. It is a common but not universal practice in the industry for the
armorer to open a prop gun and demonstrate to the actor that it was
empty. Ms. Gutierrez Reed told investigators that she did check each of
the six cartridges in the gun, but also remarked, "I wish I would've
checked it more." Both Gutierrez Reed and Halls told sheriff's
investigators that they did not inspect the pistol after the actors and
crew members returned from lunch that day.

Baldwin has denied that he pulled the trigger in this instance; he said
that the gun discharged unexpectedly after he pulled the hammer back and
let it go, as he was instructed to do during the filming of the scene.
He also noted that, as an actor, he cannot always follow the standard
gun safety protocol of never pointing a weapon at another person; he,
like other actors, is sometimes instructed by the director to point the
gun at another person, as he was in this instance.

Baldwin was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter for causing
Hutchins' death, but the prosecutor subsequently dismissed the charge
against Baldwin.

The assistant director, Halls, subsequently pled guilty to a misdemeanor
of negligent use of a deadly weapon. But the film's armorer, Gutierrez
Reed, is still facing a charge of involuntary manslaughter. The Criminal
Information reads in relevant part:

**State of New Mexico v. Hannah Gutierrez**

No. D-101-CR-202300040, June 22, 2023

1^st^ Judicial District Court, Sante Fe County

Special Prosecutors Kari T. Morrissey and Jason J. Lewis on behalf of
the State of New Mexico, state that on or about the dates listed below,
in said County and State, the above-named Defendant did commit the
crimes of:

[Count 1]{.underline}: Involuntary Manslaughter, on or about October 21,
2021, in Santa Fe County, New Mexico at the Bonanza Creek Ranch located
at 545 Bonanza Creek Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87508 the above-named
defendant did cause the death of Halyna Hutchins, committed in the
commission of an unlawful act, to wit: Negligent Use of a Deadly Weapon,
contrary to 30-7-4 (a)(3), a fourth degree felony, contrary to NMSA
1978, Section 30-2- 3(B) (1994).

*In the Alternative:*

[Count 1]{.underline}: Involuntary Manslaughter, on or about October 21,
2021, in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, at the Bonanza Creek Ranch located
at 545 Bonanza Creek Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87508 the above-named
Defendant did cause the death of Halyna Hutchins, committed in the
commission of a lawful act, which might produce death in an unlawful
manner or without due caution and circumspection, a fourth degree
felony, contrary to NMSA 1978, Section 30-2-3(B) (1994).

Consider New Mexico's statutes for involuntary manslaughter and for
negligent use of a deadly weapon, provided below. From what you know, is
the charge against Gutierrez Reed well-founded? What factual details
would you need to know to make a better-informed assessment? Even if you
conclude that the evidence is sufficient to convict Gutierrez Reed of
involuntary manslaughter, are there reasons that a prosecutor might use
her discretion not to charge Gutierrez Reed in this case?

As the alternate versions of the manslaughter charge against Gutierrez
Reed reflects, New Mexico defines involuntary manslaughter two different
ways---commission of an unlawful act, or commission of a lawful act
without due caution. What mens rea must the prosecution prove for each
version of the offense? Regarding the last question, in *State v.
Skippings* 150 N.M. 216 (N.M. 2011), the New Mexico Supreme Court has
said:

In New Mexico, \"the State must show at least criminal negligence to
convict a criminal defendant of involuntary manslaughter.\" State v.
Yarborough, 122 N.M. 596, 930 P.2d 131 (1996). Because involuntary
manslaughter is an unintentional killing, we only attach felony
liability where the actor has behaved with the requisite mens rea. This
Court has made clear that the criminal negligence standard applies to
\[both\] categories of involuntary manslaughter. State v. Salazar, 123
N.M. 778, 945 P.2d 996 (1997) (\"\[I\]nvoluntary manslaughter, whether
premised upon a lawful or unlawful act, requires a showing of criminal
negligence.\"). Criminal negligence exists where the defendant
\"act\[s\] with willful disregard of the rights or safety of others and
in a manner which endanger\[s\] any person or property.\" ... We also
require that the defendant must possess subjective knowledge \"of the
danger or risk to others posed by his or her actions.\"

Is the mental state requirement described in *Skippings* consistent with
negligence as defined in the Model Penal Code? With recklessness?

**N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-2-3. Manslaughter**.

Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice.

1.  Voluntary manslaughter consists of manslaughter committed upon a
    sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion. Whoever commits voluntary
    manslaughter is guilty of a third degree felony resulting in the
    death of a human being.

2.  Involuntary manslaughter consists of manslaughter committed in the
    commission of an unlawful act not amounting to felony, or in the
    commission of a lawful act which might produce death in an unlawful
    manner or without due caution and circumspection.

Whoever commits involuntary manslaughter is guilty of a fourth degree
felony.

**N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-7-4. Negligent use of a deadly weapon**.

1.  Negligent use of a deadly weapon consists of:

\(1\) discharging a firearm into any building or vehicle or so as to
knowingly endanger a person or his property;

\(2\) carrying a firearm while under the influence of an intoxicant or
narcotic;

\(3\) endangering the safety of another by handling or using a firearm
or other deadly weapon in a negligent manner; or

\(4\) discharging a firearm within one hundred fifty yards of a dwelling
or building, not including abandoned or vacated buildings on public
lands during hunting seasons, without the permission of the owner or
lessees thereof....

Whoever commits negligent use of a deadly weapon is guilty of a petty
misdemeanor.

 

 

 

Notes on corporate manslaughter

 

Not infrequently, corporations are convicted of manslaughter when their
operations negligently cause deaths. California's largest power utility,
Pacific Gas & Electric, has been convicted of dozens of homicides
resulting from wildfires---including 84 counts of involuntary
manslaughter from he 2018 Camp Fire---caused by its negligent
maintenance and operation of its electrical infrastructure. Consider the
following federal district court report issued upon the expiration of
PG&E's probation sentence imposed after its 2017 jury trial conviction
for charges based on 2010 pipeline explosion that caused five deaths.
California's involuntary manslaughter statute and accompanying jury
instruction follow. See also Ivan Penn, *PG&E Charged With Crimes in
2019 California Wildfire,* N.Y.

United States v. Pacific Gas and Electric

No. CR 14-0175 WHA (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2022)

**Final Comments of District Court Upon Expiration of PG&E's Probation**

William Alsup, J.: PG&E's five-year term of felony probation will end on
January 25, 2022.... As the supervising district judge, I now offer this
parting observation.

Rehabilitation of a criminal offender remains the paramount goal of
probation. During these five years of criminal probation, we have tried
hard to rehabilitate PG&E. As the supervising district judge, however, I
must acknowledge failure.

While on probation, PG&E has set at least 31 wildfires, burned nearly
one and one-half million acres, burned 23,956 structures, and killed 113
Californians. PG&E has pled guilty to 84 manslaughter charges for its
ignition of the 2018 Camp Fire in Butte County, is facing five felony
and 28 misdemeanor counts arising out of the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma
County (that county's largest wildfire ever), is facing pending
involuntary manslaughter charges arising out of the 2020 Zogg Fire in
Shasta County .... So, in these five years, PG&E has gone on a crime
spree and will emerge from probation as a continuing menace to
California.

Almost all of the survivors of these fires are still waiting for
compensation. Many hundreds who lost their homes endure in travel
trailers because they have not yet been compensated. Meanwhile, PG&E
management pays itself handsome salaries and bonuses, all paid from
revenues collected from customers. This unfairness should tug at our
conscience....

We remain trapped in a tragic era of PG&E wildfires because for decades
it neglected its duties concerning hazard-tree removal and vegetation
clearance, even though such duties were required by California's Public
Resource Code. In time, this neglect led to hazard trees and limbs
falling on its distribution lines and sparking wildfires or becoming
"ground faults" (wherein the tree remains against a live wire and
conducts sufficient electrical power to the earth to overheat and
explode in flames). PG&E's backlog of unattended trees and vegetation
was staggering at the outset of probation. As probation ends, PG&E
remains at least seven years (my estimate) from coming close to being
current. During its criminal probation, all or virtually all of the
wildfires started by PG&E distribution lines have involved hazard trees.

PG&E has blamed global warming, drought, and bark beetles. It's true
that those things made the wildfires worse. But they were reasons to
step up compliance rather than slack off. And those things didn't start
those fires. PG&E did that.

PG&E has instituted some important wildfire safety reforms. These
include its Public Safety Power Shutoffs, its enhanced vegetation
management work, and its Fast Trip Mitigation protocol. Yet, PG&E's
swath of devastation persists.

One systemic cause, in my view, is that for decades, PG&E has been
outsourcing to independent contractors its statutory responsibility for
finding and removing hazard trees and for maintaining vegetation
clearances. A large part of the wildfire problem, as the Monitor has
pointed out, has been sloppy inspection and clearance work (almost
exclusively outsourced to independent contractors).

This outsourcing seems to have been done for at least two reasons. One
has been to save on salary and benefits, the usual reason companies go
from an "employee" model to an "independent contractor" model. A second,
more pertinent here, has been to manufacture a strategic defense in
wildfire litigation. Time and again, we have heard PG&E blame its
outside contractors....

 

**Cal. Penal Code § 192: Manslaughter**

Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. It
is of three kinds:

\(a\) Voluntary---upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.

\(b\) Involuntary---in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting
to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce
death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection.
This subdivision shall not apply to acts committed in the driving of a
vehicle.

\(c\) Vehicular....

California Model Jury Instructions explain this law in the context of
corporate defendants as follows:

**Involuntary Manslaughter: Failure to Perform Legal Duty**

To find a corporation guilty of involuntary manslaughter in violation of
Penal Code section 192(b) based on failure to perform a legal duty the
evidence must prove that:

1.  The corporation had a legal duty to the decedent;

2.  The corporation failed to perform that legal duty;

3.  The corporation's failure was criminally negligent; AND

4.  The corporation's failure caused the death of decedent.

A public utility has a legal duty to construct, maintain, and operate
its electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the
risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by those electrical lines and
equipment.

Criminal negligence involves more than ordinary carelessness,
inattention, or mistake in judgment. A corporation acts with criminal
negligence when:

1.  It acts in a reckless way that creates a high risk of death or great
    bodily injury; and

2.  A reasonable person would have known that acting in that way would
    create such a risk.

In other words, a corporation acts with criminal negligence when the way
it acts is so different from how an ordinarily careful person would act
in the same situation that its act amounts to disregard for human life
or indifference to the consequences of that act.

*Causation*: An act causes death if the death is the direct, natural,
and probable consequence of the act and the death would not have
happened without the act. A natural and probable consequence is one that
a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual
intervenes. In deciding whether a consequence is natural and probable,
consider all of the circumstances established by the evidence. There may
be more than one cause of death. An act causes death, only if it is a
substantial factor in causing the death. A substantial factor is more
than a trivial or remote factor. However, it does not need to be the
only factor that causes the death.

State ex rel. Thomas v. Duncan

 

Arizona Court of Appeal

216 Ariz. 260, 165 P.3d 238 (2007)

BARKER, Judge.

This special action presents the issue of whether evidence of
justification in a manslaughter case that would be prohibited under
Arizona Revised Statutes \[§§\] 13-401(A), -412(C) and -417(C) (2001) if
a justification defense were sought, may be admissible if it is relevant
on a separate issue. The State of Arizona, Petitioner, asks this court
to reverse the trial court\'s order permitting William Joseph Reagan,
Jr., Real Party in Interest, to present such evidence to a jury. For the
reasons that follow, we accept jurisdiction and deny relief.

On October 29, 2005, Reagan was driving his truck with his brother
seated in the passenger seat. Reagan alleges that he was involved in a
road rage incident. He claims that the occupants of the other vehicle
involved in the incident "made threats that led him to believe that he
and his brother were in danger of being seriously injured or perhaps
killed." Reagan tried to drive away, but alleges that the other vehicle
chased him. Reagan was "fearful and remembers driving quickly because
they were being chased and he wanted to get away from the danger."
During later investigation, witnesses claimed to have seen another truck
either racing with or chasing Reagan\'s car. Reagan ran a red light
while driving approximately seventy-nine to eighty-four miles per hour
in a forty mile per hour zone and struck the victim\'s car, killing her.
Reagan had a blood alcohol content of .093 at the time.

The State filed a motion to preclude Reagan from introducing evidence of
the chase, arguing it went to the justification defense and was
prohibited pursuant to A.R.S. §§ 13-401(A), -412(C), and -417(C) (2001).
Following oral argument, the trial court denied the State\'s motion to
preclude. The State filed this special action.

Special action jurisdiction is highly discretionary. Jurisdiction is
appropriate when there is no adequate remedy by way of appeal.... Should
Reagan be acquitted, the State could not appeal the trial court\'s
order. Under these circumstances, the State does not have an adequate
remedy by way of appeal. Furthermore, this special action presents a
purely legal issue of first impression that is of statewide importance.
Accordingly, special action jurisdiction is appropriate here.

The State raises two issues. First, does A.R.S. § 13-401(A) preclude the
admission of evidence that is relevant to a justification defense when
the defendant is seeking to use the evidence for other legitimate
purposes? Second, did the trial court err in its determination that the
disputed evidence in this case was relevant to the mens rea element of
reckless manslaughter?

When construing a statute, "\[w\]e first consider the statute\'s
language." *Zamora v. Reinstein*, 185 Ariz. 272, 275, 915 P.2d 1227,
1230 (1996).... For purposes of the present case, the justification
defense here is an affirmative defense that the defendant must prove by
a preponderance of the evidence. A justification defense is unavailable
in certain instances, as provided for in A.R.S. § 13-401(A):

Even though a person is justified under this chapter in threatening or
using physical force or deadly physical force against another, if in
doing so such person recklessly injures or kills an innocent third
person, the justification afforded by this chapter is unavailable in a
prosecution for the reckless injury or killing of the innocent third
person.

The unavailability provision applies to the defense of self-defense and
other justification defenses.... The defenses of duress and necessity
are two of the justification defenses set forth in that chapter that are
also specifically made unavailable "for offenses involving homicide or
serious physical injury." A.R.S. §§ 13-412(C), -417(C) (2001). Duress
and necessity are therefore unavailable in this case irrespective of §
13-401(A).

Reagan, however, does not claim that he should be able to raise an
affirmative defense of justification, be it one of duress, necessity or
otherwise. Rather, he asserts that the evidence of the chase is relevant
to the mens rea element of reckless manslaughter. The State argues that
by introducing evidence that is relevant to a justification defense,
Reagan is raising the defense despite his assertion to the contrary. The
State urges this court to hold that § 13-401, in prosecutions for the
reckless injury or killing of an innocent third person, is an absolute
bar to admitting evidence that might support a justification defense
even if the evidence is properly admissible for other purposes. We do
not agree.

The language in the statutes cited by the State bars the use of
*defenses* to a charged offense. *See* A.R.S. §§ 13-401(A) ("the
justification *afforded by this chapter* \[chapter 4: Justification\] is
unavailable in a prosecution for the reckless injury or killing of the
innocent third person"), -412(C) ("*the defense* provided by subsection
A \[duress\] is unavailable for offenses involving homicide or serious
physical injury"), and -417(C) ("An accused person may not assert *the
defense* under subsection A \[necessity\] for offenses involving
homicide or serious physical injury.") (emphasis added). Thus, by the
statutes\' own terms, they only restrict the availability of *defenses*.
They do not bar the use of all *evidence* when admission of that
evidence is sought for a separate, but permissible purpose.

The idea that a court may admit evidence for a legitimate purpose even
though the evidence is inadmissible for another purpose is not foreign
to the law of evidence.... Thus, we hold that the trial court may admit
evidence tending to show justification in prosecutions for the reckless
injury or killing of an innocent third person if that evidence is
otherwise admissible for a separate purpose....

Having determined that A.R.S. §§ 13-401(A), -412(C) and -417(C) do not
bar evidence of justification when it is admissible for a separate,
permissible purpose, we now turn to whether such a purpose exists in
this case. Reagan argues that the evidence is admissible as to the issue
of mens rea for "recklessly" as provided in A.R.S. § 13-1103....

The crime of manslaughter, with which Reagan is charged, is defined as
"\[r\]ecklessly causing the death of another person." A.R.S. §
13-1103(A)(1). The term "recklessly" is defined to include the
requirement that "a person is *aware of* and *consciously disregards* a
substantial and unjustifiable risk." A.R.S. § 13-105(9)(c) (emphasis
added).

Reagan argues that evidence that he was being chased and feared for his
and his brother\'s lives is relevant and admissible as to the mens rea
"recklessly". Specifically, he argues that because of the chase he was
not "aware of" nor did he "consciously disregard" the risk. If the State
cannot satisfy this element, then acquittal on the manslaughter charge
would be required \[although could still be convicted of the lesser
included offense of negligent homicide, which does not require such
awareness.\]...

Similarly, here, evidence of the alleged chase at the time Reagan ran
the red light is evidence the jury may consider in determining whether
the State has met its burden to show that Reagan was "aware of and
consciously disregard\[ed\]" the risk at issue here. Being "aware" of
the risk and the "justifiability" of the risk are also separate and
distinct inquiries. The use for this purpose is thus for a purpose
different from that prohibited by the justification statutes.

In sum, the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence of the
chase. We need not consider the defendant\'s constitutional grounds for
the admissibility of the evidence as we resolve the case on other
grounds. For the foregoing reasons, we accept jurisdiction and deny
relief.

People v. Goetz

 

New York Court of Appeals

497 N.E.2d 41 (N.Y. 1986)

WACHTLER, J.

A Grand Jury has indicted defendant on attempted** **murder, assault,
and other charges for having shot and wounded four youths on a New York
City subway train after one or two of the youths approached him and
asked for \$ 5. The lower courts, concluding that the prosecutor\'s
charge to the Grand Jury on the defense of justification was erroneous,
have dismissed the attempted murder, assault and weapons possession
charges. We now reverse and reinstate all counts of the indictment.

I.

The precise circumstances of the incident giving rise to the charges
against defendant are disputed, and ultimately it will be for a trial
jury to determine what occurred. We feel it necessary, however, to
provide some factual background to properly frame the legal issues
before us. Accordingly, we have summarized the facts as they appear from
the evidence before the Grand Jury....

On Saturday afternoon, December 22, 1984, Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey,
James Ramseur, and Barry Allen boarded** **an IRT express subway train
in The Bronx and headed south toward lower Manhattan. The four youths
rode together in the rear portion of the seventh car of the train. Two
of the four, Ramseur and Cabey, had screwdrivers inside their coats,
which they said were to be used to break into the coin boxes of video
machines.

Defendant Bernhard Goetz boarded this subway train at 14th Street in
Manhattan and sat down on a bench towards the rear section of the same
car occupied by the four youths. Goetz was carrying an unlicensed .38
caliber pistol loaded with five rounds of ammunition in a waistband
holster. The train left the 14th Street station and headed towards
Chambers Street.

It appears from the evidence before the Grand Jury that Canty approached
Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and stated "give me five
dollars." Neither Canty nor any of the other youths displayed a weapon.
Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out his handgun and firing four
shots in rapid succession. The first shot hit Canty in the chest; the
second struck Allen in the back; the third went through Ramseur\'s arm
and into his left side; the fourth was fired at Cabey, who apparently
was then standing in** **the corner of the car, but missed, deflecting
instead off of a wall of the conductor\'s cab. After Goetz briefly
surveyed the scene around him, he fired another shot at Cabey, who then
was sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet entered the rear of
Cabey\'s side and severed his spinal cord.

All but two of the other passengers fled the car when, or immediately
after, the shots were fired. The conductor, who had been in the next
car, heard the shots and instructed the motorman to radio for emergency
assistance. The conductor then went into the car where the shooting
occurred and saw Goetz sitting on a bench, the injured youths lying on
the floor or slumped against a seat, and two women who had apparently
taken cover, also lying on the floor. Goetz told the conductor that the
four youths had tried to rob him.

While the conductor was aiding the youths, Goetz headed towards the
front of the car. The train had stopped just before the Chambers Street
station and Goetz went between two of the cars, jumped onto the tracks
and fled. Police and ambulance crews arrived at the scene shortly
thereafter. Ramseur and Canty, initially listed in
critical** **condition, have fully recovered. Cabey remains paralyzed,
and has suffered some degree of brain damage.

On December 31, 1984, Goetz surrendered to police in Concord, New
Hampshire, identifying himself as the gunman being sought for the subway
shootings in New York nine days earlier. Later that day, after receiving
*Miranda* warnings, he made two lengthy statements, both of which were
tape recorded with his permission. In the statements, which are
substantially similar, Goetz admitted that he had been illegally
carrying a handgun in New York City for three years. He stated that he
had first purchased a gun in 1981 after he had been injured in a
mugging. Goetz also revealed that twice between 1981 and 1984 he had
successfully warded off assailants simply by displaying the pistol.

According to Goetz\'s statement, the first contact he had with the four
youths came when Canty, sitting or lying on the bench across from him,
asked "how are you," to which he replied "fine." Shortly thereafter,
Canty, followed by one of the other youths, walked over to the defendant
and stood to his left, while the other two youths remained to his right,
in the corner of the subway car. Canty then** **said "give me five
dollars." Goetz stated that he knew from the smile on Canty\'s face that
they wanted to "play with me." Although he was certain that none of the
youths had a gun, he had a fear, based on prior experiences, of being
"maimed."

Goetz then established "a pattern of fire," deciding specifically to
fire from left to right. His stated intention at that point was to
"murder \[the four youths\], to hurt them, to make them suffer as much
as possible." When Canty again requested money, Goetz stood up, drew his
weapon, and began firing, aiming for the center of the body of each of
the four. Goetz recalled that the first two he shot "tried to run
through the crowd \[but\] they had nowhere to run." Goetz then turned to
his right to "go after the other two." One of these two "tried to run
through the wall of the train, but ... he had nowhere to go." The other
youth (Cabey) "tried pretending that he wasn\'t with \[the others\]" by
standing still, holding on to one of the subway hand straps, and not
looking at Goetz. Goetz nonetheless fired his fourth shot at him. He
then ran back to the first two youths to make sure they had been "taken
care of." Seeing that** **they had both been shot, he spun back to check
on the latter two. Goetz noticed that the youth who had been standing
still was now sitting on a bench and seemed unhurt. As Goetz told the
police, "I said \'\[you\] seem to be all right, here\'s another\'", and
he then fired the shot which severed Cabey\'s spinal cord. Goetz added
that "if I was a little more under self-control ... I would have put the
barrel against his forehead and fired." He also admitted that "if I had
had more \[bullets\], I would have shot them again, and again, and
again."

II\.

... The matter was presented to a Grand Jury in January 1985, with the
prosecutor seeking an indictment for attempted murder, assault, reckless
endangerment, and criminal possession of a weapon. Neither the defendant
nor any of the wounded youths testified before his Grand Jury. On
January 25, 1985, the Grand Jury indicted defendant on one count of
criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Penal Law §
265.02), for possessing the gun used in the subway** **shootings, and
two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree
(Penal Law § 265.01), for possessing two other guns in his apartment
building. It dismissed, however, the attempted murder and other charges
stemming from the shootings themselves.

Several weeks after the Grand Jury\'s action, the People, asserting that
they had newly available evidence, moved for an order authorizing them
to resubmit the dismissed charges to a second Grand Jury .... Two of the
four youths, Canty and Ramseur, testified. Among the other witnesses
were four passengers from the seventh car of the subway who had seen
some portions of the incident. Goetz again chose not to testify, though
the tapes of his two statements were played for the grand jurors, as had
been done with the first Grand Jury.

On March 27, 1985, the second Grand Jury filed a 10-count indictment,
containing four charges of attempted murder (Penal Law §§ 110.00, 125.25
\[1\]), four charges of assault in the** **first degree (Penal Law §
120.10 \[1\]), one charge of reckless endangerment in the first degree
(Penal Law § 120.25), and one charge of criminal possession of a weapon
in the second degree (Penal Law § 265.03 \[possession of loaded firearm
with intent to use it unlawfully against another\])....

On October** **14, 1985, Goetz moved to dismiss the charges contained in
the second indictment alleging, among other things, that the evidence
before the second Grand Jury was not legally sufficient to establish the
offenses charged, and that the prosecutor\'s instructions to that Grand
Jury on the defense of justification were erroneous and prejudicial to
the defendant so as to render its proceedings defective.

On November 25, 1985, while the motion to dismiss was pending before
Criminal Term, a column appeared in the *New York Daily News* containing
an interview which the columnist had conducted with Darryl Cabey the
previous day in Cabey\'s hospital room. The columnist claimed that Cabey
had told him in this interview that the other three youths had all
approached Goetz with the intention of robbing him. The day after the
column was published, a New York City police officer informed the
prosecutor that he had been one of the first police officers to enter
the subway car after the shootings, and that Canty had said to him "we
were going to rob \[Goetz\]." The prosecutor immediately disclosed this
information to** **the court and to defense counsel, adding that ...
none of the police reports filed on the incident contained any such
information. Goetz then orally expanded his motion to dismiss, asserting
that resubmission of the charges voted by the second Grand Jury was
required under *People v Pelchat* (62 NY2d 97) because it appeared, from
this new information, that Ramseur and Canty had committed perjury.

In an order dated January 21, 1986, Criminal Term granted Goetz\'s
motion to the extent that it dismissed all counts of the second
indictment, other than the reckless endangerment charge, with leave to
resubmit these charges to a third Grand Jury. The court, after
inspection of the Grand Jury minutes, first rejected Goetz\'s contention
that there was not legally sufficient evidence to support the charges.
It held, however, that the prosecutor, in a supplemental charge
elaborating upon the justification defense, had erroneously introduced
an objective element into this defense by instructing the grand jurors
to consider whether Goetz\'s conduct was that of a "reasonable man
in** **\[Goetz\'s\] situation." The court ... concluded that the
statutory test for whether the use of deadly force is justified to
protect a person should be wholly subjective, focusing entirely on the
defendant\'s state of mind when he used such force. It concluded that
dismissal was required for this error because the justification issue
was at the heart of the case....

On appeal by the People, a divided Appellate Division affirmed Criminal
Term\'s dismissal of the charges. The plurality opinion by Justice
Kassal ... agreed with Criminal Term\'s reasoning on the justification
issue, stating that the grand jurors should have been instructed to
consider only the defendant\'s subjective beliefs as to the need to use
deadly force. Justice Kupferman concurred in the result reached by the
plurality on the ground that the prosecutor\'s charge did not adequately
apprise the grand jurors of the need to consider Goetz\'s own background
and learning....

Justice Asch, in a dissenting opinion in which Justice Wallach
concurred, disagreed .... On the justification question, he opined that
the statute requires consideration of both the defendant\'s subjective
beliefs and whether a reasonable person in defendant\'s situation would
have had such beliefs. Accordingly, he found no error in the
prosecutor\'s introduction of an objective element into the
justification defense....

We agree with the dissenters that neither the prosecutor\'s** **charge
to the Grand Jury on justification nor the information which came to
light while the motion to dismiss was pending required dismissal of any
of the charges in the second indictment.

III\.

Penal Law article 35 recognizes the defense of justification, which
"permits the use of force under certain circumstances" *(People v
McManus*, 67 NY2d 541, 545). One such set of circumstances pertains to
the use of force in defense of a person, encompassing both self-defense
and defense of a third person (Penal Law § 35.15). Penal Law § 35.15(1)
sets forth the general principles governing all such uses of force:
"\[a\] person may \... use physical force upon another person when and
to the extent he *reasonably believes* such to be necessary to defend
himself or a third person from what he *reasonably believes* to be the
use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person"
(emphasis added).

Section 35.15(2) sets forth further limitations on these general
principles with respect to the use of "deadly physical force": "A person
may not use deadly physical force upon another person under
circumstances specified in subdivision one unless (a) He *reasonably
believes* that such other person is using or about to use deadly
physical force ... or (b) He *reasonably believes* that such other
person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible
rape, forcible sodomy or robbery" (emphasis added). \[Section
35.15(2)(a) further provides, however, that even under these
circumstances a person ordinarily must retreat "if he knows that he can
with complete safety as to himself and others avoid the necessity of
\[using deadly physical force\] by retreating."\]

Thus, consistent with most justification provisions, Penal Law § 35.15
permits the use of deadly physical force only where requirements as to
triggering conditions and the necessity of a particular response are met
*(see*, Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses § 121\[a\], at 2). As to the
triggering conditions, the statute requires that the actor "reasonably
believes" that another person either is using or about to use deadly
physical force or is committing or attempting to commit one of certain
enumerated felonies, including robbery. As to the need for the use of
deadly physical force as a response, the statute requires that the actor
"reasonably believes" that such force is necessary to avert the
perceived threat. \[*In a footnote, the court added*: While the portion
of section 35.15(2)(b) pertaining to the use of deadly physical force to
avert a felony such as robbery does not contain a separate "retreat"
requirement, it is clear from reading subdivisions (1) and (2) of
section 35.15 together, as the statute requires, that the general
"necessity" requirement in subdivision (1) applies to all uses of force
under section 35.15, including the use of deadly physical force under
subdivision (2)(b).\]

Because the evidence before the second Grand Jury included
statements** **by Goetz that he acted to protect himself from being
maimed or to avert a robbery, the prosecutor correctly chose to charge
the justification defense in section 35.15 to the Grand Jury. The
prosecutor properly instructed the grand jurors to consider whether the
use of deadly physical force was justified to prevent either serious
physical injury or a robbery, and, in doing so, to separately analyze
the defense with respect to each of the charges. He elaborated upon the
prerequisites for the use of deadly physical force essentially by
reading or paraphrasing the language in Penal Law § 35.15. The defense
does not contend that he committed any error in this portion of the
charge.

When the prosecutor had completed his charge, one of the grand jurors
asked for clarification of the term "reasonably believes." The
prosecutor responded by instructing the grand jurors that they were to
consider the circumstances of the incident and determine "whether the
defendant\'s conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant\'s
situation." It is this response by the prosecutor---and specifically his
use** **of "a reasonable man"---which is the basis for the dismissal of
the charges by the lower courts. As expressed repeatedly in the
Appellate Division\'s plurality opinion, because section 35.15 uses the
term *"he* reasonably believes", the appropriate test, according to that
court, is whether a defendant\'s beliefs and reactions were "reasonable
*to him*." Under that reading of the statute, a jury which believed a
defendant\'s testimony that he felt that his own actions were warranted
and were reasonable would have to acquit him, regardless of what anyone
else in defendant\'s situation might have concluded. Such an
interpretation defies the ordinary meaning and significance of the term
"reasonably" in a statute, and misconstrues the clear intent of the
Legislature, in enacting section 35.15, to retain an objective element
as part of any provision authorizing the use of deadly physical
force....

In 1961 the Legislature established a Commission to undertake a complete
revision of the Penal Law and the Criminal Code. The impetus for the
decision to update the Penal Law came in part from the drafting of the
Model Penal Code by the American Law Institute, as well as from the fact
that the existing law was poorly organized and in many aspects
antiquated. Following the submission by the** **Commission of several
reports and proposals, the Legislature approved the present Penal Law in
1965, and it became effective on September 1, 1967. The drafting of the
general provisions of the new Penal Law, including the article on
justification, was particularly influenced by the Model Penal Code
*(see* ... Wechsler, *Codification of Criminal Law in the United States:
The Model Penal Code*, 68 Colum L Rev 1425, 1428). While using the Model
Penal Code provisions on justification as general guidelines, however,
the drafters of the new Penal Law did not simply adopt them verbatim.

The provisions of the Model Penal Code with respect to the use of deadly
force in self-defense reflect the position of its drafters that any
culpability which arises from a mistaken belief in the need to use such
force should be no greater than the culpability such a mistake would
give rise to if it were made with respect to an element of a crime.
Accordingly, under Model Penal Code § 3.04(2)(b), a defendant charged
with murder (or attempted murder) need only show that he *"\[believed\]*
that \[the use of deadly force\] was necessary to protect himself
against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or \[forcible\] sexual
intercourse" to prevail on a self-defense claim (emphasis added). If the
defendant\'s belief was wrong, and was recklessly, or negligently
formed, however, he may be convicted of the type of homicide charge
requiring only a reckless or negligent, as the case may be, criminal
intent *(see*, Model Penal Code § 3.09(2)....

New York did not follow the Model Penal Code\'s equation of a mistake as
to the need to use deadly force with a mistake negating an element of a
crime, choosing instead to use a single statutory section which would
provide either a complete defense or no defense at all to a defendant
charged with any crime involving the use of deadly force. The drafters
of the new Penal Law adopted in large part the structure and content of
Model Penal Code § 3.04, but, crucially, inserted the word "reasonably"
before "believes."

The plurality below agreed with defendant\'s argument that the change in
the statutory language from "reasonable ground," used prior to 1965, to
"he reasonably believes" in Penal Law § 35.15 evinced a legislative
intent to conform to the subjective standard** **contained in Model
Penal Code § 3.04. This argument, however, ignores the plain
significance of the insertion of "reasonably." ... Interpreting the
statute to require only that the defendant\'s belief was "reasonable to
*him*," as done by the plurality below, would hardly be different from
requiring only a genuine belief; in either case, the defendant\'s own
perceptions could completely exonerate him from any criminal liability.

We cannot lightly impute to the Legislature an intent to fundamentally
alter the principles of justification to allow the perpetrator of a
serious crime to go free simply because that person believed his actions
were reasonable and necessary to prevent some perceived harm. To
completely exonerate such an individual, no matter how aberrational or
bizarre his thought patterns, would allow citizens to set their own
standards** **for the permissible use of force. It would also allow a
legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill or perform
acts of violence with impunity, contrary to fundamental principles of
justice and criminal law.

We can only conclude that the Legislature retained a reasonableness
requirement to avoid giving a license for such actions. The plurality\'s
interpretation, as the dissenters below recognized, excises the impact
of the word "reasonably." ...

The change from "reasonable ground" to "reasonably believes" is better
explained by the fact that the drafters of section 35.15 were proposing
a single section which, for the first time, would govern both the use of
ordinary force and deadly force in self-defense or defense of another.
Under the 1909 Penal Law and its predecessors, the use of ordinary force
was governed by separate sections which, at least by their literal
terms, required that the** **defendant was *in fact* responding to an
unlawful assault, and not just that he had a reasonable ground for
believing that such an assault was occurring.... Following the example
of the Model Penal Code, the drafters of section 35.15 eliminated this
sharp dichotomy between the use of ordinary force and deadly force in
defense of a person. Not surprisingly then, the integrated section
reflects the wording of Model Penal Code § 3.04, with the addition of
"reasonably" to incorporate the long-standing requirement of "reasonable
ground" for the use of deadly force and apply it to the use of ordinary
force as well....

In *People v Collice* (41 NY2d 906), we rejected the position that
section 35.15 contains a wholly subjective standard. The defendant in
*Collice* asserted, on appeal, that the trial court had erred in
refusing to charge the justification defense. We upheld the trial
court\'s action because we concluded that, even if the defendant had
actually believed that he was threatened with the imminent use of deadly
physical force, the evidence clearly indicated that "his reactions were
not those of a reasonable man acting in self-defense" *(id*., at p
907)....

Goetz also argues that the introduction of an objective element \[in the
self-defense standard\] will preclude a jury from considering factors
such as the prior experiences of a given actor and thus, require it to
make a determination of "reasonableness" without regard to the actual
circumstances of a particular incident. This argument, however, falsely
presupposes that an objective standard means that the background and
other relevant** **characteristics of a particular actor must be
ignored. To the contrary, we have frequently noted that a determination
of reasonableness must be based on the "circumstances" facing a
defendant or his "situation" *(see, e.g., People v Ligouri*, 284 NY 309,
316, *supra; People v Lumsden*, 201 NY 264, 268, *supra)*. Such terms
encompass more than the physical movements of the potential assailant.
As just discussed, these terms include any relevant knowledge the
defendant had about that person. They also necessarily bring in the
physical attributes of all persons involved, including the defendant.
Furthermore, the defendant\'s circumstances encompass any prior
experiences he had which could provide a reasonable basis for a belief
that another person\'s intentions were to injure or rob him or that the
use of deadly force was necessary under the circumstances.

Accordingly, a jury should be instructed to consider this type of
evidence in weighing the defendant\'s actions. The jury must first
determine whether the defendant had the requisite beliefs under section
35.15, that is, whether he believed deadly force was necessary to avert
the imminent use of deadly force or** **the commission of one of the
felonies enumerated therein. If the People do not prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he did not have such beliefs, then the jury must
also consider whether these beliefs were reasonable. The jury would have
to determine, in light of all the "circumstances", as explicated above,
if a reasonable person could have had these beliefs.

The prosecutor\'s instruction to the second Grand Jury that it had to
determine whether, under the circumstances, Goetz\'s conduct was that of
a reasonable man in his situation was thus essentially an accurate
charge. It is true that the prosecutor did not elaborate on the meaning
of "circumstances" or "situation" and inform the grand jurors that they
could consider, for example, the prior experiences Goetz related in his
statement to the police. We have held, however, that a Grand Jury need
not be instructed on the law with the same degree of precision as the
petit jury. This lesser standard is premised upon the different
functions of the Grand Jury and the** **petit jury: the former
determines whether sufficient evidence exists to accuse a person of a
crime and thereby subject him to criminal prosecution; the latter
ultimately determines the guilt or innocence of the accused, and may
convict only where the People have proven his guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt....

The Grand Jury has indicted Goetz. It will now be for the petit jury to
decide whether the prosecutor can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
Goetz\'s reactions were unreasonable and therefore excessive....
Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and
the dismissed counts of the indictment reinstated.

**\[ ... \]**

Justice White

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case requires us to determine the constitutionality of the use of
deadly force to prevent the escape of an apparently unarmed suspected
felon. We conclude that such force may not be used unless it is
necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to
believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious
physical injury to the officer or others.

I

At about 10:45 p. m. on October 3, 1974, Memphis Police Officers Elton
Hymon and Leslie Wright were dispatched to answer a "prowler inside
call." Upon arriving at the scene they saw a woman standing on her porch
and gesturing toward the adjacent house.[^19] She told them she had
heard glass breaking and that "they" or "someone" was breaking in next
door. While Wright radioed the dispatcher to say that they were on the
scene, Hymon went behind the house. He heard a door slam and saw someone
run across the backyard. The fleeing suspect, who was
appellee-respondent's decedent, Edward Garner, stopped at a 6-feet-high
chain link fence at the edge of the yard. With the aid of a flashlight,
Hymon was able to see Garner's face and hands. He saw no sign of a
weapon, and, though not certain, was "reasonably sure" and "figured"
that Garner was unarmed. App. 41, 56; Record 219. He thought Garner was
17 or 18 years old and about 5\' 5\" *or 5\'* 7\" tall.[^20] While
Garner was crouched at the base of the fence, Hymon called out "police,
halt" and took a few steps toward him. Garner then began to climb over
the fence. Convinced that if Garner made it over the fence he would
elude capture,[^21] Hymon shot him. The bullet hit Garner in the back of
the head. Garner was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he died on
the operating table. Ten dollars and a purse taken from the house were
found on his body.[^22]

In using deadly force to prevent the escape, Hymon was acting under the
authority of a Tennessee statute and pursuant to Police Department
policy. The statute provides that "\[i\]f, after notice of the intention
to arrest the defendant, he either flee or forcibly resist, the officer
may use all the necessary means to effect the arrest." Tenn. Code Ann.
§40-7-108 (1982).[^23] The Department policy was slightly more
restrictive than the statute, but still allowed the use of deadly force
in cases of burglary. App. 140-144. The incident was reviewed by the
Memphis Police Firearm's Review Board and presented to a grand jury.
Neither took any action. *Id.,* at 57.

Garner's father then brought this action in the Federal District Court
for the Western District of Tennessee, seeking damages under 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983 for asserted violations of Garner's constitutional rights. The
complaint alleged that the shooting violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. It
named as defendants Officer Hymon, the Police Department, its Director,
and the Mayor and city of Memphis. After a 3-day bench trial, the
District Court entered judgment for all defendants. It dismissed the
claims against the Mayor and the Director for lack of evidence. It then
concluded that Hymon's actions were authorized by the Tennessee statute,
which in turn was constitutional. Hymon had employed the only reasonable
and practicable means of preventing Garner's escape. Garner had
"recklessly and heedlessly attempted to vault over the fence to escape,
thereby assuming the risk of being fired upon." App. to Pet. for Cert.
A10.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed with regard to
Hymon, finding that he had acted in good-faith reliance on the Tennessee
statute and was therefore within the scope of his qualified immunity.
600 F. 2d 52 (1979). It remanded for reconsideration of the possible
liability of the city, however, in light of *Monell* v. *New York City
Dept. of Social Services,* 436 U. S. 658 (1978), which had come down
after the District Court's decision. The District Court was directed to
consider whether a city enjoyed a qualified immunity, whether the use of
deadly force and hollow point bullets in these circumstances was
constitutional, and whether any unconstitutional municipal conduct
flowed from a "policy or custom" as required for liability under
*Monell.* 600 F. 2d, at 54-55.

The District Court concluded that *Monell* did not affect its decision.
While acknowledging some doubt as to the possible immunity of the city,
it found that the statute, and Hymon's actions, were constitutional.
Given this conclusion, it declined to consider the "policy or custom"
question. App. to Pet. for Cert. A37-A39.

The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. 710 F. 2d 240 (1983). It
reasoned that the killing of a fleeing suspect is a "seizure" under the
Fourth Amendment,[^24] and is therefore constitutional only if
"reasonable." The Tennessee statute failed as applied to this case
because it did not adequately limit the use of deadly force by
distinguishing between felonies of different magnitudes --- "the facts,
as found, did not justify the use of deadly force under the Fourth
Amendment." *Id.,* at 246. Officers cannot resort to deadly force unless
they "have probable cause \... to believe that the suspect \[has
committed a felony and\] poses a threat to the safety of the officers or
a danger to the community if left at large." *Ibid.*[^25]

The State of Tennessee, which had intervened to defend the statute, see
28 U. S. C. § 2403(b), appealed to this Court. The city filed a petition
for certiorari. We noted probable jurisdiction in the appeal and granted
the petition. 465 U. S. 1098 (1984).

II

Whenever an officer restrains the freedom of a person to walk away, he
has seized that person. *United States* v. *Brignoni-Ponce,* 422 U. S.
873, 878 (1975). While it is not always clear just when minimal police
interference becomes a seizure, see *United States* v. *Mendenhall,* 446
U. S. 544 (1980), there can be no question that apprehension by the use
of deadly force is a seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement
of the Fourth Amendment.

A

A police officer may arrest a person if he has probable cause to believe
that person committed a crime. *E. g., United States* v. *Watson,* 423
U. S. 411 (1976). Petitioners and appellant argue that if this
requirement is satisfied the Fourth Amendment has nothing to say about
*how* that seizure is made. This submission ignores the many cases in
which this Court, by balancing the extent of the intrusion against the
need for it, has examined the reasonableness of the manner in which a
search or seizure is conducted. To determine the constitutionality of a
seizure "\[w\]e must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on
the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of
the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion." *United
States* v. *Place,* 462 U. S. 696, 703 (1983); see *Delaware* v.
*Prouse,* 440 U. S. 648, 654 (1979); *United States* v.
*Martinez-Fuerte,* 428 U. S. 543, 555 (1976). We have described "the
balancing of competing interests" as "the key principle of the Fourth
Amendment." *Michigan* v. *Summers,* 452 U. S. 692, 700, n. 12 (1981).
See also *Camara* v. *Municipal Court,* 387 U. S. 523, 536-537 (1967).
Because one of the factors is the extent of the intrusion, it is plain
that reasonableness depends on not only when a seizure is made, but also
how it is carried out. *United States* v. *Ortiz,* 422 U. S. 891, 895
(1975); *Terry* v. *Ohio,* 392 U. S. 1, 28-29 (1968).

Applying these principles to particular facts, the Court has held that
governmental interests did not support a lengthy detention of luggage,
*United States* v. *Place, supra,* an airport seizure not "carefully
tailored to its underlying justification," *Florida* v. *Royer,* 460 U.
S. 491, 500 (1983) (plurality-opinion), surgery under general anesthesia
to obtain evidence, *Winston* v. *Lee,* 470 U. S. 753 (1985), or
detention for fingerprinting without probable cause, *Davis* v.
*Mississippi,* 394 U. S. 721 (1969); *Hayes* v. *Florida,* 470 U. S. 811
(1985). On the other hand, under the same approach it has upheld the
taking of fingernail scrapings from a suspect, *Cupp* v. *Murphy,* 412
U. S. 291 (1973), an unannounced entry into a home to prevent the
destruction of evidence, *Ker* v. *California,* 374 U. S. 23 (1963),
administrative housing inspections without probable cause to believe
that a code violation will be found, *Camara* v. *Municipal Court,
supra,* and a blood test of a drunken-driving suspect, *Schmerber* v.
*California, 384* U. S. 757 (1966). In each of these cases, the question
was whether the totality of the circumstances justified a particular
sort of search or seizure.

B

The same balancing process applied in the cases cited above demonstrates
that, notwithstanding probable cause to seize a suspect, an officer may
not always do so by killing him. The intrusiveness of a seizure by means
of deadly force is unmatched. The suspect's fundamental interest in his
own life need not be elaborated upon. The use of deadly force also
frustrates the interest of the individual, and of society, in judicial
determination of guilt and punishment. Against these interests are
ranged governmental interests in effective law enforcement.[^26] It is
argued that overall violence will be reduced by encouraging the peaceful
submission of suspects who know that they may be shot if they flee.
Effectiveness in making arrests requires the resort to deadly force, or
at least the meaningful threat thereof. "Being able to arrest such
individuals is a condition precedent to the state's entire system of law
enforcement." Brief for Petitioners 14.

Without in any way disparaging the importance of these goals, we are not
convinced that the use of deadly force is a sufficiently productive
means of accomplishing them to justify the killing of nonviolent
suspects. Cf. *Delaware* v. *Prouse, supra,* at 659. The use of deadly
force is a self-defeating way of apprehending a suspect and so setting
the criminal justice mechanism in motion. If successful, it guarantees
that that mechanism will not be set in motion. And while the meaningful
threat of deadly force might be thought to lead to the arrest of more
live suspects by discouraging escape attempts,[^27] the presently
available evidence does not support this thesis.[^28] The fact is that a
majority of police departments in this country have forbidden the use of
deadly force against nonviolent suspects. See *infra,* at 18-19. If
those charged with the enforcement of the criminal law have abjured the
use of deadly force in arresting nondangerous felons, there is a
substantial basis for doubting that the use of such force is an
essential attribute of the arrest power in all felony cases. See
*Schumann* v. *McGinn,* 307 Minn. 446, 472, 240 N. W. 2d 525, 540 (1976)
(Rogosheske, J., dissenting in part). Petitioners and appellant have not
persuaded us that shooting nondangerous fleeing suspects is so vital as
to outweigh the suspect's interest in his own life.

The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects,
whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable. It is not
better that all felony suspects die than that they escape. Where the
suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to
others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not
justify the use of deadly force to do so. It is no doubt unfortunate
when a suspect who is in sight escapes, but the fact that the police
arrive a little late or are a little slower afoot does not always
justify killing the suspect. A police officer may not seize an unarmed,
nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead. The Tennessee statute is
unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes the use of deadly force
against such fleeing suspects.

It is not, however, unconstitutional on its face. Where the officer has
probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious
physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not
constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.
Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is
probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the
infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly
force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if, where
feasible, some warning has been given. As applied in such circumstances,
the Tennessee statute would pass constitutional muster.

A

It is insisted that the Fourth Amendment must be construed in light of
the common-law rule, which allowed the use of whatever force was
necessary to effect the arrest of a fleeing felon, though not a
misdemeanant. As stated in Hale's posthumously published Pleas of the
Crown:

> "\[I\]f persons that are pursued by these officers for felony or the
> just suspicion thereof . . . shall not yield themselves to these
> officers, but shall either resist or fly before they are apprehended
> or being apprehended shall rescue themselves and resist or fly, so
> that they cannot be otherwise apprehended, and are upon necessity
> slain therein, because they cannot be otherwise taken, it is no
> felony." 2 M. Hale, Historia Placitorum Coronae 85 (1736).

See also 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries \*289. Most American
jurisdictions also imposed a flat prohibition against the use of deadly
force to stop a fleeing misdemeanant, coupled with a general privilege
*to* use such force to stop a fleeing felon. *E. g., Holloway* v.
*Moser,* 193 N. C. 185, 136 S. E. 375 (1927); *State* v. *Smith,* 127
Iowa 534, 535, 103 N. W. 944, 945 (1905); *Reneau* v. *State,* 70 Tenn.
720 (1879); *Brooks* v. *Commonwealth,* 61 Pa. 352 (1869); *Roberts* v.
*State,* 14 Mo. 138 (1851); see generally R. Perkins & R. Boyce,
Criminal Law 1098-1102 (3d ed. 1982); Day, Shooting the Fleeing Felon:
State of the Law, 14 Crim. L. Bull. 285, 286-287 (1978); Wilgus, Arrest
Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 798, 807-816 (1924). But see
*Storey* v. *State,* 71 Ala. 329 (1882); *State* v. *Bryant,* 65 N. C.
327, 328 (1871); *Caldwell* v. *State,* 41 Tex. 86 (1874).

The State and city argue that because this was the prevailing rule at
the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment and for some time
thereafter, and is still in force in some States, use of deadly force
against a fleeing felon must be "reasonable." It is true that this Court
has often looked to the common law in evaluating the reasonableness, for
Fourth Amendment purposes, of police activity. See, *e. g., United
States* v. *Watson,* 423 U. S. 411, 418-419 (1976); *Gerstein* v.
*Pugh,* 420 U. S. 103, 111, 114 (1975); *Carroll* v. *United States,*
267 U. S. 132, 149-153 (1925). On the other hand, it "has not simply
frozen into constitutional law those law enforcement practices that
existed at the time of the Fourth Amendment's passage." *Payton* v. *New
York,* 445 U. S. 573, 591, n. 33 (1980). Because of sweeping change in
the legal and technological context, reliance on the common-law rule in
this case would be a mistaken literalism that ignores the purposes of a
historical inquiry.

B

It has been pointed out many times that the common-law rule is best
understood in light of the fact that it arose at a time when virtually
all felonies were punishable by death.[^29] "Though effected without the
protections and formalities of an orderly trial and conviction, the
killing of a resisting or fleeing felon resulted in no greater
consequences than those authorized for punishment of the felony of which
the individual was charged or suspected." American Law Institute, Model
Penal Code §3.07, Comment 3, p. 56 (Tentative Draft No. 8, 1958)
(hereinafter Model Penal Code Comment). Courts have also justified the
common-law rule by emphasizing the relative dangerousness of felons.
See, *e. g., Schumann* v. *McGinn,* 307 Minn., at 458, 240 N. W. 2d, at
533; *Holloway* v. *Moser, supra,* at 187, 136 S. E., at 376 (1927).

Neither of these justifications makes sense today. Almost all crimes
formerly punishable by death no longer are or can be. See, *e. g.,
Enmund* v. *Florida,* 458 U. S. 782 (1982); *Coker* v. *Georgia,* 433 U.
S. 584 (1977). And while in earlier times "the gulf between the felonies
and the minor offences was broad and deep," 2 Pollock & Maitland 467, n.
3; *Carroll* v. *United States, supra,* at 158, today the distinction is
minor and often arbitrary. Many crimes classified as misdemeanors, or
nonexistent, at common law are now felonies. Wilgus, 22 Mich. L. Rev.,
at 572-573. These changes have undermined the concept, which was
questionable to begin with, that use of deadly force against a fleeing
felon is merely a speedier execution of someone who has already
forfeited his life. They have also made the assumption that a "felon" is
more dangerous than a misdemeanant untenable. Indeed, numerous
misdemeanors involve conduct more dangerous than many felonies.[^30]

There is an additional reason why the common-law rule cannot be directly
translated to the present day. The common-law rule developed at a time
when weapons were rudimentary. Deadly force could be inflicted almost
solely in a hand-to-hand struggle during which, necessarily, the safety
of the arresting officer was at risk. Handguns were not carried by
police officers until the latter half of the last century. L. Kennett &
J. Anderson, The Gun in America 150-151 (1975). Only then did it become
possible to use deadly force from a distance as a means of apprehension.
As a practical matter, the use of deadly force under the standard
articulation of the common-law rule has an altogether different meaning
--- and harsher consequences --- now than in past centuries. See
Wechsler & Michael, A Rationale for the Law of Homicide: I, 37 Colum. L.
Rev. 701, 741 (1937).[^31]

One other aspect of the common-law rule bears emphasis. It forbids the
use of deadly force to apprehend a misde-meanant, condemning such action
as disproportionately severe. See *Holloway* v. *Moser,* 193 N. C., at
187, 136 S. E., at 376; *State* v. *Smith,* 127 Iowa, at 535, 103 N. W.,
at 945. See generally Annot., 83 A. L. R. 3d 238 (1978).

In short, though the common-law pedigree of Tennessee's rule is pure on
its face, changes in the legal and technological context mean the rule
is distorted almost beyond recognition when literally applied.

C

In evaluating the reasonableness of police procedures under the Fourth
Amendment, we have also looked to prevailing rules in individual
jurisdictions. See, *e. g., United States* v. *Watson,* 423 U. S., at
421-422. The rules in the States are varied. See generally Comment, 18
Ga. L. Rev. 137, 140-144 (1983). Some 19 States have codified the
common-law rule,[^32] though in two of these the courts have
significantly limited the statute.[^33] Four States, though without a
relevant statute, apparently retain the common-law rule.[^34] Two States
have adopted the Model Penal Code's provision verbatim.[^35] Eighteen
others allow, in slightly varying language, the use of deadly force only
if the suspect has committed a felony involving the use or threat of
physical or deadly force, or is escaping with a deadly weapon, or is
likely to endanger life or inflict serious physical injury if not
arrested.[^36] Louisiana and Vermont, though without statutes or case
law on point, do forbid the use of deadly force to prevent any but
violent felonies.[^37] The remaining States either have no relevant
statute or case law, or have positions that are unclear.[^38]

It cannot be said that there is a constant or overwhelming trend away
from the common-law rule. In recent years, some States have reviewed
their laws and expressly rejected abandonment of the common-law
rule.[^39] Nonetheless, the long-term movement has been away from the
rule that deadly force may be used against any fleeing felon, and that
remains the rule in less than half the States.

This trend is more evident and impressive when viewed in light of the
policies adopted by the police departments themselves. Overwhelmingly,
these are more restrictive than the common-law rule. C. Milton, J.
Halleck, J. Lardner, & G. Abrecht, Police Use of Deadly Force 45-46
(1977). The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York City Police
Department, for example, both forbid the use of firearms except when
necessary to prevent death or grievous bodily harm. *Id.,* at 40-41;
App. 88. For accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Law
Enforcement Agencies, a department must restrict the use of deadly force
to situations where "the officer reasonably believes that the action is
in defense of human life \... or in defense of any person in immediate
danger of serious physical injury." Commission on Accreditation for Law
Enforcement Agencies, Inc., Standards for Law Enforcement Agencies 1-2
(1983) (italics deleted). A 1974 study reported that the police
department regulations in a majority of the large cities of the United
States allowed the firing of a weapon only when a felon presented a
threat of death or serious bodily harm. Boston Police Department,
Planning & Research Division, The Use of Deadly Force by Boston Police
Personnel (1974), cited in *Mattis* v. *Schnarr,* 547 F. 2d 1007, 1016,
n. 19 (CA8 1976), vacated as moot *sub nom. Ashcroft* v. Mattis, 431 U.
S. 171 (1977). Overall, only 7.5% of departmental and municipal policies
explicitly permit the use of deadly force against any felon; 86.8%
explicitly do not. K. Matulia, A Balance of Forces: A Report of the
International Association of Chiefs of Police 161 (1982) (table). See
also Record 1108-1368 (written policies of 44 departments). See
generally W. Geller & K. Karales, Split-Second Decisions 33-42 (1981);
Brief for Police Foundation et al. as *Amici Curiae.* In light of the
rules adopted by those who must actually administer them, the older and
fading common-law view is a dubious indicium of the constitutionality of
the Tennessee statute now before us.

D

Actual departmental policies are important for an additional reason. We
would hesitate to declare a police practice of long standing
"unreasonable" if doing so would severely hamper effective law
enforcement. But the indications are to the contrary. There has been no
suggestion that crime has worsened in any way in jurisdictions that have
adopted, by legislation or departmental policy, rules similar to that
announced today. *Amici* note that "\[a\]fter extensive research and
consideration, \[they\] have concluded that laws permitting police
officers to use deadly force to apprehend unarmed, non-violent fleeing
felony suspects actually do not protect citizens or law enforcement
officers, do not deter crime or alleviate problems caused by crime, and
do not improve the crime-fighting ability of law enforcement agencies."
*Id.,* at 11. The submission is that the obvious state interests in
apprehension are not sufficiently served to warrant the use of lethal
weapons against all fleeing felons. See *supra,* at 10-11, and n. 10.

Nor do we agree with petitioners and appellant that the rule we have
adopted requires the police to make impossible, split-second evaluations
of unknowable facts. See Brief for Petitioners 25; Brief for Appellant
11. We do not deny the practical difficulties of attempting to assess
the suspect's dangerousness. However, similarly difficult judgments must
be made by the police in equally uncertain circumstances. See, *e. g.,
Terry* v. *Ohio,* 392 U. S., at 20, 27. Nor is there any indication that
in States that allow the use of deadly force only against dangerous
suspects, see nn. 15, 17-19, *supra,* the standard has been difficult to
apply or has led to a rash of litigation involving inappropriate
second-guessing of police officers' split-second decisions. Moreover,
the highly technical felony/misdemeanor distinction is equally, if not
more, difficult to apply in the field. An officer is in no position to
know, for example, the precise value of property stolen, or whether the
crime was a first or second offense. Finally, as noted above, this claim
must be viewed with suspicion in light of the similar self-imposed
limitations of so many police departments.

IV

The District Court concluded that Hymon was justified in shooting Garner
because state law allows, and the Federal Constitution does not forbid,
the use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing felony
suspect if no alternative means of apprehension is available. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. A9-A11, A38. This conclusion made a determination of
Garner's apparent dangerousness unnecessary. The court did find,
however, that Garner appeared to be unarmed, though Hymon could not be
certain that was the case. *Id.,* at A4, A23. See also App. 41, 56;
Record 219. Restated in Fourth Amendment terms, this means Hymon had no
articu-lable basis to think Garner was armed.

In reversing, the Court of Appeals accepted the District Court's factual
conclusions and held that "the facts, as found, did not justify the use
of deadly force." 710 F. 2d, at 246. We agree. Officer Hymon could not
reasonably have believed that Garner --- young, slight, and unarmed ---
posed any threat. Indeed, Hymon never attempted to justify his actions
on any basis other than the need to prevent an escape. The District
Court stated in passing that "\[t\]he facts of this case did not
indicate to Officer Hymon that Garner was 'non-danger ous.' " App. to
Pet. for Cert. A34. This conclusion is not explained, and seems to be
based solely on the fact that Garner had broken into a house at night.
However, the fact that Garner was a suspected burglar could not, without
regard to the other circumstances, automatically justify the use of
deadly force. Hymon did not have probable cause to believe that Garner,
whom he correctly believed to be unarmed, posed any physical danger to
himself or others.

The dissent argues that the shooting was justified by the fact that
Officer Hymon had probable cause to believe that Garner had committed a
nighttime burglary. *Post,* at 29, 32. While we agree that burglary is a
serious crime, we cannot agree that it is so dangerous as automatically
to justify the use of deadly force. The FBI classifies burglary as a
"property" rather than a "violent" crime. See Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports, Crime in the United States 1
(1984).[^40] Although the armed burglar would present a different
situation, the fact that an unarmed suspect has broken into a dwelling
at night does not automatically mean he is physically dangerous. This
case demonstrates as much. See also *Solem* v. *Helm,* 463 U. S. 277,
296-297, and nn. 22-23 (1983). In fact, the available statistics
demonstrate that burglaries only rarely involve physical violence.
During the 10-year period from 1973-1982, only 3.8% of all burglaries
involved violent crime. Bureau of Justice Statistics, Household Burglary
4 (1985).[^41] See also T. Reppetto, Residential Crime 17, 105 (1974);
Conklin & Bittner, Burglary in a Suburb, 11 Criminology 208, 214 (1973).

V

We wish to make clear what our holding means in the context of this
case. The complaint has been dismissed as to all the individual
defendants. The State is a party only by virtue of 28 U. S. C. § 2403(b)
and is not subject to liability. The possible liability of the remaining
defendants --- the Police Department and the city of Memphis --- hinges
on *Monell* v. *New York City Dept. of Social Services,* 436 U. S. 658
(1978), and is left for remand. We hold that the statute is invalid
insofar as it purported to give Hymon the authority to act as he did. As
for the policy of the Police Department, the absence of any discussion
of this issue by the courts below, and the uncertain state of the
record, preclude any consideration of its validity.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

*So ordered.*

Justice O'Connor,

with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.

The Court today holds that the Fourth Amendment prohibits a police
officer from using deadly force as a last resort to apprehend a criminal
suspect who refuses to halt when fleeing the scene of a nighttime
burglary. This conclusion rests on the majority's balancing of the
interests of the suspect and the public interest in effective law
enforcement. *Ante,* at 8. Notwithstanding the venerable common-law rule
authorizing the use of deadly force if necessary to apprehend a fleeing
felon, and continued acceptance of this rule by nearly half the States,
*ante,* at 14, 16-17, the majority concludes that Tennessee's statute is
unconstitutional inasmuch as it allows the use of such force to
apprehend a burglary suspect who is not obviously armed or otherwise
dangerous. Although the circumstances of this case are unquestionably
tragic and unfortunate, our constitutional holdings must be sensitive
both to the history of the Fourth Amendment and to the general
implications of the Court's reasoning. By disregarding the serious and
dangerous nature of residential burglaries and the longstanding practice
of many States, the Court effectively creates a Fourth Amendment right
allowing a burglary suspect to flee unimpeded from a police officer who
has probable cause to arrest, who has ordered the suspect to halt, and
who has no means short of firing his weapon to prevent escape. I do not
believe that the Fourth Amendment supports such a right, and I
accordingly dissent.

I-H

The facts below warrant brief review because they highlight the
difficult, split-second decisions police officers must make in these
circumstances. Memphis Police Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright
responded to a late-night call that a burglary was in progress at a
private residence. When the officers arrived at the scene, the callér
said that "they" were breaking into the house next door. App. in No.
81-5605 (CA6), p. 207. The officers found the residence had been
forcibly entered through a window and saw lights on inside the house.
Officer Hymon testified that when he saw the broken window he realized
"that something was wrong inside," *id.,* at 656, but that he could not
determine whether anyone --- either a burglar or a member of the
household --- was within the residence. *Id.,* at 209. As Officer Hymon
walked behind the house, he heard a door slam. He saw Edward Eugene
Garner run away from the house through the dark and cluttered backyard.
Garner crouched next to a 6-foot-high fence. Officer Hymon thought
Garner was an adult and was unsure whether Garner was armed because
Hymon "had no idea what was in the hand \[that he could not see\] or
what he might have had on his person." *Id.,* at 658-659. In fact,
Garner was 15 years old and unarmed. Hymon also did not know whether
accomplices remained inside the house. *Id.,* at 657. The officer
identified himself as a police officer and ordered Garner to halt.
Garner paused briefly and then sprang to the top of the fence. Believing
that Garner would escape if he climbed over the fence, Hymon fired his
revolver and mortally wounded the suspected burglar.

Appellee-respondent, the deceased's father, filed a 42 U. S. C. § 1983
action in federal court against Hymon, the city of Memphis, and other
defendants, for asserted violations of Garner's constitutional rights.
The District Court for the Western District of Tennessee held that
Officer Hymon's actions were justified by a Tennessee statute that
authorizes a police officer to "use all the necessary means to effect
the arrest," if "after notice of the intention to arrest the defendant,
he either flee or forcibly resist." Tenn. Code Ann. §40-7-108 (1982). As
construed by the Tennessee courts, this statute allows the use of deadly
force only if a police officer has probable cause to believe that a
person has committed a felony, the officer warns the person that he
intends to arrest him, and the officer reasonably believes that no means
less than such force will prevent the escape. See, *e. g., Johnson* v.
*State,* 173 Tenn. 134, 114 S. W. 2d 819 (1938). The District Court held
that the Tennessee statute is constitutional and that Hymon's actions as
authorized by that statute did not violate Garner's constitutional
rights. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed on the
grounds that the Tennessee statute "authorizing the killing of an
unarmed, nonviolent fleeing felon by police in order to prevent escape"
violates the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. 710 F. 2d 240, 244 (1983).

The Court affirms on the ground that application of the Tennessee
statute to authorize Officer Hymon's use of deadly force constituted an
unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The precise
issue before the Court deserves emphasis, because both the decision
below and the majority obscure what must be decided in this case. The
issue is not the constitutional validity of the Tennessee statute on its
face or as applied to some hypothetical set of facts. Instead, the issue
is whether the use of deadly force by Officer Hymon under the
circumstances of this case violated Garner's constitutional rights.
Thus, the majority's assertion that a police officer who has probable
cause to seize a suspect "may not always do so by killing him," *ante,*
at 9, is unexceptionable but also of little relevance to the question
presented here. The same is true of the rhetorically stirring statement
that "\[t\]he use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony
suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable."
*Ante,* at 11. The question we must address is whether the Constitution
allows the use of such force to apprehend a suspect who resists arrest
by attempting to flee the scene of a nighttime burglary of a residence.

II

For purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, I agree with the Court that
Officer Hymon "seized" Garner by shooting him. Whether that seizure was
reasonable and therefore permitted by the Fourth Amendment requires a
careful balancing of the important public interest in crime prevention
and detection and the nature and quality of the intrusion upon
legitimate interests of the individual. *United States* v. *Place,* 462
U. S. 696, 703 (1983). In striking this balance here, it is crucial to
acknowledge that police use of deadly force to apprehend a fleeing
criminal suspect falls within the "rubric of police conduct . . .
necessarily \[involving\] swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot
observations of the officer on the beat." *Terry* v. *Ohio,* 392 U. S.
1, 20 (1968). The clarity of hindsight cannot provide the standard for
judging the reasonableness of police decisions made in uncertain and
often dangerous circumstances. Moreover, I am far more reluctant than is
the Court to conclude that the Fourth Amendment proscribes a police
practice that was accepted at the time of the adoption of the Bill of
Rights and has continued to receive the support of many state
legislatures. Although the Court has recognized that the requirements of
the Fourth Amendment must respond to the reality of social and
technological change, fidelity to the notion of constitutional--- as
opposed to purely judicial --- limits on governmental action requires us
to impose a heavy burden on those who claim that practices accepted when
the Fourth Amendment was adopted are now constitutionally impermissible.
See, *e. g., United States* v. *Watson,* 423 U. S. 411, 416-421 (1976);
*Carroll* v. *United States,* 267 U. S. 132, 149-153 (1925). Cf. *United
States* v. *Villamonte-Marquez,* 462 U. S. 579, 585 (1983) (noting
"impressive historical pedigree" of statute challenged under Fourth
Amendment).

The public interest involved in the use of deadly force as a last resort
to apprehend a fleeing burglary suspect relates primarily to the serious
nature of the crime. Household burglaries not only represent the illegal
entry into a person's home, but also "pos\[e\] real risk of serious harm
to others." *Solem* v. *Helm,* 463 U. S. 277, 315-316 (1983) (Burger, C.
J., dissenting). According to recent Department of Justice statistics,
"\[t\]hree-fifths of all rapes in the home, three-fifths of all home
robberies, and about a third of home aggravated and simple assaults are
committed by burglars." Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Household
Burglary 1 (January 1985). During the period 1973-1982, 2.8 million such
violent crimes were committed in the course of burglaries. *Ibid.*
Victims of a forcible intrusion into their home by a nighttime prowler
will find little consolation in the majority's confident assertion that
"burglaries only rarely involve physical violence." *Ante,* at 21.
Moreover, even if a particular burglary, when viewed in retrospect, does
not involve physical harm to others, the "harsh potentialities for
violence" inherent in the forced entry into a home preclude
characterization of the crime as "innocuous, inconsequential, minor, or
'nonviolent.'" *Solem* v. *Helm, supra,* at 316 (Burger, C. J.,
dissenting). See also Restatement of Torts §131, Comment *g* (1934)
(burglary is among felonies that normally cause or threaten death or
serious bodily harm); R. Perkins & R. Boyce, Criminal Law 1110 (3d ed.
1982) (burglary is dangerous felony that creates unreasonable risk of
great personal harm).

Because burglary is a serious and dangerous felony, the public interest
in the prevention and detection of the crime is of compelling
importance. Where a police officer has probable cause to arrest a
suspected burglar, the use of deadly force as a last resort might well
be the only means of apprehending the suspect. With respect to a
particular burglary, subsequent investigation simply cannot represent a
substitute for immediate apprehension of the criminal suspect at the
scene. See President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration
of Justice, Task Force Report: The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society
97 (1967). Indeed, the Captain of the Memphis Police Department
testified that in his city, if apprehension is not immediate, it is
likely that the suspect will not be caught. App. in No. 81-5605 (CA6),
p. 334. Although some law enforcement agencies may choose to assume the
risk that a criminal will remain at large, the Tennessee statute
reflects a legislative determination that the use of deadly force in
prescribed circumstances will serve generally to protect the public.
Such statutes assist the police in apprehending suspected perpetrators
of serious crimes and provide notice that a lawful police order to stop
and submit to arrest may not be ignored with impunity. See, *e. g.,
Wiley* v. *Memphis Police Department,* 548 F. 2d 1247, 1252-1253 (CA6),
cert. denied, 434 U. S. 822 (1977); *Jones* v. *Marshall,* 528 F. 2d
132, 142 (CA2 1975).

The Court unconvincingly dismisses the general deterrence effects by
stating that "the presently available evidence does not support \[the\]
thesis" that the threat of force discourages escape and that "there is a
substantial basis for doubting that the use of such force is an
essential attribute to the arrest power in all felony cases." *Ante,* at
10, 11. There is no question that the effectiveness of police use of
deadly force is arguable and that many States or individual police
departments have decided not to authorize it in circumstances similar to
those presented here. But it should go without saying that the
effectiveness or popularity of a particular police practice does not
determine its constitutionality. Cf. *Spaziano* v. *Florida,* 468 U. S.
447, 464 (1984) ("The Eighth Amendment is not violated every time a
State reaches a conclusion different from a majority of its sisters over
how best to administer its criminal laws"). Moreover, the fact that
police conduct pursuant to a state statute is challenged on
constitutional grounds does not impose a burden on the State to produce
social science statistics or to dispel any possible doubts about the
necessity of the conduct. This observation, I believe, has particular
force where the challenged practice both predates enactment of the Bill
of Rights and continues to be accepted by a substantial number of the
States.

Against the strong public interests justifying the conduct at issue here
must be weighed the individual interests implicated in the use of deadly
force by police officers. The majority declares that "\[t\]he suspect's
fundamental interest in his own life need not be elaborated upon."
*Ante,* at 9. This blithe assertion hardly provides an adequate
substitute for the majority's failure to acknowledge the distinctive
manner in which the suspect's interest in his life is even exposed to
risk. For purposes of this case, we must recall that the police officer,
in the course of investigating a nighttime burglary, had reasonable
cause to arrest the suspect and ordered him to halt. The officer's use
of force resulted because the suspected burglar refused to heed this
command and the officer reasonably believed that there was no means
short of firing his weapon to apprehend the suspect. Without questioning
the importance of a person's interest in his life, I do not think this
interest encompasses a right to flee unimpeded from the scene of a
burglary. Cf. *Payton* v. *New York,* 445 U. S. 573, 617, n. 14 (1980)
(White, J., dissenting) ("\[T\]he policeman's hands should not be tied
merely because of the possibility that the suspect will fail to
cooperate with legitimate actions by law enforcement personnel"). The
legitimate interests of the suspect in these circumstances are
adequately accommodated by the Tennessee statute: to avoid the use of
deadly force and the consequent risk to his life, the suspect need
merely obey the valid order to halt.

A proper balancing of the interests involved suggests that use of deadly
force as a last resort to apprehend a criminal suspect fleeing from the
scene of a nighttime burglary is not unreasonable within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. Admittedly, the events giving rise to this case
are in retrospect deeply regrettable. No one can view the death of an
unarmed and apparently nonviolent 15-year-old without sorrow, much less
disapproval. Nonetheless, the reasonableness of Officer Hymon's conduct
for purposes of the Fourth Amendment cannot be evaluated by what later
appears to have been a preferable course of police action. The officer
pursued a suspect in the darkened backyard of a house that from all
indications had just been burglarized. The police officer was not
certain whether the suspect was alone or unarmed; nor did he know what
had transpired inside the house. He ordered the suspect to halt, and
when the suspect refused to obey and attempted to flee into the night,
the officer fired his weapon to prevent escape. The reasonableness of
this action for purposes of the Fourth Amendment is not determined by
the unfortunate nature of this particular case; instead, the question is
whether it is constitutionally impermissible for police officers, as a
last resort, to shoot a burglary suspect fleeing the scene of the crime.

Because I reject the Fourth Amendment reasoning of the majority and the
Court of Appeals, I briefly note that no other constitutional provision
supports the decision below. In addition to his Fourth Amendment claim,
appellee-respondent also alleged violations of due process, the Sixth
Amendment right to trial by jury, and the Eighth Amendment proscription
of cruel and unusual punishment. These arguments were rejected by the
District Court and, except for the due process claim, not addressed by
the Court of Appeals. With respect to due process, the Court of Appeals
reasoned that statutes affecting the fundamental interest in life must
be "narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at
stake." 710 F. 2d, at 245. The Court of Appeals concluded that a statute
allowing police use of deadly force is narrowly drawn and therefore
constitutional only if the use of such force is limited to situations in
which the suspect poses an immediate threat to others. Id., at 246-247.
Whatever the validity of Tennessee's statute in other contexts, I cannot
agree that its application in this case resulted in a deprivation
"without due process of law." Cf. *Baker* v. *McCollan,* 443 U. S. 137,
144-145 (1979). Nor do I believe that a criminal suspect who is shot
while trying to avoid apprehension has a cognizable claim of a
deprivation of his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. See
*Cunningham* v. *Ellington,* 323 F. Supp. 1072, 1075-1076 (WD Tenn.
1971) (three-judge court). Finally, because there is no indication that
the use of deadly force was intended to punish rather than to capture
the suspect, there is no valid claim under the Eighth Amendment. See
*Bell* v. *Wolfish,* 441 U. S. 520, 538-539 (1979). Accordingly, I
conclude that the District Court properly entered judgment against
appellee-respondent, and I would reverse the decision of the Court of
Appeals.

III

Even if I agreed that the Fourth Amendment was violated under the
circumstances of this case, I would be unable to join the Court's
opinion. The Court holds that deadly force may be used only if the
suspect "threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause
to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or
threatened infliction of serious physical harm." *Ante,* at 11. The
Court ignores the more general implications of its reasoning. Relying on
the Fourth Amendment, the majority asserts that it is constitutionally
unreasonable to *use* deadly force against fleeing criminal suspects who
do not appear to pose a threat of serious physical harm to others.
*Ibid.* By declining to limit its holding to the use of firearms, the
Court unnecessarily implies that the Fourth Amendment constrains the use
of any police practice that is potentially lethal, no matter how remote
the risk. Cf. *Los Angeles* v. *Lyons,* 461 U. S. 95 (1983).

Although it is unclear from the language of the opinion, I assume that
the majority intends the word "use" to include only those circumstances
in which the suspect is actually apprehended. Absent apprehension of the
suspect, there is no "seizure" for Fourth Amendment purposes. I doubt
that the Court intends to allow criminal suspects who successfully
escape to return later with §1983 claims against officers who used,
albeit unsuccessfully, deadly force in their futile attempt to capture
the fleeing suspect. The Court's opinion, despite its broad language,
actually decides only that the shooting of a fleeing burglary suspect
who was in fact neither armed nor dangerous can support a § 1983 action.

The Court's silence on critical factors in the decision to use deadly
force simply invites second-guessing of difficult police decisions that
must be made quickly in the most trying of circumstances. Cf. *Payton*
v. *New York,* 445 U. S., at 619 (White, J., dissenting). Police are
given no guidance for determining which objects, among an array of
potentially lethal weapons ranging from guns to knives to baseball bats
to rope, will justify the use of deadly force. The Court also declines
to outline the additional factors necessary to provide "probable cause"
for believing that a suspect "poses a significant threat of death or
serious physical injury," *ante,* at 3, when the officer has probable
cause to arrest and the suspect refuses to obey an order to halt. But
even if it were appropriate in this case to limit the use of deadly
force to that ambiguous class of suspects, I believe the class should
include nighttime residential burglars who resist arrest by attempting
to flee the scene of the crime. We can expect an escalating volume of
litigation as the lower courts struggle to determine if a police
officer's split-second decision to shoot was justified by the danger
posed by a particular object and other facts related to the crime. Thus,
the majority opinion portends a burgeoning area of Fourth Amendment
doctrine concerning the circumstances in which police officers can
reasonably employ deadly force.

IV

The Court's opinion sweeps broadly to adopt an entirely new standard for
the constitutionality of the use of deadly force to apprehend fleeing
felons. Thus, the Court "lightly brushe\[s\] aside," *Payton* v. *New
York, supra,* at 600, a longstanding police practice that predates the
Fourth Amendment and continues to receive the approval of nearly half of
the state legislatures. I cannot accept the majority's creation of a
constitutional right to flight for burglary suspects seeking to avoid
capture at the scene of the crime. Whatever the constitutional limits on
police use of deadly force in order to apprehend a fleeing felon, I do
not believe they are exceeded in a case in which a police officer has
probable cause to arrest a suspect at the scene of a residential
burglary, orders the suspect to halt, and then fires his weapon as a
last resort to prevent the suspect's escape into the night. I
respectfully dissent.

ALPERT, Judge.

One fundamental exception to the duress defense lies at the center of
this appeal. Marvin Larvae Williams, appellant, was charged with
attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, daytime housebreaking, and the
use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Williams
waived his right to a jury trial and a court trial commenced in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Kahl, J.) on February 23, 1993, at
the close of which, the trial judge requested memoranda concerning the
defense of duress. The case was resumed on May 4, 1993, at which time
Williams was convicted of the charged offenses. He was sentenced to
eight years imprisonment for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon,
eight years for daytime housebreaking, and five years imprisonment,
without possibility of parole, for the use of a handgun in the
commission of a crime of violence. All sentences were to run
concurrently. Appellant noted a timely appeal and asks two questions:

> 1\. Was the trial court clearly erroneous in convicting Appellant of
> the offenses with which he was charged?
>
> 2\. Should the docket entries be amended to correctly reflect
> Appellant's convictions?[^42]

FACTS

The victim, the Reverend Chris Glenn Hale, lived at 8601 Gray Fox Road,
Apartment 102 in Randallstown, Maryland at the time of the incident. On
March 1, 1990 at or about 4:45 p.m., Hale heard a knock on his apartment
door. He went to the door, looked through the keyhole, and saw Williams
standing at the door. Hale asked who was there and Williams answered by
mumbling, asking if a certain person resided at Hale's residence. Hale
could not understand Williams so he partially opened the door, whereupon
four men, including Williams, rushed through. One of the men, not
Williams, proceeded to hold a gun to Hale's face. Hale noticed that
three of the men were armed, but did not see if Williams was armed.

After the men entered Hale's apartment, they spread out around the
apartment to search for other persons, and the apparent leader demanded
that Hale divulge the location of "the money" and "the dope." Williams,
in the meantime, kept telling the men that the "dope" was in Hale's
apartment, that he and Hale were friends, and that he had been in the
apartment the previous day where he had used the "dope" with Hale. After
searching unsuccessfully for the "dope," Williams was forced to kneel
next to Hale, and the three men made more demands of the both of them as
to where the money and the dope were located. The men then allowed
Williams to get up from the floor to make a telephone call. Williams
spoke on the phone for about ten minutes, and when he got off the phone,
he walked out of the bedroom with two of the men (including the leader),
where they talked for about five minutes. Hale was then tied up and the
men, including Williams, left shortly. Nothing was taken from Hale's
apartment.

At the trial, Williams testified that he was abducted by the three men
because they believed that he knew the whereabouts of the drug stash of
one Chuckie Eubanks, a reputed drug dealer. Williams had borrowed money
from Chuckie's brother, Rodney, and had been induced to make a drug run
to New York in order to help repay his debt. The Eubanks organization
required Williams to make a second trip to New York,, during which
Williams cooperated with the police and obtained the names, phone
numbers, addresses, and license tag numbers of the parties involved in
the drug deal. Apparently, the three abductors, who were former members
of Eubanks's drug organization, knew of Williams's relationship with
Eubanks and believed that he would know the location of the stash house.
When Williams was abducted by the men, he told them that he did not know
the location of the stash house. The men did not believe Williams and
threatened to kill him if he did not disclose its location. Williams led
the men to Hale's apartment, told them it was the stash house, and
knocked on the door. Once inside Hale's apartment, Williams testified
that he pretended to participate in the search of the premises. Williams
also said that the phone call he made was to his mother and was done at
the request of one of the abductors who instructed him to say that
"everything was all right," the abductors being concerned because
Williams's sister had witnessed the abduction.

Duress

Williams asserts that the trial court erred because its decision was
"predicated upon Appellant having engaged in criminal conduct in which
he was not specifically directed to engage. Because of this, the trial
court never even focused upon the question it actually had to resolve:
whether any legal alternative existed for Appellant to the conduct in
which he engaged." In the instant case, the trial court heard the
testimony of all the witnesses and concluded that

> \[t\]he \[Appellant\] wants you to believe that he was victimized,
> that he was taken off the street, and by point of gun, forced to
> commit an armed robbery. That simply is not true. No one forced him to
> commit an armed robbery. No one forced him to go to the Reverend's
> house and demand money. The only thing these three persons wanted was
> to have the debt repaid, and they didn't care how it was done. The
> \[Appellant\] said, I don't care how I repay the debt, I just want to
> save my own soul, and I will commit an armed robbery to do it, and I
> will assist in the commission of an armed robbery if that satisfies
> the debt, if that appeases you and I am safe.

The court went on to find that the testimony taken as a whole did "lend
\[ \] some corroboration to \[Appellant's\] suggestion that, at least to
some degree, \[Appellant\] was under duress." The court however, did
qualify its finding by noting that the duress was not "to go to the
stash house" but rather "duress to pay the debt."[^43] Accordingly, the
court aptly focused on a very narrow issue: "whether the fact that
\[appellant\] was under duress to repay the debt, and thereby created
the scenario for this offense, operates as a complete defense to the
offense." The court requested additional memoranda on this issue and
concluded that facts of this case did not support a finding of duress.
Accordingly, we are faced with the question of whether a defendant's
contributory actions can act as a bar to the availability of the defense
of duress, *ie.,* whether the appellant's conduct presents an exception
to the applicability of the duress defense. We conclude that it does and
explain.

Chief Judge Orth, speaking for this court nearly a quarter of a century
ago, explained that

> \[i\]n order to constitute a defense, the duress by another person on
> the defendant must be present, imminent, and impending, and of such a
> nature as to induce well grounded apprehension of death or serious
> bodily injury if the act is not done. It must be of such a character
> as to leave no opportunity to the accused for escape. Mere fear or
> threat by another is not sufficient nor is a threat of violence at
> some prior time. The defense cannot be raised if the apprehended harm
> is only that of property damage or future but not present personal
> injury.

other state and federal jurisdictions.

*A. State Cases---Recent Cases*

In *Commonwealth v. Knight,* 416 Pa.Super. 586, 611 A.2d 1199 (1992),
the appellant, Terrence Knight, attempted to rob a bar at gunpoint. When
the owner of the bar pulled a gun, Knight said that there were other men
outside, and ran out the door. Knight was later picked up by police and
identified by the bar owner as the man who tried to rob the bar. *Id.*
611 A.2d at 1201. At trial, Knight relied upon the defense of duress. He
asserted that he was forced to rob the bar by two men from whom he
bought \$60 worth of drugs earlier that day. Knight claimed that the
drug dealers, armed with a knife and a baseball bat, found him at his
girlfriend's house, and forced him under the threat of death to go to
the bar and rob it. *Id.* 611 A.2d at 1201.

The court, citing 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. § 309(b),[^44] which was adopted
from the Model Penal Code, stated that the duress defense is unavailable
if the actor *"recklessly* placed himself in a situation in which it was
probable that he would be subjected to duress," or if the actor was
"negligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence
suffices to establish culpability to the offense charged." *Id.* 611
A.2d at 1203. Knight argued that the term "recklessly" in subsection (b)
could not be easily comprehended by a lay person without legal
assistance. *Id.* The court held that the term "recklessly" should be
defined for a jury and that a definition of the term is "efficacious
when considering the language and purpose behind the exception to the
duress defense." *Id.* The court referred to the definitional section of
the Pennsylvania Criminal Code, 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. § 103, which in
turn referred to § 302 of the Code. Section 302 defined "recklessly" as
follows:

> A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an
> offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustified
> risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.
> The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the
> nature and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known
> to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of
> conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's
> situation.

*Id.* 611 A.2d at 1204. (quoting 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. § 302(b)(3)).

The court, therefore, concluded that § 302 provides the normal meaning
of "recklessly" throughout the statute encompassing both the defense of
duress as well as the elements of an offense. *Id.* 611 A.2dvat 1204. In
so doing, the court agreed with Knight's argument that "recklessly" and
"negligence" did not have the same meaning within the context of the
Criminal Code. *Id.* 611 A.2d at 1205. The court then went on to state
that "recklessly" denotes more culpability than negligence:

> there should be no exculpation if the actor recklessly placed himself
> in the situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected
> to duress. Though this provision may have the effect of sanctioning
> conviction of a crime of purpose when the actor's culpability was
> limited to recklessness, we think the substitution is permissible in
> view of the exceptional nature of the offense. The provision will have
> its main room for operation in the case of persons who connect
> themselves with criminal activities, in which case too fine a line
> need not be drawn. *When there is no more than negligence, however, on
> the actor's part in placing himself in a situation where duress was
> probable \... \[tjhe defense is excluded only on a charge which
> negligence suffices to establish culpability \... \[t\]he difference
> between* *inadvertence and conscious risk creation involved in
> recklessness appears to justify discriminating in this way.*

*Id.* 611 A.2d at 1205 (emphasis in the original) (quoting Model Penal
Code, Comments, Tentative Draft 10, at 8). The court held that the
defendant, however, was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to
define the term "recklessly," and affirmed his conviction.

The Court of Appeals of Alaska in *Walker v. State,* 674 P.2d 825
(Alaska Ct.App.1983), held that the trial court's failure to define the
term "recklessly" was not plain error. *Id.* at 830. Walker, the
defendant, and his cohorts knocked on the door of a residence they
planned to burglarize to make sure no one was home. *Id.* at 827. When
the owner's son opened the door, the three men claimed they had car
trouble and were in need of a telephone. *Id.* at 827. The men entered
the dwelling, robbed it and later kidnapped and killed the owner and her
son. *Id.* at 827. At trial, Walker claimed that he agreed to
participate in the burglary, but from the moment his companions drew a
gun, he had to go along with the other greater crimes out of fear for
his well-being. Walker was tried for two counts of first-degree murder,
two counts of kidnapping, one count of robbery, one count of burglary,
and two counts of theft. Walker was convicted on all counts except the
murder counts. *Id.* at 827. On appeal, the court concluded that under
Alaska Stat. § 11.81.440(b),[^45] duress is an affirmative defense and
therefore the burden was on Walker to establish this defense. As he
never objected to the instructions, the Court held that the trial
court's failure to define the term "recklessly" did not constitute plain
error. *Id.* at 827-29.

In *Meador v. State,* 10 Ark.App. 325, 664 S.W.2d 878 (1984), Meador was
charged with attempted robbery. Testimony at trial revealed that Meador
tried to rob a nursing home after some men to whom he owed money picked
him up at his apartment and said they were going to use him to rob an
establishment to collect their money. *Id.* 664 S.W.2d at 880. Meador
therefore objected to the trial court's instructions that duress is not
a defense if he "recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it
was reasonably forseeable that he would be subjected to the force or
threatened force." *Id.* 664 S.W.2d at 881. The Arkansas Court of
Appeals found no error in the trial court's jury instruction, concluding
that from

> the evidence adduced at trial, particularly the testimony of the
> appellant concerning why he owed the debt to the men who allegedly
> forced him to rob the nursing home, it could be inferred that the
> appellant's drug dependence placed him in the position to be forced by
> these men to do something he might otherwise not do. Thus the trial
> court's instructions that the appellant could not claim the defense if
> he recklessly put himself in that position was proper under the
> circumstances of the case.

*Id.* 664 S.W.2d at 881.

The Washington State Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in
*State v. McKinney,* 19 Wash.App. 23, 573 P.2d 820 (1978). There the
defendant, McKinney, was convicted of robbery in the first degree while
armed with a firearm. Apparently, McKinney and a companion, both of whom
were escapees from a prison work release program, robbed a tavern where
they had been drinking for several hours. *Id.* 573 P.2d at 820. As his
companion pointed a gun at the bartender, McKinney emptied out the cash
drawer. McKinney testified at trial that he was "coerced into taking the
money from the till and that, had he not cooperated with his companion,
either \[McKinney\] or the bartender might have been shot." *Id.* 573
P.2d at 821. In dismissing the duress defense, the court cited
Wash.Rev.Code § 9A.16.060, which defines the elements of the duress
defense. *Id.* Specifically, the court noted subsection (3), which
provides that "\[t\]he defense of duress is not available if the actor
intentionally or recklessly places himself in a situation in which it is
probable that he will be subject to duress." *Id. 573* P.2d at 821.
Finding nothing on the record to suggest that McKinney "acted under any
personal constraint or that he was threatened," the court held that the
trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury as to this
affirmative defense. *Id.*

In *People v. Rodriquez,* 30 Ill.App.3d 118, 332 N.E.2d 194 (1975), the
defendant, Rodriquez, was granted a three day furlough from jail and did
not return, claiming that he was in fear of retribution from one of the
corrections officers. *Id.* 332 N.E.2d at 196. Apparently, the officer
had given Rodriquez money to buy a pound of marijuana while out on
furlough, which Rodriquez subsequently spent while celebrating. *Id.*
332 N.E.2d at 196. The court held that the defense of compulsion, as
defined by Ill.Rev.Stat. Ch. 38, sec. 7-ll(a) (1973),[^46] was not
applicable. *Id.* 332 N.E.2d at 196. The court further noted that, even
assuming the presence of the alleged threat, Rodriquez's assertion of
compulsion fails because

> if \[the compulsion\] actually existed, \[it\] arose only from the
> defendant's appropriation for his own use of the funds given to him by
> the prison officer. Had the defendant returned the money instead of
> squandering it or had he completed the illegal scheme as planned, no
> compulsion would have arisen. Thus the compulsion resulted from the
> defendant's own negligence or fault, and the statutory defense is
> therefore inapplicable.

*Id.*

A similar result was reached by the Colorado Court of Appeals in *People
v. Bailey,* 41 Colo.App. 385, 590 P.2d 508 (1978). There the defendants
were convicted of the sale of narcotics, dispensing dangerous drugs, and
conspiracy to sell narcotic drugs. *Id.* 590 P.2d at 509. The defendants
claimed that the conduct of undercover CBI (Colorado Bureau of
Investigation) agents, who posed as mafia gangsters and talked of
eliminating "snitches," constituted duress. *Id.* 590 P.2d at 510. The
court, citing Section 18-1-708 of the Colorado code (C.R.S.1973),[^47]
held that the facts did not support a finding of duress. The court
further noted that, in any case, the duress defense was not available
because "defendants intentionally or recklessly placed themselves in a
situation in which it was foreseeable that they might be subjected to
force or threatened use of force." *Id.* 590 P.2d at 510. *See also
State v. Kinslow,* 165 Ariz. 503, 799 P.2d 844, 848 (1990) (noting that
the duress defense was not available to a prison escapee because under
Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. § 13-412(B) the duress defense is unavailable "if the
person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placed himself in a
situation which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress."

*B. Federal Cases*

In *U.S. v. Liu,* 960 F.2d 449 (5th Cir.1992), Liu, a government
informant on illegal activity in the Houston, Texas, Asian community,
was arrested for his involvement in a green card scam during a sting
operation. *Id.* at 451. At trial, Liu claimed that he was acting out of
fear of suffering injury or death at the hands of one of the police
officers who initiated the sting operation. *Id.* at 452. The trial
court, however, denied the instruction Liu submitted on the affirmative
defense of duress. *Id.* at 453. Affirming, the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit held that the requested instruction did not conform to
Fifth Circuit requirements for a successful duress defense and that even
if the instruction was consistent with Fifth Circuit requirements, he
was not entitled to the defense. *Id.* at 454-55. The Court explained
that pursuant to *United States v. Harvey,* 897 F.2d 1300, 1304-05 (5th
Cir. 1990), the defendant must show

> \(1\) that defendant was under an unlawful and 'present, imminent, and
> impending (threat) of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded
> apprehension of death or serious bodily injury.'; (2) that defendant
> had not 'recklessly or negligently placed himself in a situation in
> which it was probable that he would be (forced to choose the criminal
> conduct)'; (3) that defendant had no 'reasonable legal alternative to
> violating the law; a chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and
> also to avoid the threatened harm', and (4) 'that a direct causal
> relationship may be reasonably anticipated between the (criminal)
> action taken and the avoidance of (threatened) harm.'

The court also cited *U.S. v. Michelson,* 559 F.2d 567, 569 (9th
Cir.1977); *U.S. v. Lee, 694* F.2d 649, 654 (11th Cir.1983), *cert.
denied,* 460 U.S. 1086, 103 S.Ct. 1779, 76 L.Ed.2d 350 (1983); *U.S. v.

850, 103 S.Ct. 112, 74 L.Ed.2d 99 (1982) for the proposition that other
circuits describe the defense in nearly the same manner. *Liu,* 960 F.2d
at 453. *See also United States v. Gant,* 691 F.2d 1159, 1162-63 (5th
Cir.1982); *United States v. Wheeler,* 800 F.2d 100, 107 (7th Cir.1986);
*United States v. Blanco,* 754 F.2d 940, 943 (11th Cir.1985) (stating
that "\[a\] claim of duress \... \[is not applicable\] when a defendant
has recklessly or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it
was probable that he would be subject to duress"); *United States v.
Agard,* 605 F.2d 665, 667 (2nd Cir.1979) (noting that a claim of duress
"will not constitute a valid legal excuse when the defendant has
recklessly or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it was
probable that he would be subject to duress.") (citing the Model Penal
Code, § 2.09(2) (Ten. Draft No. I960)).

*C. State Cases---Older Cases*

It is clear that the above-mentioned state cases rely heavily on a
particular statute in that jurisdiction. The Maryland General Assembly,
however, has not enacted any such statute. Accordingly, we now examine
cases that do not rely on a statutorily enacted duress defense.
Specifically, we focus on whether the rule that disqualifies a defendant
from raising the defense of duress if the actor recklessly or
negligently placed herself in the situation from which it arose has been
recognized in instances where the particular jurisdiction had not
statutorily enacted the duress defense.

In *People v. Merhige,* 212 Mich. 601, 180 N.W. 418 (1920), three bank
robbers had defendant Merhige, a public taxi driver, drive them to and
from the bank they robbed. At trial, Merhige pled guilty and was
convicted of bank robbery. On appeal, Merhige stated that the robbers
were total strangers and that he was not aware of their intentions to
rob a bank. He further asserted that throughout the robbery, he was
afraid for his life and that the robbers forced him to acquiesce to
their demands. In reversing Merhige's conviction the Supreme Court of
Michigan cited the definition of the duress defense found in 16 Corpus
Juris at 91:

> An act which would otherwise constitute a crime may also be excused on
> the grounds that it was done under compulsion or duress. The
> compulsion which will excuse a criminal act, however, must be present,
> imminent, and impending, and of such a nature as to induce a
> well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act
> is not done. A threat of future injury is not enough. Such compulsion
> must have arisen without the negligence or fault of the person who
> insists upon it as a defense.

*Id.* 180 N.W. at 422. (emphasis added). In *People v. Kelly,* 51
Mich.App. 28, 214 N.W.2d 334, 335 (1974) the Court of Appeals of
Michigan relied on *Merhige* as the "correct rule." In that case, the
defendant, Kelly, was charged with armed robbery and found guilty by the
trial court. *Id.* 214 N.W.2d at 335. On appeal, Kelly alleged that the
trial judge's instructions on the duress defense,[^48] taken directly
from *Merhige,* constituted prejudicial error. *Id.* 214 N.W.2d at 335.
Concluding that *Merhige* "still is good law," the Court of Appeals of
Michigan affirmed. *Id.* 214 N.W.2d at 335.

In *State v. Patterson,* 117 Or. 153, 241 P. 977 (1925), the defendant
was convicted of larceny by embezzlement. On appeal, the defendant
contended that the trial court committed reversible error when it
instructed the jury that no evidence existed to support the defense of
duress. The Supreme Court of Oregon, citing 16 C.J. 91, affirmed the
defendant's conviction noting that the embezzlement "had its origin in
the defendant's own voluntary shortcoming. He himself was the
controlling and indispensable factor in the matter. He himself began the
digression from the path of rectitude. Without his act, the situation
which he claims was compulsory would not have occurred." *Id.* 241 P. at
978. *See also, State v. Clay,* 220 Iowa 1191, 264 N.W. 77, 83 (1935);
*Ross v. State,* 169 Ind. 388, 82 N.E. 781 (1907).

In addition to the case law mentioned above, we also note that the Model
Penal Code § 2.09 defines duress as follows:

> \(1\) It is an affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the
> conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do
> so by the use of, or threat to use, unlawful force against his person
> or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his
> situation would have been unable to resist.
>
> \(2\) The defense provided by this Section is unavailable if the actor
> recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that
> he would be subjected to duress. The defense is also unavailable if he
> was negligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever
> negligence suffices to establish culpability for the offense charged.

Model Penal Code § 2.09 (10 U.L.A.) (1974 & Supp.1994). The Comments to
Tentative Draft No. 10 indicate that the drafters recognized that
"\[i\]n the absence of governing legislation, the case law generally
recognizes the defense but imposes limitations on its scope similar to
those articulated in the statutes." (footnote omitted) ALI, Model Penal
Code § 2.09 (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960). The drafters then
specifically noted that

> \[sjubsection (2) accepts the view that there should be no exculpation
> if the actor recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was
> probable that he would be subjected to duress. Though this provision
> may have the effect of sanctioning conviction of a crime of purpose
> when the actor's culpability was limited to recklessness, we think the
> substitution is permissible in view of the exceptional nature of the
> defense. The provision will have its main room for operation in the
> case of persons who connect themselves with criminal activities, in
> which case too fine a line need not be drawn.

*Id.* at 8. Additionally, the Explanatory Note to the Duress section of
the Model Penal Code and Commentaries indicate that

> \[sjubsection (2) deprives the actor of his defense if he recklessly
> placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would
> be subjected to duress. Thus, an actor reckless in this respect can be
> liable for offenses that carry a higher culpability standard than
> recklessness.

ALI, *Model Penal Code and Commentaries,* § 2.09 at 367 (1985). In 1
*Wharton's Criminal Law* § 52 (C.E. Torcía, 15th ed. 1993), the author
notes that "\[t\]he defense of duress is not available if the defendant
intentionally or recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it
was reasonably foreseeable that he would be subjected to coercion."
(footnote omitted). *See also* 1 Wayne R. LaFave and Austin W. Scott,
Jr., *Substantive Criminal Law* § 5.3 (1986) (noting that "\[t\]he
defense of duress \... is a common law defense, applicable in
appropriate cases although no statute makes it so."); 22 CJS *Criminal
Law* § 52 (1989 & Supp.1994).

The reasoning of these cases and other authorities is persuasive and
correctly states the law applicable in instances where the actor's
contributory actions bar the availability of the defense of duress.
These authorities make it clear that the defense of duress is founded in
the common law and, as stated by the drafters of the Model Penal Code,
does not provide "exculpation if the actor recklessly placed himself in
a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to
duress." ALI, Model Penal Code § 2.09 (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960).
Additionally, we note that many of the statutes enacting the defense of
duress substantially adopt the Model Penal Code definition of duress.
*See e.g., Knight,* 611 A.2d at 1202-03 (quoting 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. §
309(b)); *Walker,* 674 P.2d at 827 (quoting Alaska Stat. §
11.81.440(b)). As noted previously, the Maryland General Assembly has
not codified the defense of duress. Based upon the authorities cited
above, we hold that where an actor recklessly (as defined in § 2.02 of
the Model Penal Code) places himself or herself in a situation where it
is probable that he or she would be subjected to duress, the defense of
duress is unavailable. In so holding we are particularly mindful of the
Model Penal Code drafters' reasoning that

> though this provision may have the effect of sanctioning conviction of
> a crime of purpose when the actor's culpability was limited to
> recklessness, we think the substitution is permissible in view of the
> exceptional nature of the defense. The provision will have its main
> room for operation in the case of persons who connect themselves with
> criminal activities, in which case too fine a line need not be drawn.

Because Williams's prior conduct contributed mightily to the predicament
in which he later found himself, the trial court did not err in
concluding that the defense of duress was inapplicable to the instant
case. Here, the evidence reveals that Williams voluntarily became
involved with the Eubanks' drug organization. It is unrefuted that
Williams borrowed money from Rodney Eubanks. Because of his inability to
repay promptly, Williams allegedly was forced to make the first drug run
up to New York. He also participated in another drug run. In other
words, the evidence does not suggest that he was forced to make these
runs, he did this of his own volition to help pay off his debt. By
becoming involved with this drug ring, Williams through his own
recklessness made others aware of his connection with Eubanks, including
his abductors. Williams was readily identifiable to those in the
organization, including his abductors, and the abductors acted
accordingly. This was a situation that would not have occurred but for
Williams's association with the drug organization. Considering these
facts and the applicable law, we conclude that Williams's assertion that
the defense of duress applies is unavailing.[^49]

Attempted Robbery

Appellant next asserts that because the trial court's finding that
"Reverend Hale was completely innocént" means that "\[Hale's\] apartment
could not have been the stash house, and that \[Williams\] must have
known this" and further that "\[Williams\] could not have entered the
apartment with the intent to steal drugs and money from the apartment,
because he knew they would not be there." We disagree and explain.

In *Osborne v. State,* 4 Md.App. 57, 60, 241 A.2d 171 (1967), Chief
Judge Murphy (now Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals) explained that

> \[rJobbery is larceny from the person, accompanied by violence or
> putting in fear. *Harrison v. State,* 3 Md.App. 148 \[152, 238 A.2d
> 153 (1968) \]. More specifically, to constitute robbery, the property
> must, as in larceny, be both taken and carried away, so that an
> asportation of the stolen property, as well as a trespass, would
> appear to be indispensable elements of the offense. To constitute an
> asportation, the robber, like the thief in larceny, must acquire
> complete control of the property at least for an instant, but the
> slightest asportation is sufficient to satisfy that element of the
> offense. *Clark and Marshall on Crimes* (6th Edition), § 12.12;
> *Perkins on Criminal Law,* p. 275.

*See also McCord v. State,* 15 Md.App. 63, 71, 289 A.2d 7 (1971)
(asserting that a "hair's breadth" asportation is sufficient.) In
*Bedford v. State,* 317 Md. 659, 667, 566 A.2d 111 (1989), the Court of
Appeals explained that a criminal attempt is

> governed by a 'substantial step' test, whereby a defendant will be
> found guilty of attempt only where the evidence demonstrates that he
> took 'substantial step\[s\] towards the commission of \[a\] crime
> whether or not his intention \[to commit that crime\] be accomplished
> \... \[and\] that no 'substantial step' will be found unless the
> conduct is 'strongly corroborative' of a criminal intention.

(quoting *Young v. State,* 303 Md. 298, 311, 493 A.2d 352 (1985)).

In *State v. Hawkins,* 326 Md. 270, 280-81, 604 A.2d 489 (1992), the
Court of Appeals explained that "\[a\] *principal in the second degree*
is one who is guilty of felony by reason of having aided, counseled,
commanded or encouraged the commission thereof in his presence, either
actual or constructive." (emphasis in the original) (quoting *State v.
Ward,* 284 Md. 189, 197, 396 A.2d 1041 (1978), *appeal after remand,*
290 Md. 76, 427 A.2d 1008 (1981)). *See also Oates v. State,* 97 Md.App.
180, 184, 627 A.2d 555 (1993). In the instant case, uncontroverted
evidence established that Williams directed the other men to Hale's
apartment. Hale testified that Williams helped the men in ransacking his
apartment. In fact, the appellant's fingerprints were found on two
drawers. Even if appellant did not intend to steal, he knew that the
others did. He aided, counseled and encouraged them in their attempt to
steal from Reverend Hale. As a principal in the second degree, he was
guilty as charged. Based upon this record, we cannot say that the trial
court's decision was "clearly erroneous."

SCDB 2005-073

No. 05-7053

**\[ ... \]**

Justice Stevens

delivered the opinion of the Court.

In January 2003, petitioner Keshia Dixon purchased multiple firearms at
two gun shows, during the course of which she provided an incorrect
address and falsely stated that she was not under indictment for a
felony. As a result of these illegal acts, petitioner was indicted and
convicted on one count of receiving a firearm while under indictment in
violation of 18 U. S. C. § 922(n) and eight counts of making false
statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation
of § 922(a)(6). At trial, petitioner admitted that she knew she was
under indictment when she made the purchases and that she knew doing so
was a crime; her defense was that she acted under duress because her
boyfriend threatened to kill her or hurt her daughters if she did not
buy the guns for him.

Petitioner contends that the trial judge's instructions to the jury
erroneously required her to prove duress by a preponderance of the
evidence instead of requiring the Government to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that she did not act under duress. The Court of Appeals
rejected petitioner's contention, 413 F. 3d 520 (CA5 2005); given
contrary treatment of the issue by other federal courts,[^50] we granted
certiorari, 546 U. S. 1135 (2006).

I

At trial, in her request for jury instructions on her defense of duress,
petitioner contended that she "should have the burden of production, and
then that the Government should be required to disprove beyond a
reasonable doubt the duress." App. 300. Petitioner admitted that this
request was contrary to Fifth Circuit precedent, and the trial court,
correctly finding itself bound by Circuit precedent, denied petitioner's
request. *Ibid.* Instead, the judge's instructions to the jury defined
the elements of the duress defense and stated that petitioner has "the
burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of
the evidence." *Id.,* at 312.

Petitioner argues here, as she did in the District Court and the Court
of Appeals, that federal law requires the Government to bear the burden
of disproving her defense beyond a reasonable doubt and that the trial
court's erroneous instruction on this point entitles her to a new trial.
There are two aspects to petitioner's argument in support of her
proposed instruction that merit separate discussion. First, petitioner
contends that her defense "controverted the *mens rea* required for
conviction" and therefore that the Due Process Clause requires the
Government to retain the burden of persuasion on that element. Brief for
Petitioner 41. Second, petitioner argues that the Fifth Circuit's rule
is "contrary to modern common law." *Id.,* at 14.

II

The crimes for which petitioner was convicted require that she have
acted "knowingly," § 922(a)(6), or "willfully," § 924(a)(1)(D).[^51] As
we have explained, "unless the text of the statute dictates a different
result, the term 'knowingly' merely requires proof of knowledge of the
facts that constitute the offense." *Bryan* v. *United States,* 524 U.
S. 184, 193 (1998) (footnote omitted). And the term "willfully" in §
924(a)(1)(D) requires a defendant to have "acted with knowledge that his
conduct was unlawful." *Ibid.* In this case, then, the Government bore
the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew she
was making false statements in connection with the acquisition of
firearms and that she knew she was breaking the law when she acquired a
firearm while under indictment. See *In re Winship,* 397 U. S. 358, 364
(1970). Although the Government may have proved these elements in other
ways, it clearly met its burden when petitioner testified that she
knowingly committed certain acts---she put a false address on the forms
she completed to purchase the firearms, falsely claimed that she was the
actual buyer of the firearms, and falsely stated that she was not under
indictment at the time of the purchase---and when she testified that she
knew she was breaking the law when, as an individual under indictment at
the time, she purchased a firearm. App. 221-222.

Petitioner contends, however, that she cannot have formed the necessary
*mens rea* for these crimes because she did not freely choose to commit
the acts in question. But even if we assume that petitioner's will was
overborne by the threats made against her and her daughters, she still
*knew* that she was making false statements and *knew* that she was
breaking the law by buying a firearm. The duress defense, like the
defense of necessity that we considered in *United States* v. *Bailey,*
444 U. S. 394, 409-410 (1980), may excuse conduct that would otherwise
be punishable, but the existence of duress normally does not controvert
any of the elements of the offense itself.[^52] As we explained in
*Bailey,* "\[c\]riminal liability is normally based upon the concurrence
of two factors, \'an evil-meaning mind \[and\] and evil-doing
hand\_\_\_\_' " *Id.,* at 402 (quoting *Morissette* v. *United States,*
342 U. S. 246, 251 (1952)). Like the defense of necessity, the defense
of duress does not negate a defendant's criminal state of mind when the
applicable offense requires a defendant to have acted knowingly or
willfully; instead, it allows the defendant to "avoid liability . . .
because coercive conditions or necessity negates a conclusion of guilt
even though the necessary *mens rea* was present." *Bailey,* 444 U. S.,
at 402.[^53]

The fact that petitioner's crimes are statutory offenses that have no
counterpart in the common law also supports our conclusion that her
duress defense in no way disproves an element of those crimes. We have
observed that "\[t\]he definition of the elements of a criminal offense
is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal
crimes, which are solely creatures of statute." *Liparota* v. *United
States,* 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985). Here, consistent with the movement
away from the traditional dichotomy of general versus specific intent
and toward a more specifically defined hierarchy of culpable mental
states, see *Bailey,* 444 U. S., at 403-404, Congress defined the crimes
at issue to punish defendants who act "knowingly," § 922(a)(6), or
"willfully," § 924(a)(1)(D). It is these specific mental states, rather
than some vague "evil mind," Brief for Petitioner 42, or " 'criminal'
intent," *Martin* v. *Ohio,* 480 U. S. 228, 235 (1987), that the
Government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, see
*Patterson* v. *New York,* 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977) ("The
applicability of the reasonable-doubt standard, however, has always been
dependent on how a State defines the offense that is charged in any
given case"). The jury instructions in this case were consistent with
this requirement and, as such, did not run afoul of the Due Process
Clause when they placed the burden on petitioner to establish the
existence of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.

Ill

Having found no constitutional basis for placing upon the Government the
burden of disproving petitioner's duress de-. fense beyond a reasonable
doubt, we next address petitioner's argument that the modern common law
requires the Government to bear that burden. In making this argument,
petitioner recognizes that, until the end of the 19th century,
common-law courts generally adhered to the rule that "the proponent of
an issue bears the burden of persuasion on the factual premises for
applying the rule." Fletcher, Two Kinds of Legal Rules: A Comparative
Study of Burden-of-Persuasion Practices in Criminal Cases, 77 Yale L. J.
880, 898 (1967-1968). In petitioner's view, however, two important
developments have established a contrary common-law rule that now
prevails in federal courts: this Court's decision in *Davis* v. *United
States,* 160 U. S. 469 (1895), which placed the burden on the Government
to prove a defendant's sanity, and the publication of the Model Penal
Code in 1962.

Although undisputed in this case, it bears repeating that, at common
law, the burden of proving "affirmative defenses---indeed, 'all\...
circumstances of justification, excuse or alleviation'---rested on the
defendant." *Patterson,* 432 U. S., at 202 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries \*201); see also *Martin* v. *Ohio,* 480 U. S., at 235;
*Mullaney* v. *Wilbur,* 421 U. S. 684, 693 (1975). This common-law rule
accords with the general evidentiary rule that "the burdens of producing
evidence and of persuasion with regard to any given issue are both
generally allocated to the same party." 2 J. Strong, McCormick on
Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999). And, in the context of the defense
of duress, it accords with the doctrine that "where the facts with
regard to an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a party, that
party has the burden of proving the issue." *Id.,* at 418. Although she
claims that the common-law rule placing the burden on a defendant to
prove the existence of duress "was the product of flawed reasoning,"
petitioner accepts that this was the general rule, at least until this
Court's decision in *Davis.* Brief for Petitioner 18. According to
petitioner, however, *Davis* initiated a revolution that overthrew the
old common-law rule and established her proposed rule in its place.

*Davis* itself, however, does not support petitioner's position. In that
case, we reviewed a defendant's conviction for having committed murder
"feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought." 160 U. S., at
474. It was undisputed that the prosecution's evidence, "if alone
considered, made it the duty of the jury to return a verdict of guilty
of the crime charged"; the defendant, however, adduced evidence at trial
tending to show that he did not have the mental capacity to form the
requisite intent. *Id.,* at 475. At issue before the Court was the
correctness of the trial judge's instruction to the jury that the law "
'presumes every man is sane, and the burden of showing it is not true is
upon the party who asserts it.'" *Id.,* at 476. Under this instruction,
"if the evidence was *in equilibrio* as to the accused being sane, that
is, capable of comprehending the nature and effect of his acts, he was
to be treated just as he would be if there were no defence of insanity
or if there were an entire absence of proof that he was insane." *Id.,*
at 479.

In reversing the defendant's conviction, we found ourselves "unable to
assent to the doctrine that *in a prosecution for* murder\... it is the
duty of the jury to convict where the evidence is equally balanced on
the issue as to the sanity of the accused at the time of the killing."
*Id.,* at 484 (emphasis added). Instead, we concluded that this
defendant was "entitled to an acquittal of *the specific crime charged*
if upon all the evidence there is reasonable doubt whether he was
capable in law of committing \[the\] crime." *Ibid,* (emphasis added).
Our opinion focused on the "definition of murder," explaining that "it
is of the very essence of that heinous crime that it be committed by a
person of 'sound memory and discretion,' and with 'malice
aforethought.'" *Ibid.* Reviewing "the adjudged cases" and "elementary
treatises upon criminal law," we found that "\[a\]ll admit that the
crime of murder necessarily involves the possession by the accused of
such mental capacity as will render him criminally responsible for his
acts." *Id.,* at 485. Thus, when we ultimately found that the burden of
proving the accused's sanity rested on the Government, our holding
rested on the conclusion that

> "\[Davis'\] guilt cannot be said to have been proved beyond a
> reasonable doubt---his will and his acts cannot be held to have joined
> in perpetrating the murder charged---if the jury, upon all the
> evidence, have a reasonable doubt whether he was legally capable of
> committing crime, or (which is the same thing) whether he wilfully,
> deliberately, unlawfully, and of malice aforethought took the life of
> the deceased. As the crime of murder involves sufficient capacity to
> distinguish between right and wrong, the legal interpretation of every
> verdict of guilty as charged is that the jury believed from all the
> evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty, and
> was therefore responsible, criminally, for his acts. How then upon
> principle or consistently with humanity can a verdict of guilty be
> properly returned, if the jury entertain a reasonable doubt as to the
> existence of a fact which is essential to guilt, namely, the capacity
> in law of the accused to commit that crime?" Id., at 488.

Our opinion in Davis, then, interpreted a defendant's sanity to
controvert the necessary *mens rea* for the crime of murder committed
"feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought," *id.,* at 474,
as "\[o\]ne who takes human life cannot be said to be actuated by malice
aforethought, or to have deliberately intended to take life, or to have
'a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart/ . . . unless at the time he
had sufficient mind to comprehend the criminality or the right and wrong
of such an act," *id.,* at 485. We required the Government to prove the
defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence that
tended to prove insanity also tended to disprove an essential element of
the offense charged. See *Davis* v. *United States,* 165 U. S. 373, 378
(1897) ("\[T\]he fact of sanity, *as any other essential fact in the
case,* must be established to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a
reasonable doubt" (emphasis added)). Whether or not this reasoning
correctly treated insanity as negating the *mens rea* for murder as
defined in the statute at issue, cf. n. 4, *supra,* it does not help
petitioner: The evidence of duress she adduced at trial does not
contradict or tend to disprove any element of the statutory offenses
that she committed.

Nor does the proposition for which *Davis* has come to stand help
petitioner's cause. Although written more narrowly in the context of a
prosecution for the crime of murder, *Davis* was later interpreted to
establish a general "rule for federal prosecutions . . . that an accused
is 'entitled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged if upon all
the evidence there is reasonable doubt whether he was capable in law of
committing crime.' " *Leland* v. *Oregon,* 343 U. S. 790, 797 (1952)
(quoting *Davis,* 160 U. S., at 484); see also *Lynch* v. *Overholser,*
369 U. S. 705, 713 (1962) (explaining that the *Davis* rule applied in
all federal courts). After *Davis,* if a federal defendant introduced
sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his sanity, it was
sufficient to create a question for the jury on which the Government
bore the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt. See,
*e. g., Hall* v. *United States,* 295 F. 2d 26, 28 (CA4 1961);
*Holloway* v. *United States,* 148 F. 2d 665, 666 (CADC 1945); *Post* v.
*United States,* 135 F. 1, 10 (CA5 1905).

In apparent recognition of the fact that *Davis* relied on the
heightened *mens rea* applicable to the particular statute at issue, we
held in *Leland* that this rule was not constitutionally mandated, 343
U. S., at 797, and Congress overruled it by statute in 1984, requiring a
defendant to prove his insanity by clear and convincing evidence, 98
Stat. 2057, codified at 18 U. S. C. § 17(b). Moreover, Congress has
treated the defense of insanity differently from that of duress not only
by codifying it but by requiring defendants who intend to rely on an
insanity defense to provide advance notice to the Government. See Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 12.2(a). Thus, even if the rule arising from *Davis*
may have once been relevant to an evaluation of other affirmative
defenses, Congress' differential treatment of the insanity defense and
its rejection of the *Davis* rule are inconsistent with petitioner's
invitation to follow *Davis'* lead in this case.

Indeed, petitioner's reliance on *Davis* ignores the fact that federal
crimes "are solely creatures of statute," *Liparota,* 471 U. S., at 424,
and therefore that we are required to effectuate the duress defense as
Congress "may have contemplated" it in the context of these specific
offenses, *United States* v. *Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,* 532
U. S. 483, 491, n. 3 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
*id.,* at 499 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that
Court was addressing whether the statute at issue foreclosed a necessity
defense to specific charges brought under the statute); *Bailey,* 444 U.
S., at 410 ("We need not speculate now, however, on the precise contours
of whatever defenses of duress or necessity are available against
charges brought under \[18 U. S. C.J § 751(a)"). The offenses at issue
in this case were created by statute in 1968, when Congress enacted the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (hereinafter Safe Streets Act
or Act). See 82 Stat. 197. There is no evidence in the Act's structure
or history that Congress actually considered the question of how the
duress defense should work in this context, and there is no suggestion
that the offenses at issue are incompatible with a defense of
duress.[^54] Cf. *Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,* 532 U. S., at
491. Assuming that a defense of duress is available to the statutory
crimes at issue,[^55] then, we must determine what that defense would
look like as Congress "may have contemplated" it.

As discussed above, the common law long required the defendant to bear
the burden of proving the existence of duress. Similarly, even where
Congress has enacted an affirmative defense in the proviso of a statute,
the "settled rule in this jurisdiction \[is\] that an indictment or
other pleading . . . need not negative the matter of an exception made
by a proviso or other distinct clause . . . and that it is incumbent on
one who relies on such an exception to set it up and establish it."
*McKelvey* v. *United States,* 260 U. S. 353, 357 (1922); see also
*United States* v. *Dickson,* 15 Pet. 141, 165 (1841) (calling this "the
general rule of law which has always prevailed, and become consecrated
almost as a maxim in the interpretation of statutes"). Even though the
Safe Streets Act does not mention the defense of duress, we can safely
assume that the 1968 Congress was familiar with both the
long-established common-law rule[^56] and the rule applied in *McKelvey*
and that it would have expected federal courts to apply a similar
approach to any affirmative defense that might be asserted as a
justification or excuse for violating the new law.[^57]

This conclusion is surely more reasonable than petitioner's hypothesis
that *Davis* dramatically upset a well-settled rule of law. Petitioner
cites only one federal case decided before 1968 for the proposition that
it has been well established in federal law that the Government bears
the burden of disproving duress beyond a reasonable doubt. But that case
involved a defendant's claim that he "lacked the specific intent to
defraud required by the statute for the reason that he committed the
offense under duress and coercion." *Johnson* v. *United States,* 291 F.
2d 150, 152 (CA8 1961). Thus, when the Court of Appeals explained that
"there is no burden upon the defendant to prove his defense of
coercion," *id.,* at 155, that statement is best understood in context
as a corollary to the by-then-unremarkable proposition that "the burden
of proof rests upon the Government to prove the defendant's guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt," *ibid.* Properly understood, *Johnson* provides
petitioner little help in her uphill struggle to prove that a dramatic
shift in the federal common-law rule occurred between *Davis* and the
enactment of the Safe Streets Act in 1968.

Indeed, for us to be able to accept petitioner's proposition, we would
need to find an overwhelming consensus among federal courts that it is
the Government's burden to disprove the existence of duress beyond a
reasonable doubt. The existence today of disagreement among the Federal
Courts of Appeals on this issue, however---the very disagreement that
caused us to grant certiorari in this case, see n. 1, supra---
demonstrates that no such consensus has ever existed. See also *post,*
at 25-27 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (discussing differences in treatment
of the duress defense by the various Courts of Appeals). Also
undermining petitioner's argument is the fact that, in 1970, the
National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws proposed that a
defendant prove the existence of duress by a preponderance of the
evidence. See 1 Working Papers 278. Moreover, while there seem to be
few, if any, *post-Davis,* pre-1968 cases placing the burden on a
defendant to prove the existence of duress,[^58] or even discussing the
issue in any way, this lack of evidence does not help petitioner. The
long-established common-law rule is that the burden of proving duress
rests on the defendant. Petitioner hypothesizes that *Davis* fomented a
revolution upsetting this rule. If this were true, one would expect to
find cases discussing the matter. But no such cases exist.

It is for a similar reason that we give no weight to the publication of
the Model Penal Code in 1962. As petitioner notes, the Code would place
the burden on the government to disprove the existence of duress beyond
a reasonable doubt. See ALI, Model Penal Code § 1.12, p. 88 (2001)
(hereinafter Model Penal Code or Code) (stating that each element of an
offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt); § 1.13(9)(c), at 91
(defining as an element anything that negatives an excuse for the
conduct at issue); §2.09, at 131-132 (establishing affirmative defense
of duress). Petitioner argues that the Code reflects "well established"
federal law as it existed at the time. Brief for Petitioner 25. But, as
discussed above, no such consensus existed when Congress passed the Safe
Streets Act in 1968. And even if we assume Congress' familiarity with
the Code and the rule it would establish, there is no evidence that
Congress endorsed the Code's views or incorporated them into the Safe
Streets Act.

In fact, the Act itself provides evidence to the contrary. Despite the
Code's careful delineation of mental states, see Model Penal Code §2.02,
at 94-95, the Safe Streets Act attached no explicit *mens rea*
requirement to the crime of receiving a firearm while under indictment,
§ 924(a), 82 Stat. 233 ("Whoever violates any provision of this chapter
\... shall be fined not more than \$5,000 or imprisoned not more than
five years, or both"). And when Congress amended the Act to impose a
*mens rea* requirement, it punished people who "willfully" violate the
statute, see § 104(a), 100 Stat. 456, a mental state that has not been
embraced by the Code, see Model Penal Code \'§ 2.02(2), at 94-95
(defining "purposely," "knowingly," "recklessly," and "negligently");
*id.,* Explanatory Note, at 97 ("Though the term 'wilfully' is not used
in the definitions of crimes contained in the Code, its currency and its
existence in offenses outside the criminal code suggest the desirability
of clarification"). Had Congress intended to adopt the Code's structure
when it enacted or amended the Safe Streets Act, one would expect the
Act's form and language to adhere much more closely to that used by the
Code. It does not, and, for that reason, we cannot rely on the Model
Penal Code to provide evidence as to how Congress would have wanted us
to effectuate the duress defense in this context.

IV

Congress can, if it chooses, enact a duress defense that places the
burden on the Government to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt.
In light of Congress' silence on the issue, however, it is up to the
federal courts to effectuate the affirmative defense of duress as
Congress "may have contemplated" it in an offense-specific context.
*Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,* 532 U. S., at 491, n. 3
(internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of the firearms
offenses at issue---as will usually be the case, given the
long-established common-law rule---we presume that Congress intended the
petitioner to bear the burden of proving the defense of duress by a
preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

Justice Kennedy,

concurring.

No one disputes that, subject to constitutional constraints, Congress
has the authority to determine the content of a duress defense with
respect to federal crimes and to direct whether the burden of proof
rests with the defense or the prosecution. The question here is how to
proceed when Congress has enacted a criminal statute, the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 197 *et seq.*
(hereinafter Safe Streets Act), without explicit instructions regarding
the duress defense or its burden of proof. See *ante,* at 12-13.

When issues of congressional intent with respect to the nature, extent,
and definition of federal crimes arise, we assume Congress acted against
certain background understandings set forth in judicial decisions in the
Anglo-American legal tradition. See *United States* v. *Bailey,* 444 U.
S. 394, 415, n. 11 (1980). Those decisions, in turn, consult sources
such as legal treatises and the American Legal Institute's Model Penal
Code. See, *e. g., United States* v. *Jimenez Recio,* 537 U. S. 270,
275-276 (2003); *Salinas* v. *United States,* 522 U. S. 52, 64-65
(1997). All of these sources rely upon the insight gained over time as
the legal process continues. Absent some contrary indication in the
statute, we can assume that Congress would not want to foreclose the
courts from consulting these newer sources and considering innovative
arguments in resolving issues not confronted in the statute and not
within the likely purview of Congress when it enacted the criminal
prohibition applicable in the particular case.

While the Court looks to the state of the law at the time the statute
was enacted, see *ante,* at 14, the better reading of the Court's
opinion is that isolated authorities or writings do not control unless
they were indicative of guiding principles upon which Congress likely
would have relied. Otherwise, it seems altogether a fiction to attribute
to Congress any intent one way or the other in assigning the burden of
proof. It seems unlikely, moreover, that Congress would have wanted the
burden of proof for duress to vary from statute to statute depending
upon the date of enactment. Consistent with these propositions, the
Court looks not only to our precedents and common-law traditions, but
also to the treatment of the insanity defense in a 1984 statute and a
proposal of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws,
even though they both postdated the passage of the Safe Streets Act. See
*ante,* at 12, 15.

As there is no reason to suppose that Congress wanted to depart from the
traditional principles for allocating the burden of proof, the proper
approach is simply to apply these principles to the context of duress.
See, *e. g., Schaffer* v. *Weast,* 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005) (where the
plain text of the statute is "silent on the allocation of the burden of
persuasion," we proceed to consider the "ordinary default rule" and its
exceptions). The facts needed to prove or disprove the defense "lie
peculiarly in the knowledge of" the defendant. 2 K. Broun, McCormick on
Evidence §337, p. 475 (6th ed. 2006); see *ante,* at 8-9. The claim of
duress in most instances depends upon conduct that takes place before
the criminal act; and, as the person who allegedly coerced the defendant
is often unwilling to come forward and testify, the prosecution may be
without any practical means of disproving the defendant's allegations.
There is good reason, then, to maintain the usual rule of placing the
burden of production and persuasion together on the party raising the
issue. See 2 Broun, *supra,* §337; *ante,* at 8. The analysis may come
to a different result, of course, for other defenses.

With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Alito, with whom Justice Scalia joins, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court with the understanding that it does not
hold that the allocation of the burden of persuasion on the defense of
duress may vary from one federal criminal statute to another.

Duress was an established defense at common law. See 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 30 (1769). When Congress began to
enact federal criminal statutes, it presumptively intended for those
offenses to be subject to this defense. Moreover, Congress presumptively
intended for the burdens of production and persuasion to be placed, as
they were at common law, on the defendant. Although Congress is
certainly free to alter this pattern and place one or both burdens on
the prosecution, either for all or selected federal crimes, Congress has
not done so but instead has continued to revise the federal criminal
laws and to create new federal crimes without addressing the issue of
duress. Under these circumstances, I believe that the burdens remain
where they were when Congress began enacting federal criminal statutes.

I do not assume that Congress makes a new, implicit judgment about the
allocation of these burdens whenever it ereates a new federal crime or,
for that matter, whenever it substantially revises an existing criminal
statute. \' It is unrealistic to assume that on every such occasion
Congress surveys the allocation of the burdens of proof on duress under
the existing federal case law and under the law of the States and
tacitly adopts whatever the predominant position happens to be at the
time. Such a methodology would create serious problems for the district
courts and the courts of appeals when they are required to decide where
the burden of persuasion should be allocated for federal crimes enacted
on different dates. If the allocation differed for different offenses,
there might be federal criminal cases in which the trial judge would be
forced to instruct the jury that the defendant bears the burden of
persuasion on this defense for some of the offenses charged in the
indictment and that the prosecution bears the burden on others.

I would also not assume, as Justice Breyer does, see *post,* at 22
(dissenting opinion), that Congress has implicitly delegated to the
federal courts the task of deciding in the manner of a common-law court
where the burden of persuasion should be allocated. The allocation of
this burden is a debatable policy question with an important empirical
component. In the absence of specific direction from Congress, cf. Fed.
Rule Evid. 501, I would not assume that Congress has conferred this
authority on the Judiciary.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter joins, dissenting.

Courts have long recognized that "duress" constitutes a defense to a
criminal charge. Historically, that defense "excuse\[d\] criminal
conduct" if (1) a "threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury"
led the defendant to commit the crime, (2) the defendant had no
reasonable, legal alternative to breaking the law, and (3) the defendant
was not responsible for creating the threat. *United States* v.
*Bailey,* 444 U. S. 394, 409-410 (1980); see also 2 W. LaFave,
Substantive Criminal Law § 9.7(b), pp. 74-82 (2003) (hereinafter
LaFave); *ante,* at 4, n. 1 (opinion of the Court). The Court decides
today in respect to *federal* crimes that the defense must bear the
burden of both producing evidence of duress and persuading the jury. I
agree with the majority that the burden of production lies on the
defendant, that here the burden of persuasion issue is not
constitutional, and that Congress may allocate that burden as it sees
fit. But I also believe that, in the absence of any indication of a
different congressional intent, the burden of persuading the jury beyond
a reasonable doubt should lie where such burdens normally lie in
criminal cases, upon the prosecution.

I

My disagreement with the majority in part reflects my different view
about how we should determine the relevant congressional intent. Where
Congress speaks about burdens of proof, we must, of course, follow what
it says. But suppose, as is normally the case, that the relevant federal
statute is silent. The majority proceeds on the assumption that Congress
wished courts to fill the gap by examining judicial practice *at the
time that Congress enacted the particular criminal statute in question.
Ante,* at 12-16. I would not follow that approach.

To believe Congress intended the placement of such burdens to vary from
statute to statute and time to time is both unrealistic and risks
unnecessary complexity, jury confusion, and unfairness. It is
unrealistic because the silence could well mean only that Congress did
not specifically consider the "burden of persuasion" in respect to a
duress defense. It simply did not think about that secondary matter. Had
it done so, would Congress have wanted courts to freeze current practice
statute by statute? Would it have wanted to impose different
burden-of-proof requirements where claims of duress are identical, where
statutes are similar, where the *only* relevant difference is the time
of enactment? Why? Indeed, individual instances of criminal conduct
often violate several statutes. In a trial for those violations, is the
judge to instruct the jury to apply different standards of proof to a
duress defense depending upon when Congress enacted the particular
statute in question? What if in this very case the defendant's boyfriend
had given her drug money and insisted (under threat of death) not only
that she use some of the money to buy him a gun, but that she launder
the rest? See 18 U. S. C. § 1956 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); see *infra,*
at 25-27.

I would assume instead that Congress' silence typically means that
Congress expected the courts to develop burden rules governing
affirmative defenses as they have done in the past, by beginning with
the common law and taking full account of the subsequent need for that
law to evolve through judicial practice informed by reason and
experience. See *Davis* v. *United States,* 160 U. S. 469 (1895);
*McNabb* v. *United States,* 318 U. S. 332, 341 (1943); *ante,* at 14,
n. 8 (opinion of the Court) (proposed general revision of the federal
criminal code would have instructed courts to determine the contours of
affirmative defenses " 'according to the principles of the common law as
they may be interpreted in the light of reason and experience' "); 9 J.
Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981)
(allocation of the burdens of proof present courts with questions "of
policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations").
That approach would produce uniform federal practice across different
affirmative defenses, as well as across statutes passed at different
points in time.

II

My approach leads me to conclude that in federal criminal cases, the
prosecution should bear the duress defense burden of persuasion. The
issue is a close one. In Blackstone's time the accused bore the burden
of proof for all affirmative defenses. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
\*201; *Patterson* v. *New York,* 432 U. S. 197, 201-202 (1977). And
20th-century experts have taken different positions on the matter. The
Model Penal Code, for example, recommends placing the burden of
persuasion on the prosecution. ALI, Model Penal Code §1.12, p. 16, §
1.13(9)(c), p. 18, §2.09, pp. 37-38 (1985). The Brown Commission
recommends placing it upon the defendant. 1 National Commission on
Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, Working Papers 278 (1970). And the
proposed revision of the federal criminal code, agnostically, would have
turned the matter over to the courts for decision. S. 1722, 96th Cong.,
1st Sess., §501 (1979). Moreover, there is a practical argument that
favors the Government's position here, namely, that defendants should
bear the burden of persuasion because defendants often have superior
access to the relevant proof.

Nonetheless, several factors favor placing the burden on the
prosecution. For one thing, in certain respects the question of duress
resembles that of *mens rea,* an issue that is always for the
prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. See *In re Winship,* 397
U. S. 358, 364 (1970); *Martin* v. *Ohio,* 480 U. S. 228, 234 (1987).
The questions are not the same. The defendant's criminal activity here
was voluntary; no external principle, such as the wind, propelled her
when she acted. The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle, p. 54 (R. Browne
transí. 1865). Moreover, her actions were intentional. Whether she
wanted to buy the guns or not, and whether she wanted to lie while doing
so or not, she decided to do these things and knew that she was doing
them. Indeed, her action was willful in the sense that she knew that to
do them was to break the law. *Ante,* at 5-7 (opinion of the Court); see
also *Ratzlaf* v. *United States,* 510 U. S. 135, 136-137 (1994).

Nonetheless, where a defendant acts under duress, she lacks any
semblance of a meaningful choice. In that sense her choice is not free.
As Blackstone wrote, the criminal law punishes "abuse\[s\] of th\[e\]
free will"; hence "it is highly just and equitable that a man should be
excused for those acts, which are done through unavoidable force and
compulsion." 4 Commentaries \*27. And it is in this "force and
compulsion," acting upon the will, that the resemblance to lack of *mens
rea* lies. Cf. Austin, Ifs and Cans, in Proceedings of the British
Academy 123-124 (1956) (noting difference between choosing to do
something where one has the opportunity and ability to do otherwise and
choosing to do something where one lacks any such opportunity or
ability). *Davis* v. *United States, supra,* allocated the federal
insanity defense burden to the Government partly for these reasons. That
case, read in light of *Leland* v. *Oregon,* 343 U. S. 790, 797 (1952),
suggests that, even if insanity does not always show the absence of
*mens rea,* it does show the absence of a " *'vicious* will.' " *Davis,
supra,* at 484 (citing Blackstone; emphasis added).

For another thing, federal courts (as a matter of statutory construction
or supervisory power) have imposed the federal-crime burden of
persuasion upon the prosecution in respect to self-defense, insanity,
and entrapment, which resemble the duress defense in certain relevant
ways. In respect to both duress and self-defense, for example, the
defendant's illegal act is voluntary, indeed, intentional; but the
circumstances deprive the defendant of any meaningful ability or
opportunity to act otherwise, depriving the defendant of a choice that
is free. Insanity, as I said, may involve circumstances that resemble,
but are not identical to, a lack of *mens rea.* And entrapment requires
the prosecution to prove that the defendant was "predisposed" to commit
the crime---a matter sometimes best known to the defendant.

As to self-defense, see First Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions
§ 5.04 (1998); *United States* v. *Thomas,* 34 F. 3d 44, 47 (CA2 1994);
*Government of Virgin Islands* v. *Smith,* 949 F. 2d 677, 680 (CA3
1991); *United States* v. *Harris,* Nos. 95-5637, 95-5638, 1996 U. S.
App. LEXIS 22040, \*4-\*5 (CA4, Aug. 27, 1996); *United States* v.
*Branch,* 91 F. 3d 699, 714, n. 1 (CA5 1996); Sixth Circuit Pattern
Criminal Jury Instructions § 6.06 (2005); *United States* v. *Jackson,*

883 (CA10 1977); *United States* v. *Alvarez,* 755 F. 2d 830, 842 (CA11
1985); *Bynum* v. *United States,* 408 F. 2d 1207 (CADC 1968); see also
*Mullaney* v. *Wilbur,* 421 U. S. 684, 702, n. 30 (1975) (noting this as
the "'majority rule'").

As to insanity, see *Davis,* 160 U. S., at 486; *Leland, supra,* at 797
(making clear that *Davis* determined burden allocations as a matter of
federal, but not constitutional, law); but see 18 U. S. C. § 17(b)
(overruling this default rule to place the burden on the defendant by
clear and convincing evidence). As to entrapment, see *Jacobson* v.
*United States,* 503 U. S. 540, 554 (1992) (reversing the judgment
affirming the conviction because "the prosecution failed, as a matter of
law, to adduce evidence to support the jury verdict that petitioner was
predisposed, independent of the Government's acts and beyond a
reasonable doubt," to commit the crime). See also *Patterson,* 432 U.
S., at 202 (noting that *Davis* "had wide impact on the practice in the
federal courts with respect to the burden of proving various affirmative
defenses"); *Patterson, supra,* at 231 (Powell, J., dissenting)
("\[SJince this Court's decision in *Davis* . . . federal prosecutors
have borne the burden of persuasion with respect to factors like
insanity, self-defense, and malice or provocation, once the defendant
has carried this burden of production").

Further, most federal courts, in respect to most federal crimes, have
imposed the burden of persuasion in respect to the duress defense upon
the Government, following *Johnson* v. *United States,* 291 F. 2d 150,
155 (CA8 1961), and authorities such as E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal
Jury Practice and Instructions § 13.14, p. 293 (2d ed. 1970), and Sthe
Federal Judicial Center Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions §56 (1988).
By the mid-1990's, seven Circuits had squarely placed the burden of
persuasion upon the prosecution; one Circuit (the Fifth) placed the
burden on the defendant; and four (the Third, Fourth, Eleventh, and
District of Columbia) did not, as far as I can tell, have a definitive
practice. Compare *United States* v. *Arthurs,* 73 F. 3d 444, 448 (CA1
1996); *United States* v. *Mitchell,* 725 F. 2d 832, 836 (CA2 1983);
*United States* v. *Campbell,* 675 F. 2d 815, 821 (CA6 1982); *United
States* v. *Talbott,* 78 F. 3d 1183, 1186 (CA7 1996) *(per curiam);
United States* v. *Campbell,* 609 F. 2d 922, 925 (CA8 1979); *United
States* v. *Hearst,* 563 F. 2d 1331, 1336, and n. 2 (CA9 1977) *(per
curiam);* and *United States* v. *Falcon,* 766 F. 2d 1469, 1477 (CA10
1985), with *United States* v. *Willis,* 38 F. 3d 170, 179 (CA5 1994)
(putting the burden on the defendant by a preponderance). Compare also
First Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions § 5.05 (1998); Sixth
Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions §6.05 (1991); Seventh Circuit
Pattern Criminal Federal Jury Instructions § 6.08 (1998); and Eighth
Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions §§3.09, 9.02 (2000), with
Fifth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions §1.36 (2001).
Petitioner adds, without contradiction, that the States allocate the
burden similarly by a ratio of 2 to 1. Brief for Petitioner 32-34; Brief
for United States 38, n. 30.

Beginning in 1991, the matter became more complicated because the Ninth
Circuit began to require the defendant to bear the burden of proving
duress in certain circumstances. *United States* v. *Dominguez-Mestas,*
929 F. 2d 1379, 1382, 1384 *(per curiam).* And a few years later the
Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits followed suit in cases concerning a
closely related justification defense. See *United States* v. *Dodd,*
225 F. 3d 340, 347-350 (CA3 2000); *United States* v. *Brown,* 367 F. 3d
549, 555-556 (CA6 2004); *United States* v. *Deleveaux,* 205 F. 3d 1292,
1298-1300 (CA11 2000); Eleventh Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury
Instructions § 16 (2003). But see Sixth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury
Instructions §6.05 (2005) (stating that the burden-of-proof issue for
duress is undecided in that Circuit).

These latter cases, however, put the burden on the defendant only where
the criminal statute narrows its *mens rea* requirement, *i. e.,* the
burden is the defendant's where the statute requires that the defendant
act with "knowledge" but not, suggest these courts, where the statute
requires that the defendant act "willfully," "intentionally," or
"voluntarily." See, *e. g., Dominguez-Mestas, supra,* at 1382, 1384;
*United States* v. *Meraz-Solomon,* 3 F. 3d 298, 300 (CA9 1993) *(per
curiam);* Ninth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions §§6.5, 6.6
(2003); but see *United States* v. *Fei Lin,* 139 F. 3d 1303, 1307-1308
(CA9 1998). See also Eleventh Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions
§ 16 (2003); *United States* v. *Diaz,* 285 F. 3d 92, 97 (CA1 2002)
(indicating that this bifurcated rule might be appropriate, but noting
Circuit precedent to the contrary). Similarly, the Tenth Circuit placed
the burden of proving duress upon the defendant in "strict liability"
cases where *mens rea* is not an element of the crime at all. *United
States* v. *Unser,* 165 F. 3d 755, 763-765 (1999).

The apparent upshot is that four Circuits now place the burden of
persuasion on the prosecution across the board; one places the burden on
the prosecution if the statute requires *mens rea* but not otherwise;
and four have held or suggested that the burden should be on the
prosecution if the statute requires an intentional or willful state of
mind, but not if the statute requires only knowledge. While the Circuits
are divided, apparently only one (the Fifth) agrees with the position
taken by the Court today.

Further, while I concede the logic of the Government's practical
argument---that defendants have superior access to the evidence---I
remain uncertain of the argument's strength. After all, "\[i\]n every
criminal case the defendant has at least an equal familiarity with the
facts and in most a greater familiarity with them than the prosecution."
*Tot* v. *United States,* 319 U. S. 463, 469 (1943). And the strict
contours of the duress defense, as well as the defendant's burden of
production, already substantially narrow the circumstances under which
the defense may be used. A defendant may find it difficult, for example,
to show duress where the relevant conduct took place too long before the
criminal act. Cf. *ante,* at 18-19 (Kennedy, J., concurring). That is
because the defendant must show that he had no alternative to breaking
the law. *Supra,* at 20-21. And that will be the more difficult to show
the more remote the threat. See also LaFave § 9.7, at 77-79 (duress
generally requires an "immediate" or "imminent" threat, that the
defendant "take advantage of a reasonable opportunity to escape," and
that the defendant "terminate his conduct 'as soon as the claimed duress
. . . had lost its coercive force'"). More important, the need to prove
*mens rea* can easily present precisely the same practical difficulties
of proof for the prosecutor. Suppose for example the defendant claims
that an old lady told him that the white powder he transported across
the border was medicine for her dying son. Cf. *United States* v.
*Mares,* 441 F. 3d 1152 (CA10 2006). See also *Mullaney* v. *Wilbur,*
421 U. S., at 702 (requiring the government to prove an absence of
passion in a murder conviction imposes "no unique hardship on the
prosecution").

It is particularly difficult to see a practical distinction between this
affirmative defense and, say, self-defense. The Government says that the
prosecution may "be unable to call the witness most likely to have
information bearing on the point," namely, the defendant. Brief for
United States 21. But what is the difference in this respect between the
defendant here, who says her boyfriend threatened to kill her, and a
battered woman who says that she killed her husband in self-defense,
where the husband's evidence is certainly unavailable? See also
*Jacobson,* 503 U. S. 540 (entrapment; need to prove "propensity").
Regardless, unless the defendant testifies, it could prove difficult to
satisfy the defendant's burden of *production;* and, of course, once the
defendant testifies, cross-examination is possible.

In a word, I cannot evaluate the claim of practicality without somewhat
more systematic evidence of the existence of a problem, say, in those
Circuits that for many years have imposed the burden on the prosecutor.
And, of course, if I am wrong about the Government's practical need (and
were my views to prevail), the Government would remain free to ask
Congress to reallocate the burden.

Finally, there is a virtue in uniformity, in treating the federal
statutory burden of persuasion similarly in respect to *actus reus, mens
rea,* mistake, self-defense, entrapment, and duress. The Second Circuit,
when imposing the burden of persuasion for duress on the prosecution,
wrote that differences in this respect create "a grave possibility of
juror confusion." *United States* v. *Mitchell,* 725 F. 2d 832, 836
(1983) (Newman, J., joined by Feinberg, C. J., and Friendly, J.). They
risk unfairness as well.

For these reasons I believe that, in the absence of an indication of
congressional intent to the contrary, federal criminal law should place
the burden of persuasion in respect to the duress defense upon the
prosecution, which, as is now common in respect to many affirmative
defenses, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. With respect, I
dissent.

LYNCH, Circuit Judge.

Defendant Robert C. Luisi, Jr., an admitted member of the "La Cosa
Nostra" (LCN) crime family, appeals his convictions on three
cocaine-related charges. These convictions stemmed from an FBI
investigation that employed a paid cooperating witness and LCN member,
Ronald Previte.

At trial, Luisi testified and admitted his involvement in the cocaine
transactions. His defense was entrapment, on intertwined theories. He
claimed that Previte, acting for the government along with undercover
FBI agent Michael McGowan, had improperly tried to induce him to commit
drug crimes. He further claimed that when he resisted, Previte persuaded
Philadelphia LCN boss Joseph Merlino to order Luisi to engage in the
charged drug transactions. Merlino was Luisi's superior in the LCN, and
the government was aware of the serious consequences Luisi would face if
he refused to follow Merlino's order.

The district court instructed the jury on the entrapment defense.
However, the court's supplemental instructions --- given in response to
a jury question --- foreclosed the jury from considering Merlino's role
in the asserted government entrapment of Luisi. We conclude that those
instructions were erroneous, and we vacate the convictions and remand
the case.

I.

In July 1999, a grand jury in the District of Massachusetts indicted
Luisi and three co-defendants on three charges: one count of conspiracy
to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, *see* 21 U.S.C. §§
841(a)(1), 846, and two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute, *see id.* § 841(a). The conspiracy was alleged to have run
from February 1999 through June 28, 1999. The two possession counts
stemmed from transactions on April 30,1999, and June 3,1999.

Pursuant to plea agreements with the government, two of Luisi's
co-defendants pled guilty to the possession counts. The indictment
against the third was dismissed following that defendant's death,
leaving Luisi as the sole defendant at a trial that commenced on
September 9, 2002. We recount the key testimony.

In the late 1990s, the FBI conducted a major investigation into the
operations of the Philadelphia LCN. Previte, a captain or "capo regime"
in the LCN, assisted the FBI investigation by working as a cooperating
witness under a personal services contract with the FBI. He was paid a
substantial sum of money in return.

The FBI came to learn that Luisi was working for the Philadelphia LCN as
a captain, and that he was supervising the criminal activity that the
organization undertook in Boston. Eager to get evidence against Luisi,
the FBI had Previte introduce Luisi to McGowan, who posed as a source of
illegal money-making opportunities.

The introduction took place over January 11th and 12th, 1999. McGowan
operated under the pseudonym "Michael O'Sullivan" and purported to be in
the import/export business. He told Luisi he had previously worked with
Capo Previte in Philadelphia, and said he had now relocated to Boston.
McGowan explained to Luisi that as part of his business he was sometimes
presented with "opportunities" and that sometimes he needed help taking
advantage of these "deals." Luisi agreed that he would look at future
deals with McGowan. Unbeknownst to Luisi, this conversation was being
recorded by the FBI --- as were the vast majority of the future
conversations Luisi would have with McGowan.

The first "opportunity" occurred on February 10, 1999, when McGowan
presented Luisi with several "stolen" furs. Luisi was not sure if he
would be able to sell them, but he stated he would look into it. He also
inquired whether McGowan had other items; when McGowan mentioned the
possibility of obtaining jewelry, Luisi expressed more interest in that,
and particularly in diamonds. There was no mention of any drugs at this
point.

Several days later, Luisi and Previte spoke to each other at a party in
Philadelphia. Merlino was also present at the party. Luisi testified
that Previte proposed a "swap" of cocaine for diamonds, and that Luisi's
response was that he would "try" to get the deal done. He testified that
he gave this response because "at the party \[Merlino\] \... made it
very clear to me that he wanted these drugs," although Luisi later
clarified that he did not at that time understand Merlino to be giving
an "order" to do the deal, but merely "permission." That would change.
In any event, Luisi testified that at or shortly after the party he
chose not to do the deal.

On March 8, 1999, McGowan again met with Luisi, along with two of
Luisi's associates. McGowan referred to Previte's proposed swap and
stated that he (McGowan) knew a guy with diamonds, and that the guy was
looking to exchange them for "three bricks." Luisi's immediate response
was: "I want to get them, I want to bring them to \[a jeweler friend of
mine\], if he likes it, boom. We'll do the deal and I'll do it that way,
whatever \[Previte\] wants." McGowan interpreted this to mean that Luisi
wanted to see the diamonds, and that he would be willing to exchange
cocaine for them.

Several minutes later, however, Luisi took McGowan aside privately. This
part of the conversation was not recorded. According to McGowan, Luisi
told him that because Previte had referred McGowan to him, Luisi would
make "every effort" to get the cocaine, but it would be difficult and it
would take time. Luisi testified that he did not actually agree to do a
drugs-for-diamonds swap.

Also during the March 8th conversation, McGowan asked Luisi what items,
other than the diamonds, he would be interested in. Luisi responded that
he would be interested in jewelry, watches, and cigarettes, and some of
his associates mentioned film and razor blades.

McGowan's next meeting with Luisi and his associates came on March 11,
1999. McGowan had some "stolen" Polaroid film, and the participants
discussed how it was to be sold. Luisi reported on his only partially
successful attempts to sell fur coats, and the participants also
discussed diamonds and jewelry. Later during the meeting, McGowan
mentioned that Previte was coming up to Boston in a few days, and Luisi
agreed to meet with both Previte and McGowan then. Luisi and his
associates left with the film.

Previte came to Boston, and on March 16, 1999, he met with McGowan,
Luisi, and some of Luisi's associates. The participants had a cryptic
conversation during which, according to McGowan, Luisi confirmed that he
would get the eocaine-for-diamonds deal done. The following day, McGowan
talked to Luisi over the phone, and again inquired into the status of
the cocaine deal with Previte. Luisi replied that he would work on it,
but indicated that the deal would not happen immediately-

During this time, Luisi had also been trying to sell the film that
McGowan had given him on March 11th. He was unable to do so at a price
that McGowan was willing to accept, and so on March 19th Luisi returned
the film. After Luisi again expressed his preference for jewelry, and
after McGowan again reaffirmed his ability to get jewelry, the
conversation turned back to the proposed diamonds-for-cocaine deal.
Luisi made comments that, if taken at face value, expressed a reluctance
to go ahead with the deal and indicated that Luisi had "nothing to do
with" the cocaine business. Luisi also explained to McGowan that "in the
last \... three years I lost over a dozen and a half guys to that\....
And I have to make a stern, a firm stand here\.... I don't wanna have
nothing to do with it."

Luisi then said that he would send a guy named Danny White, not
affiliated with Luisi, to do the deal. Luisi told McGowan that once
White made contact with McGowan, McGowan would have exactly seven days
to complete the transaction. Luisi and McGowan also discussed cash terms
for the deal (even though the deal had originally been conceived of as a
barter for diamonds).

Luisi testified that Danny White actually is a fictitious person whom
Luisi made up in order to pretend that he was cooperating with McGowan.
McGowan testified that he never met White at any point, that he never
had any conversation with him, and that he did not know whether White
was a fictitious person or not.

Luisi and McGowan had no contact with each other for the next three
weeks.[^59] On April 19, 1999, McGowan initiated a phone conversation
with Luisi. McGowan turned the discussion to dealings with Previte, and
Luisi responded that "\[ejverything's gonna be okay soon." McGowan
understood this to be a reference to the cocaine transaction.

McGowan initiated another phone conversation with Luisi on April 23,
1999. McGowan told him that Previte would be coming to Boston on April
28th, and he asked Luisi to be available then. Luisi said he would
probably be available, and he also said "Pm ah gonna be calling you ah
with my other friend any day." McGowan interpreted the "other friend" to
be a reference to Danny White. In the same phone conversation, McGowan
mentioned that he might soon have more stolen property coming in.

On April 27, 1999, one day before Prev-ite's planned trip to Boston,
Previte had a conversation with Merlino, his superior in the LCN.
Previte was wearing a wire, and the conversation was recorded. As
revealed by the tape, Previte complained to Merlino that Luisi had not
yet done the cocaine transaction, despite Luisi's representations.
Previte explained to Merlino that he had "big money sittin\[g\] on the
line," and that Merlino would also make money from the transaction. He
directly asked Merlino if there was "any way you could just tell
\[Luisi\] to do what he gotta do." Merlino agreed to do so. Previte and
Merlino then agreed that when Prev-ite went to Boston the next day,
Previte would put Luisi on the phone with Merlino, at which point
Merlino would tell Luisi to do the cocaine deal. As Merlino put it on
the tape: "I'll say \[to Luisi:\] whatever \[Previte\] says to do\[,\]
just do it."

Previte was still cooperating with the FBI at the time he had the
conversation with Merlino, and a jury could conclude that the FBI had in
fact directed Previte's request of Merlino. Previte did not testify, nor
did any of the Philadelphia FBI agents who had worked with him. But
McGowan was asked if the FBI had arranged the meeting between Previte
and Merlino, and his response was that while he did not know, he
"assume\[d\] so because Previte was cooperating."

Previte flew to Boston on the morning of April 28th, the day after his
conversation with Merlino. He went to McGowan's office, and McGowan
arranged for Previte to make a three-way call with LCN boss Merlino and
Capo Luisi, Merlino's underling. The call was recorded in its entirety.
It began with Previte calling Luisi. Once Luisi was on the line, Previte
brought Merlino into the conversation. After an exchange of
preliminaries, Merlino (somewhat cryptically) got down to business.[^60]
Luisi testified that he understood Merlino to be ordering him to get the
cocaine deal done, and that he agreed to do the deal as a result of
this.

McGowan, who had been listening in to the conversation, testified to
having a similar understanding. As he put it, "\[a\]fter this phone
conversation, I expected to receive cocaine." His hopes were soon
realized.

Within an hour after Merlino spoke to Luisi, Luisi met with Previte and
McGowan to confirm details of the drug transaction. Initially, Previte
and Luisi had a private conversation to work out certain points, and
Previte explained that McGowan wanted to do multiple cocaine deals.
Luisi agreed, and the private conversation ended shortly thereafter.
With Luisi looking on, Previte then informed McGowan that the mysterious
Danny White would not be playing a role in the deal, and that his place
would be taken by Shawn Vetere, one of Luisi's associates. Vetere
promptly put McGowan in touch with Bobby Carroz-za.[^61] McGowan worked
out more details with Carrozza. On April 30, 1999 --- two days after the
call with Merlino --- Carrozza sold two kilograms of cocaine to McGowan.
Carrozza told McGowan that the cocaine came "right from \[Luisi and
Vetere\]. I wouldn't be able to do it any other way."

Two weeks later, McGowan gave Luisi a \$1,000 "tribute" payment for
arranging the transaction. McGowan and Luisi also engaged in preliminary
discussions about a future cocaine deal, and Luisi told McGowan to work
the rest out with Carrozza. McGowan did so.

The next cocaine delivery was not immediately forthcoming, however. On
May 24, 1999, McGowan complained to Luisi, who told him to be patient.
On June 1, 1999, Luisi proposed certain changes to the impending cocaine
transaction; McGowan agreed to the revised cocaine deal the next day,
and he paid Luisi the \$24,000 cash price. On June 3, 1999, Carrozza and
Tommy Wilson (another of Luisi's associates) came to McGowan's office to
deliver one kilogram of cocaine. McGowan later gave Luisi a \$500
"tribute" payment for arranging the deal.[^62]

Luisi was the sole witness to testify for the defense. He testified to
several additional pertinent points. He admitted that he had been a
captain in the LCN since the fall of 1998, and he agreed that the LCN
was properly described as "the Mafia" and as "the mob." As a captain,
one of his jobs had been to make "tribute" payments to Merlino, and
these payments had come out of Luisi's earnings from the criminal
enterprises conducted by his "crew" in Boston. Luisi explained that the
LCN was extremely hierarchical, and he stated that when the head of the
LCN ordered him to do the cocaine transaction, he felt that he had no
alternative other than to fulfill the order. He was also asked why he
had engaged in the second cocaine transaction; while he did not
specifically reference Merlino's order, he responded that he had not
wanted to do the drug deal, and he did so because he "had to bring money
to Philadelphia" and so he "was desperate."

Luisi admitted that at one point in his life he had been involved in
drug distribution. However, he testified that he stopped his involvement
in that business when he joined the LCN in mid-1998, and he gave several
reasons for this. At the time Luisi joined, Georgie Borghesi (another
LCN captain) and Merlino both told Luisi that he was not to deal drugs.
Additionally, Luisi testified that around that time he had a "spiritual
encounter," and he realized that his "whole lifestyle was wrong."
Because he was an LCN captain, he found it difficult to realize fully
his spiritual aspirations, but he testified that he was at least
partially able to implement them by ending his involvement with drugs as
of late 1998.[^63]

Luisi also offered an explanation for why he had seemed receptive to the
cocaine deal, even before receiving the order from Merlino on April
28th. He claimed he had been trying to "pal off' McGowan and Previte;
that is, he politely pretended to be cooperating with them on the drug
deal, while in fact he had no intention of ever delivering drugs to
them.

Before the jury was instructed, Luisi's attorney asked the district
court to dismiss the case on the ground that the government had engaged
in allegedly outrageous conduct, thereby violating Luisi's due process
rights. The court never ruled on that motion; such a motion is an issue
for the judge and not the jury. *See United States v. Bradley,* 820 F.2d
3, 7 n. 5 (1st Cir.1987). However, over the government's objection, the
district court did agree that Luisi was entitled to an entrapment
instruction.

The district court's entrapment instructions correctly informed the jury
that the government had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that Luisi had not been entrapped. *See United States v. Walter,* 434
F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2006). The district court further explained that
the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least
one of two things was true: either (1) "no government agent[^64] or
person acting on behalf \[of\] or \... under \[the\] auspices of the
government persuaded or induced the defendant to commit" the charged
crimes; or (2) "the defendant was ready and willing to commit the
\[charged\] crimefs\] without persuasion from the government." This was
also a correct statement of the law. *See United States v. Gamache,* 156
F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998) (explaining that the two prongs of an
entrapment defense are improper government inducement and lack of
predisposition).

Luisi specifically asked for an instruction indicating that if the jury
found that Previte had induced Merlino, that meant that Merlino's order
could be considered government action. The district court refused,
stating that the instruction was improper because there was a factual
dispute over whether the government's responsibility ended due to the
presence of an intermediary.

Shortly after commencing deliberations, the jury sent the court a
question that revealed it was considering Merli-no's role and how it
related to the entrapment defense. The jury asked: "Is Merlino's request
of Luisi, if determined to be excessive pressure, considered to be
government persuasion or inducement because the contact between Merlino
and Luisi resulted from the government agent Previte and Merlino?"

The court and the parties researched the issue overnight, and returned
in the morning to discuss the proper response. Luisi contended that
because Previte had spoken to Merlino about the cocaine transaction, and
because Merlino's order had been facilitated by Previte and McGowan (the
latter of whom had actually placed the three-way call to Merlino), the
actions of Merlino, Previte, and McGowan together could be attributed to
the government. The government disagreed, and based its argument on a
case from outside this circuit, *United States v. Washington,* 106 F.3d
983 (D.C.Cir.1997). The government described Luisi's asserted defense as
"derivative entrapment," and it claimed that *Washington* was the only
case it could find recognizing the defense. As the government read
*Washington,* Luisi's claim was foreclosed on the facts presented.

The court took a different route, and it ultimately concluded that a
case from this circuit, *United States v. Bradley,* was controlling. In
*Bradley* a prison inmate named Constanza, who could have been deemed to
have been acting as a government agent, directly threatened an
intermediary named Brenner to do a drug deal on pain of physical harm.
820 F.2d at 5-6. The intermediary was unable to do the deal on his own,
and he in turn pressured his friend --- the defendant Bradley --- to
assist him. *See id.* at 7-8. We found the evidence sufficient to
support an entrapment instruction for the intermediary Brenner, as the
government agent had directly threatened him. *Id.* But we held that
Brenner's friend, defendant Bradley, was not entitled to an entrapment
instruction: while Brenner could claim duress, Bradley had "only an
appeal to sympathy, which he was free to reject." *Id.* at 7. We stated
that we "would not extend the \[entrapment\] defense to a remote
defendant without, at least, a showing that pressure had been put upon
him by the intermediary at the instruction of the government agent."
*Id.* at 8.

Thus in *Bradley* this court rejected defendant Bradley's argument that
the government's improper inducement of Brenner could be an indirect
entrapment of Bradley, as the agent (Constanza) had neither ordered nor
expected Brenner to entrap other persons. *See id.* at 7. We said that a
"quite different case would be presented if Constanza had targeted a
putative seller and had instructed Brenner to put the arm on him." *Id.*
We then added a footnote to "suggest that such a case, though argued to
be a third-party case, is not really a third-party case at all. The
intermediary in such instance is really acting under instructions, as a
government subagent --- a quite different situation." *Id.* at 7 n. 6.

The district court focused upon *Bradley's* use of the word
"instructions," and it read that case as concerned with whether the
government agent (Previte) had "instructed" the intermediary (Merlino)
to pressure Luisi. The court concluded that because Previte ranked below
Merlino in the LCN hierarchy, Previte was in no position to "instruct"
Merlino to do anything.

Although Luisi argued for a broader reading of the word "instruct," the
district court rejected such a reading of *Bradley.* In the alternative,
Luisi asked that the jury be allowed to determine whether Merlino had
been "instructed," but the court rejected that option as well.

The district court then called the jury back into the courtroom and
answered the jury's question as follows:

> \[I\]n your consideration of the entrapment question, you should focus
> your attention on the relationship --- the direct relationship between
> Mr. Previte \... and Mr. McGowan on the one hand, and Mr. Luisi on the
> other hand. You should consider evidence as \[it\] relates to the
> direct contact between and among those people.

Because the district court omitted Merlino from this statement, while
simultaneously mentioning other individuals, the jury likely concluded
that it could not consider Merlino's role in any inducement of Luisi.
This was particularly so since the jury's question specifically asked
about Merlino, and the court told the jury to focus on individuals other
than Merlino. As a result, and as the government has not disputed, the
jury was precluded from finding that Merlino's order to Luisi could be
deemed improper governmental inducement.

Later that day, the jury convicted Luisi on all three counts of the
indictment.

II\.

Luisi's primary contention on appeal is that the district court's jury
instructions, as supplemented by its answer to the jury's question, were
incorrect as a matter of law. We review that issue de novo here. *See
United States v. Buttrick,* 432 F.3d 373, 376 (1st Cir.2005).

We agree with Luisi that the district court's instructions were
erroneous. We begin by explaining the nature and policies behind the
entrapment defense generally. We address *Bradley,* and conclude that it
supports Luisi's claim of error. We also reject the government's
alternative argument, which we review de novo, that there was no
reversible error on the facts presented because Luisi was not entitled
to any entrapment instruction whatsoever. *See United States v.
Nishnianidze,* 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that a defendant
is entitled to a jury instruction so long as his legal theory is valid
and there is evidence in the record to support it).

A. *Understanding the Entrapment Defense*

In federal criminal cases, the entrapment defense is neither a doctrine
of constitutional dimension, nor a defense specifically granted by
statute. *See United States v. Russell,* 411 U.S. 423, 432-33, 93 S.Ct.
1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). Rather, the defense has its origins in an
inference about congressional intent. *Sherman v. United States,* 356
U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958); *see also United
States v. Gendron,* 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir.1994). The Supreme Court
has explained that the "function of law enforcement is the prevention of
crime and the apprehension of criminals. Manifestly, that function does
not include the manufacturing of crime\.... Congress could not have
intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent
persons into violations." *Sherman,* 356 U.S. at 372, 78 S.Ct. 819. A
successful entrapment defense requires that there be a reasonable doubt
on both prongs of a two-pronged test.

The first prong necessitates a showing of improper government
inducement. *See Gamache,* 156 F.3d at 9. This aspect of the defense
plainly seeks to deter improper government conduct. *Gendron,* 18 F.3d
at 961. Indeed, a defendant cannot claim entrapment when government
conduct played no causal role in the defendant's inducement. *See
Sherman,* 356 U.S. at 372, 78 S.Ct. 819. Nevertheless, the entrapment
defense only deters government misbehavior in cases where the defendant
would otherwise be law-abiding. *Gendron,* 18 F.3d at 962. That is
because the second prong requires that the defendant have a lack of
predisposition to commit the charged offense. *See id.; see also
Sorrells v. United States,* 287 U.S. 435, 448, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed.
413 (1932).

These two prongs, and the policy concerns behind them, play important
roles in delimiting the scope of the entrapment defense. But they are
not the only considerations that matter. This court and the Supreme
Court have taken account of the practical problems facing law
enforcement, particularly in the prosecution of "victimless" crimes
where "significant governmental involvement in illegal activities" is
often required. *Bradley,* 820 F.2d at 6-8; *see also Hampton v. United
States,* 425 U.S. 484, 494-95 & n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113
(1976) (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment); *Russell,* 411 U.S. at
432, 93 S.Ct. 1637; *Gendron,* 18 F.3d at 961. We must be mindful that
"the defense of entrapment \... \[does\] not \... give the federal
judiciary a 'chancellor's foot' veto over law enforcement practices of
which it \[does\] not approve." *Russell,* 411 U.S. at 435, 93 S.Ct.
1637.

These various considerations are sometimes in tension with one another,
and we have treated the resolution of questions about the scope of the
entrapment defense as essentially exercises in balancing. Indeed, in
*Bradley* we weighed the competing factors and realized that we
ultimately faced "a question of social policy." 820 F.2d at 8; *cf.
United States v. Hollingsworth,* 27 F.3d 1196, 1198 (7th Cir.1994) (en
banc) (characterizing entrapment as a "common law doctrine").

We synthesize the key facts on which we must balance competing concerns
in this case. It is beyond dispute that an individual like Previte,
hired by the government as an informant, is a "government agent" for
entrapment purposes. *See Sherman,* 356 U.S. at 373-75, 78 S.Ct. 819.
Nor can there be any dispute that Merlino's order to Luisi, with its
implied threat of physical harm or other serious retribution, could be
found by a jury to be improper inducement *if attributed to the
government. See Gendron,* 18 F.3d at 961; *Bradley,* 820 F.2d at 7.

It is also clear that Luisi's case does not fit the pattern of what has
come to be known as "vicarious entrapment." In "vicarious entrapment" an
unknowing middleman merely tells the defendant about an inducement that
the government had used to target the middleman. *See United States v.
Valencia,* 645 F.2d 1158, 1168-69 (2d Cir.1980) (recognizing the
vicarious entrapment defense). Here, the target was not the middleman
Merlino, but the defendant Luisi. Further, a jury could find that
Merlino had himself threatened Luisi. This was not a case where Merlino
repeated to Luisi a threat that Previte had made against Merlino.
Indeed, Previte did not threaten Merlino at all.

Instead, this case is much closer to what has been called "derivative
entrapment," a situation in which a government agent "uses the
unsuspecting middleman as a means of passing on an inducement" to the
defendant. 2 W. LaFave, *Substantive Criminal Law,* § 9.8(a), at 93 (2d
ed.2003).[^65] Yet even within this category, further refinement is
required.

We have before us a situation in which a jury could find that Previte
specifically targeted Luisi, and then "induced" Merlino to give an order
to Luisi when Merlino might not have otherwise done so. But Previte's
inducement of *Merlino* does not appear to have itself been improper.
Previte simply helped set up a drug transaction, explained to Merlino
that Merlino would profit from the transaction's execution, and then
encouraged Merlino to order Luisi's assistance. *Cf. Gendron,* 18 F.3d
at 961-62 (explaining that improper inducement "goes beyond providing an
ordinary 'opportunity to commit a crime,' " and providing examples
(quoting *Jacobson v. United States,* 503 U.S. 540, 550, 112 S.Ct. 1535,
118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992))). A jury would presumably find that Previte
merely provided an "ordinary" inducement to Merlino; it was Merlino's
inducement of Luisi that a jury could find improper.

This is an unusual entrapment situation. Under the original, correct
instructions given, it is evident that the jury was considering the
possibility that Merlino had put excessive pressure on Luisi, and that
the jurors were unsure whether Merlino's order could be considered
"government persuasion or inducement because the contact between Merlino
and Luisi resulted from the government agent Previte." The effect of the
court's response was the same as if it had instructed the jury, as a
matter of law, that Merlino's order could not be considered *government*
inducement or persuasion. We must decide whether the issue was correctly
removed from the jury's consideration.

B. *Thirdr-Party Entrapment After Bradley*

In this circuit, *Bradley* is the leading case on third-party
entrapment. Like the district court, the government now believes that
*Bradley* controls this case. We examine *Bradley's* facts and reasoning
in greater detail.

The government agent in *Bradley* was a prison inmate named Constanza.
In exchange for a reduced sentence, Constanza agreed to identify drug
dealers for the government to assist in undercover operations and
prosecutions. *See Bradley,* 820 F.2d at 5. Constanza told the
government about an individual named Brenner, and then he threatened
Brenner with physical harm if Brenner did not engage in a cocaine deal
with an undercover agent. *Id.* at 5. Brenner in turn appealed to his
friend, defendant Bradley, for assistance in obtaining the cocaine.
*Id.* at 6. Though Bradley initially refused, Brenner explained that his
physical safety was in jeopardy. *Id.* Upon hearing this, Bradley
decided to assist Brenner. *Id.*

It should now be clear that *Bradley* presented a narrow fact pattern:
it was a case of vicarious entrapment. That is, Brenner merely informed
Bradley of a threat that had been made against Brenner, not one that had
been made against Bradley. Although the Second Circuit's *Valencia*
opinion had recognized that such a vicarious entrapment defense could be
viable, we considered and rejected that position. *See id.* at 8. At the
same time, however, we rejected the government's argument that a
defendant can never be entrapped by a third party. *See id.* at 6-8.

*Bradley* reached these conclusions by weighing a variety of policy
considerations as applied to the facts of the case. On the one hand was
the fact that the crime would not have happened but for the government's
involvement. *See id.* at 6. On the other hand were several factors.
First, the government's role in ensnaring Bradley was "attenuated"
because the agent's threat neither ordered Brenner to seek assistance
*nor expected it. Id.* at 7. Second, *Bradley* acknowledged the
practical difficulties for the prosecution when it is forced to refute a
defendant's claim of entrapment in a scenario where the only two
witnesses --- the defendant and the intermediary --- are likely to be
hostile to the government. *See id.* Third, *Bradley* observed that the
defendant did commit a crime, exhibiting socially inappropriate
behavior. *See id.* at 6. Finally, *Bradley* noted the fact that
undercover investigations are often needed to prosecute drug crimes.
*See id.*

The *Bradley* court ultimately held that it "would not extend the
\[entrapment\] defense to a remote defendant without, at least, a
showing that pressure had been put upon him by the intermediary at the
instruction of the government agent." *Id.* at 8. The government reads
"instruct" to mean "command," such that Previte is not responsible for
Merlino's threats against Luisi unless Previte had commanded Mer-lino to
order Luisi into the cocaine deal. Luisi reads "instruct" to mean
"convince" or "inform." But the dispute about the use of particular
language in *Bradley* is largely beside the point. *Bradley* was a case
in which the government agent neither "commanded," "convinced," nor
"informed" the middleman (Brenner) to target Bradley. Indeed, it was the
lack of any government targeting of Bradley *whatsoever* on which
*Bradley* relied. *See id.* at 7. Here, unlike in *Bradley,* the
government's actions were specifically designed to pressure Luisi, and
the government in fact expected that Luisi would be pressured. *Bradley*
thus had no occasion to consider the fact pattern at hand.[^66]

In *United States v. Rogers,* 102 F.3d 641 (1st Cir.1996), we considered
a fact pattern that was more on point. In *Rogers,* the defendant did
not move quickly to complete a drug transaction that an undercover agent
had attempted to facilitate. *Id.* at 645. In an isolated statement, the
government agent "told" the middleman to "put some heat on \[the
defendant\]." *Id.* The agent had thus specifically targeted the
defendant to receive an inducement, and *Rogers* relied on *Bradley* to
conclude that the government would have been responsible if the agent
had "told" the middleman "to apply the pressure or inducement *later
deemed improper." Id.* (emphasis added) (italics removed). However,
*Rogers* factually did not involve an agent's suggestion that *improper*
pressure be applied to the defendant because "putting on some heat" was
not improper. *Rogers* distinguished the more sinister suggestion of
putting "the arm" on someone, a phrase that implied threatened force.
*Id.* at 645-46.

Thus after *Rogers,* the law in this circuit permits an entrapment
instruction involving a middleman when there is evidence that (1) a
government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce
him to commit illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted through the middleman
after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed;
(3) the government agent requested, encouraged, or instructed the
middleman to employ a specified inducement, which could be found
improper, against the targeted defendant; (4) the agent's actions led
the middleman to do what the government sought, even if the government
did not use improper means to influence the middleman; and (5) as a
result of the middleman's inducement, the targeted defendant in fact
engaged in the illegal conduct.[^67]

The government reads *Rogers* differently. It contends that the word
"told" in *Rogers* must mean an imperative equivalent to the
government's interpretation of "instruct" in *Bradley.* It also reads
*Rogers* to state a requirement that the agent have *improperly* induced
the middleman.

We disagree. First, we think that the government's argument is contrary
to the plain meaning of "told," and we see nothing in the context of
*Rogers* that overrides this. Indeed, in concluding that the agent had
not "told" the middleman to improperly induce the defendant, *Rogers*
pointed out that "nothing in the record show\[ed\] that \[the agent\]
*urged, suggested* or was even aware of' the middleman's improper
inducement. *See* 102 F.3d at 645 (emphases added). Urging and
suggesting are hardly equivalent to ordering, nor do they by themselves
necessarily constitute improper inducement. Second, if the *Rogers*
court had in fact read *Bradley* the same way as the government does, we
do not see how the *Rogers* court could have considered it an open
question whether the government can be responsible for an agent's mere
knowing tolerance of improper inducement by a middleman.[^68] *See id.*

Moreover, the policy concerns discussed in *Bradley* support our reading
of *Rogers. Bradley* thought it important that the government's role was
"attenuated" in that case because the agent had not attempted to ensnare
the defendant. *Bradley,* 820 F.2d at 7. But in a case where the
government agent specifically targets the defendant, and then causes the
middleman to take a specifically contemplated action (that is arguably
improper pressure) with the goal of ensnaring the defendant, the
government's role is hardly attenuated. Additionally, *Bradley* worried
about the fact that the government had turned a potentially innocent
person into a criminal, *see id.* at 6, though it ultimately decided
that this concern was outweighed by other issues. But in *Bradley* the
government had never attempted to induce defendant Bradley directly.
*Bradley's* concern for potential innocents weighs heavier when the
government has tried --- and failed --- to induce the defendant without
the use of a middleman.

In light of our understanding of the law, we think a properly instructed
jury could conclude that the government was responsible for Merlino's
order to Luisi. Indeed, such a jury could decide that: (1) Previte
specifically requested that Merlino order Luisi to engage in the cocaine
deal; (2) Previte's request came after earlier government efforts to
ensnare Luisi, without a middleman, had not been fruitful; (3) Previte,
as an LCN captain, understood that the order he requested from Merlino
would contain an implied threat of death, physical harm, or serious
retribution if Luisi failed to comply; (4) Merlino's order to Luisi was
exactly what Previte had requested; and (5) Merlino would not have given
the order if Previte had not encouraged him to do so.[^69] As a result,
we think that the district court incorrectly answered the jury's
question.

This result is supported by a Fifth Circuit case. In *United States v.
Anderton,* 629 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir.1980), the Fifth Circuit allowed the
entrapment defense in a case where law enforcement officers specifically
targeted the defendant, and then put unspecified "pressure" on the
unwitting middleman to bring the defendant into a pre-designed criminal
scheme. *Id.* at 1045, 1047. Without discussing whether the middleman
had been improperly induced, the court found it important that the
criminal design originated from the government itself. *See id.* at
1046-47.

Our conclusion is also supported by the D.C. Circuit's analysis in
*Washington.* In *Washington,* an undercover FBI agent posed as a drug
lord and recruited a corrupt police officer to help him. *See* 106 F.3d
at 990-91. After paying the officer for his services, the agent "asked
\[the officer\] \... to recruit as many new officers as he could." *Id.*
at 991. The corrupt officer agreed, *see id.,* but then recruited the
defendants with an inducement not contemplated by the undercover agent.
*See id.* at 992, 994-95. The *Washington* court rejected the derivative
entrapment instruction on the facts of the case. *Id.* at 995.
Importantly, however, it held that the entrapment defense is available
where the government does contemplate the improper inducement given to
the defendant, and causes the middleman to give that inducement as a
result of a government agent's " 'instruction or direction.' " *Id.* at
993 (quoting *United States v. Layeni,* 90 F.3d 514, 520
(D.C.Cir.1996)); *see also id.* at 995.[^70]

The government cites to other cases, but none presented the fact pattern
at issue here. *See, e.g., Hollingsworth,* 27 F.3d at 1200-02, 1204-05;
*United States v. Hodges,* 936 F.2d 371, 371-72 (8th Cir.1991); *United
States v. Pilarinos,* 864 F.2d 253, 254-56 (2d Cir.1988).[^71] The
Seventh Circuit has even intimated that the defense might be available
when a government agent specifically targets the defendant, and then
encourages the middleman to induce that Zdefendant. *See Hollingsworth,*
27 F.3d at 1204 (citing, inter alia, *Bradley).*

Thus we conclude that the district court erred in answering the jury's
question in a way that excluded Merlino's order from the jury's
consideration. We do not suggest that a jury would necessarily have
concluded that Luisi was entrapped through Merlino. We hold only that
the defendant was entitled to have a properly instructed jury consider
the issue.

C. *Predisposition*

As a fallback argument, the government contends that Luisi failed to
present sufficient evidence of his lack of predisposition, and thus was
not entitled to any entrapment instruction at all. We readily dispose of
this argument.

A judge may only instruct the jury on entrapment if the defendant meets
his entry-level burden of production. *United States v. Gifford,* 17
F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994). That is, a defendant is entitled to an
entrapment instruction only if there is "some evidence," on both
elements of the entrapment defense, sufficient to raise a reasonable
doubt that the defendant was merely an unwary innocent. *See United
States v. Joost,* 92 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1996). The defendant must show
"more than a scintilla of evidence, more than mere creation of an
opportunity for criminal activity." *Id.* Nonetheless, even a
defendant's self-serving testimony can suffice, especially when it has
some circumstantial corroboration. *See id.*

Luisi made the requisite entry-level showing. We have already explained
why a jury could find improper governmental inducement. Additionally,
Luisi introduced "some evidence" of his lack of predisposition. He
testified that sometime before he met McGowan, he experienced a
"spiritual encounter," and that as a result of this spiritual encounter
he resolved to stop dealing drugs. This story was consistent with
evidence that Luisi had deliberately stalled the drug transaction for
several months to "pal off' McGowan, thereby indefinitely delaying a
drug deal to which Luisi was opposed. Indeed, a jury could find that
this *two-month* delay stood in stark contrast to the *two-day* lag
between when Merlino gave Luisi the order, and when McGowan received
drugs from Lui-si's colleagues.

The government suggests that Luisi's "spiritual encounter" was not
credible, and that there was "overwhelming" evidence of Luisi's
predisposition, including the fact that he previously had been a cocaine
dealer, and the fact that Luisi continued to receive profits from small
drug deals undertaken by one of his associates.

In this procedural posture, however, our job is not "to weigh the
evidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the
proof." *Gamache,* 156 F.3d at 9. Accordingly, we find that Luisi
introduced sufficient evidence of his lack of predisposition to entitle
him to an entrapment instruction.

III\.

Luisi further argues that the charges against him in fact should have
been dismissed because the government engaged in outrageous conduct that
violated his due process rights. Outrageous government conduct is an
issue of law, and it is the province of the district court---and not the
jury---to rule on a defendant's motion to dismiss on that ground. *See
Bradley,* 820 F.2d at 7 n. 5. When a district court rules on such a
motion, its ultimate conclusion is subject to de novo review, while its
factual findings are reviewed for clear error. *See United States v.
Guzman,* 282 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.2002).

In this case, the district court never ruled on Luisi's motion, and thus
we have no factual findings in the record to assist us.[^72]
Nonetheless, we think that the basic facts needed to rule on this matter
are clear enough, and that we are able to reach the necessary legal
conclusions. Luisi has asked us to find that the government's conduct
was outrageous, and the government has also asked us to resolve the
issue.

The outrageousness doctrine permits dismissal of criminal charges only
in those very rare instances when the government's misconduct is so
appalling and egregious as to violate due process by "shocking \... the
universal sense of justice." *Russell,* 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637
(quoting *Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton,* 361 U.S. 234,
246, 80 S.Ct. 297, 4 L.Ed.2d 268 (1960))(internal quotation marks
omitted); *see also United States v. Nunez,* 146 F.3d 36, 38 (1st
Cir.1998). While the doctrine is often invoked by criminal defendants,
it has never yet been successful in this circuit. *See United States v.
Santana,* 6 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting First Circuit cases
rejecting the argument); *United States v. Panitz,* 907 F.2d 1267,
1272-73 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting additional First Circuit cases
rejecting the argument); *see also, e.g., United States v. Capelton,*
350 F.3d 231, 243 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003) (rejecting the argument on the
facts presented); *Nunez,* 146 F.3d at 38-39 (same); *United States v.
Matiz,* 14 F.3d 79, 82-83 (1st Cir.1994) (same). This case is no
exception.[^73]

Luisi's argument for dismissal of the charges relies heavily on dicta in
*Bradley* that "outrageous conduct \... might well be found in a threat
of serious physical harm." 820 F.2d at 7. But at the same time,
*Bradley* acknowledged that an outrageousness claim might be defeated if
a defendant has been "too active himself." *Id.* Moreover, defendant
Bradley himself had not been threatened, and we declined to consider the
matter further. *See id.*

Whatever fact situation *Bradley* had in mind, it was not this one.
Here, even though the government's actions have risked giving the
defendant a viable entrapment claim, it is another thing entirely to say
that the conduct was "outrageous." After considering the totality of the
circumstances in this case, we think the government's actions fell well
short of shocking the "universal sense of justice."

IV\.

The judgments of conviction are *vacated* and the case is *remanded* for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[^74]

    the State had the burden to prove an absence of justification beyond
    a reasonable doubt were proper. *See also State v. Gratzer* (1984),

    "not required to prove the nonexistence of every fact which it is

[^3]: **^2^** As the defendant recognizes, the judge correctly
    instructed that "deliberate premeditation excludes action which is
    taken so quickly that there is no time to reflect on the action and
    then decide to do it. The Commonwealth must show that the

    submitted to the jury, "the motion may be renewed within five days
    after the jury is discharged and may include in the alternative a

    that "the judge may on a renewed motion for a directed verdict of
    not guilty pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure
    set aside the verdict and order a new trial, or order the entry of a
    finding of guilty of any offense included in the offense charged in

    > \"A person*'acts knowingly',* or with knowledge,
    >
    > \(1\) With respect to his conduct or to attendant circumstances
    > when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that those
    > circumstances exist; or
    >
    > \(2\) With respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware
    > that his conduct is practically certain to cause that result."
    > (Emphasis original).

[^6]: **^5^** Under the Model Penal Code and our Criminal Code, "\[a\]
    person *\'acts recklessly'* \... when he consciously disregards a
    substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that
    a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes a gross
    deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would
    exercise in the situation." (Emphasis original). § 562.-016.4.

[^7]: **^6^** The additional or expanded definition of \"knowingly"
    proposed in § 2.02(7) of the Model Penal Code

    > \"deals with the situation British commentators have denominated
    > 'wilful blindness' or 'connivance,' the case of the actor who is
    > aware of the probable existence of a material fact but does not
    > satisfy himself that it does not in fact exist\.... Whether such
    > cases should be viewed as instances of acting recklessly or
    > knowingly presents a subtle but important question.
    >
    > The draft proposes that the case be viewed as one of acting

    > not when what is involved is the result of the defendant's
    > conduct, necessarily a matter of the future at the time of acting.
    > The position reflects what we believe to be the normal policy of
    > criminal enactments which rest liability on acting 'knowingly,' as
    > is so commonly done. The inference of 'knowledge' of an existing
    > fact is usually drawn from proof of notice of substantial
    > probability of its existence, unless the defendant establishes an
    > honest, contrary belief. The draft solidifies this usual result
    > and clarifies the terms in which the issue is submitted to the
    > jury." Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) commentary at 129-30 (Tent.
    > Draft No. 4, 1953).

[^8]: **^7^** This inference is reinforced by looking to other statutes
    found in our Criminal Code which acknowledge the problem of defining
    \"knowingly" with respect to age. *See, e.g.,* § 566.020.

[^9]: **^8^** This distillation of the child's testimony is the most
    favorable to the state. The child's testimony was inconsistent, and
    this inconsistency was not lessened by the prosecutor attempting to
    use prior testimony of the child --- at best, impeaching testimony
    --- as substantive testimony.

[^10]: **^9^** Admittedly, a person in defendant's shoes can easily
    avoid conviction of a crime under § 568.-050 by simply refusing to
    check the age of "dancers\". This result is to be rectified,
    however, by the legislature, not by judicial redefinition of already
    precisely defined statutory language or by improper inferences from
    operative facts.

    The Model Penal Code's expanded definition of "knowingly" attracts
    us by its logic. Apparently, it was not as attractive to our
    legislature for use throughout our Criminal Code.

    Other states protect their minor children by the simple device of
    removing the requirement of \"knowledge" of the child's age as an
    element of the offense. Thus, the New York Penal Code provides:

    > \"Notwithstanding the use of the term 'knowingly' in any provision
    > of this chapter defining an offense in which the age of a child is
    > an element thereof, knowledge by the defendant of the age of such
    > child is not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless
    > expressly so provided, a defense to a prosecution therefor that
    > the defendant did not know the age of the child or believed such
    > age to be the same as or greater than that specified in the
    > statute." N.Y.Penal Law, § 15.20.3 (McKinney 1975).

     

     

     

[^11]: **^2^** In fact, Garner, an eighth-grader, was 15. He was 5\' 4\"
    tall and weighed somewhere around 100 or 110 pounds. App. to Pet.
    for Cert. A5.

[^12]: **^11^** The roots of the concept of a "felony" lie not in
    capital punishment but in forfeiture. 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland,
    The History of English Law 465 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Pollock &
    Maitland). Not all felonies were always punishable by death.
    See*id.,* at 466-467, n. 3. Nonetheless, the link was profound.
    Blackstone was able to write: "The idea of felony is indeed so
    generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it
    hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the
    law do now conform. And therefore if a statute makes any new offence
    felony, the law implies that is shall be punished with death, *viz.*
    by hanging, as well as with forfeiture . . . ." 4 W. Blackstone,
    Commentaries \*98. See also R. Perkins & R. Boyce, Criminal Law
    14-15 (3d ed. 1982); 2 Pollock & Maitland 511.

[^13]: **^1^** The defendant has not challenged on any basis his
    conviction of unlawfully possessing a firearm, and accordingly we do
    not review that conviction. See*Commonwealth* v. *Williams,* 422
    Mass. 111, 112 n.1 (1996). See also Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as
    amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975) ("The appellate court need not pass
    upon questions or issues not argued in the brief").

[^14]: **^1^** The owner of the house testified that no lights were on
    in the house, but that a back door light was on. Record 160. Officer
    Hymon, though uncertain, stated in his deposition that there were
    lights on in the house.*Id.,* at 209.

[^15]: **^2^** In closing argument, the prosecutor asserted:

    > What happened in this case is that there was a drug debt. The
    > \[Appellant\] owed these guys money, as happens all the time, and
    > these guys wanted to collect their money, and the debt became due
    > on March 1st of 1990.
    >
    > And on March 1st of 1990, in collection of that debt, they grabbed
    > him off the streets, whether there was a machine gun or a handgun,
    > we don\'t know, but I am convinced he probably was taken off the
    > streets, and he was told the debt is due.

    The trial judge apparently agreed. Even if the judge's conclusion
    was incorrect, that payment of the debt motivated the abduction, the
    evidence was still sufficient to establish that the abductors were
    seeking drugs and money and that appellant was willing to "assist in
    the commission of an armed robbery \... if that \[appeased them\]
    and \[he\] was safe."

[^16]: **^3^** When asked at trial why he fired, Hymon stated:

    > "Well, first of all it was apparent to me from the little bit that
    > I knew about the area at the time that he was going to get away
    > because, number 1, I couldn't get to him. My partner then couldn't
    > find where he was because, you know, he was late coming around. He
    > didn't know where I was talking about. I couldn't get to him
    > because of the fence here, I couldn't have jumped this fence and
    > come up, consequently jumped this fence and caught him before he
    > got away because he was already up on the fence, just one leap and
    > he was already over the fence, and so there is no way that I could
    > have caught him." App. 52.

    He also stated that the area beyond the fence was dark, that he
    could not have gotten over the fence easily because he was carrying
    a lot of equipment and wearing heavy boots, and that Garner, being
    younger and more energetic, could have outrun him.*Id.,* at 53-54.

[^17]: **^4^** The defendant insists that he did not shoot the victim
    but recognizes that the evidence warranted a jury finding to that
    effect.

[^18]: **^5^** The defendant refers passingly to additional challenges
    to the integrity of the grand jury that he made in the trial court,
    including that the grand jury heard only hearsay testimony and that
    the prosecutor did not present evidence that exculpated the
    defendant. He makes no argument on appeal with respect to those
    claims and they are waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4).

     

     

     

[^19]: **^1^** The State agrees that the docket entries should be
    amended. Accordingly, it will be so ordered.

[^20]: **^2^** There is no federal statute defining the elements of the
    duress defense. We have not specified the elements of the defense,
    see, *e. g., United States* v. *Bailey,* 444 U. S. 394, 409-410
    (1980), and need not do so today. Instead, we presume the accuracy
    of the District Court's description of these elements: (1) The
    defendant was under an unlawful and imminent threat of such a nature
    as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily
    injury; (2) the defendant had not recklessly or negligently placed
    herself in a situation in which it was probable that she would be
    forced to perform the criminal conduct; (3) the defendant had no
    reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law, that is, a
    chance both to refuse to perform the criminal act and also to avoid
    the threatened harm; and, (4) that a direct causal relationship may
    be reasonably anticipated between the criminal act and the avoidance
    of the threatened harm. See App. 312-313; see generally *United
    States* v. *Harper,* 802 F. 2d 115, 118 (CA5 1986).

[^21]: **^3^** The Pennsylvania statute defined the duress defense, and
    the exception thereto, as follows:

    § 309 Duress

    > \(a\) General Rule.---It is a defense that the actor engaged in
    > the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was
    > coerced to do so by the use of, or threat to use, unlawful force
    > against his person or the person of another, which a person of
    > reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to
    > resist.
    >
    > \(b\) Exception.---The defense provided by subsection (a) of this
    > section is unavailable if the actor recklessly placed himself in a
    > situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to
    > duress. The defense is also unavailable if he was negligent in
    > placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence suffices
    > to establish culpability to the offense charged.

    *Knight,611 A.2d* at 1202-03.

[^22]: **^4^** Garner had rummaged through one room in the house, in
    which, in the words of the owner, "\[a\]ll the stuff was out on the
    floors, all the drawers was pulled out, and stuff was scattered all
    over."*Id.,* at 34. The owner testified that his valuables were
    untouched but that, in addition to the purse and the 10 dollars, one
    of his wife's rings was missing. The ring was not recovered. *Id.,*
    at 34-35.

[^23]: **^5^** Although the statute does not say so explicitly,
    Tennessee law forbids the use of deadly force in the arrest of a
    misdemeanant. See*Johnson* v. *State,* 173 Tenn. 134, 114 S. W. 2d
    819 (1938).

[^24]: **^6^** "The right of the people to be secure in their persons .
    . . against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
    violated . . . ." U. S. Const., Arndt. 4.

[^25]: **^7^** The Court of Appeals concluded that the rule set out in
    the Model Penal Code "accurately states Fourth Amendment limitations
    on the use of deadly force against fleeing felons." 710 F. 2d, at
    247. The relevant portion of the Model Penal Code provides:

    > "The use of deadly force is not justifiable . . . unless (i) the
    > arrest is for a felony; and (ii) the person effecting the arrest
    > is authorized to act as a peace officer or is assisting a person
    > whom he believes to be authorized to act as a peace officer; and
    > (iii) the actor believes that the force employed creates no
    > substantial risk of injury to innocent persons; and (iv) the actor
    > believes that (1) the crime for which the arrest is made involved
    > conduct including the use or threatened use of deadly force; or
    > (2) there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested
    > will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is
    > delayed." American Law Institute, Model Penal Code §3.07(2)(b)
    > (Proposed Official Draft 1962).

    The court also found that "\[a\]n analysis of the facts of this case
    under the Due Process Clause" required the same result, because the
    statute was not narrowly drawn to further a compelling state
    interest. 710 F. 2d, at 246-247. The court considered the
    generalized interest in effective law enforcement sufficiently
    compelling only when the the suspect is dangerous. Finally, the
    court held, relying on*Owen* v. *City of Independence,* 445 U. S.
    622 (1980), that the city was not immune.

[^26]: **^8^** The dissent emphasizes that subsequent investigation
    cannot replace immediate apprehension. We recognize that this is so,
    see n. 13,*infra;* indeed, that is the reason why there is any
    dispute. If subsequent arrest were assured, no one would argue that
    use of deadly force was justified. Thus, we proceed on the
    assumption that subsequent arrest is not likely. Nonetheless, it
    should be remembered that failure to apprehend at the scene does not
    necessarily mean that the suspect will never be caught.

    In lamenting the inadequacy of later investigation, the dissent
    relies on the report of the President's Commission on Law
    Enforcement and Administration of Justice. It is worth noting that,
    notwithstanding its awareness of this problem, the Commission itself
    proposed a policy for use of deadly force arguably even more
    stringent than the formulation we adopt today. See President's
    Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task
    Force Report: The Police 189 (1967). The Commission proposed that
    deadly force be used only to apprehend "perpetrators who, in the
    course of their crime threatened the use of deadly force, or if the
    officer believes there is a substantial risk that the person whose
    arrest is sought will cause death or serious bodily harm if his
    apprehension is delayed." In addition, the officer would have "to
    know, as a virtual certainty, that the suspect committed an offense
    for which the use of deadly force is permissible."*Ibid.*

[^27]: **^9^** We note that the usual manner of deterring illegal
    conduct --- through punishment --- has been largely ignored in
    connection with flight from arrest. Arkansas, for example,
    specifically excepts flight from arrest from the offense of
    "obstruction of governmental operations." The commentary notes that
    this "reflects the basic policy judgment that, absent the use of
    force or violence, a mere attempt to avoid apprehension by a law
    enforcement officer does not give rise to an independent offense."
    Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-2802(3)(a) (1977) and commentary. In the few
    States that do outlaw flight from an arresting officer, the crime is
    only a misdemeanor. See,*e.* g., Ind. Code § 35-44-3-3 (1982). Even
    forceful resistance, though generally a separate offense, is
    classified as a misdemeanor. *E. g.,* Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, ¶31-1
    (1984); Mont. Code Ann. §45-7-301 (1984); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann.
    §642:2 (Supp. 1983); Ore. Rev. Stat. §162.315 (1983).

    This lenient approach does avoid the anomaly of automatically
    transforming every fleeing misdemeanant into a fleeing felon ---
    subject, under the common-law rule, to apprehension by deadly force
    --- solely by virtue of his flight. However, it is in real tension
    with the harsh consequences of flight in cases where deadly force is
    employed. For example, Tennessee does not outlaw fleeing from
    arrest. The Memphis City Code does, §22-34.1 (Supp. 17, 1971),
    subjecting the offender to a maximum fine of \$50, § 1-8 (1967).
    Thus, Garner's attempted escape subjected him to (a) a \$50 fine,
    and (b) being shot.

    York City Police Department). See generally Brief for Police
    Foundation et al. as*Amici Curiae.*

[^29]: **^11^** The case at hand does not present that concern. There is
    a tape recording of the conversation in which the middleman
    pressured Luisi. Moreover, the government agent (Previte) in fact
    participated in that conversa-lion, while another government agent
    (McGowan) listened in. Consequently, the government faced fewer
    practical difficulties in refuting Luisi\'s entrapment claim.

[^30]: **^12^** White-collar crime, for example, poses a less
    significant physical threat than, say, drunken driving. See*Welsh*

[^31]: **^13^** It has been argued that sophisticated techniques of
    apprehension and increased communication between the police in
    different jurisdictions have made it more likely that an escapee
    will be caught than was once the case, and that this change has also
    reduced the "reasonableness" of the use of deadly force to prevent
    escape.*E. g.,* Sherman, Execution Without Trial: Police Homicide
    and the Constitution, 33 Vand. L. Rev. 71, 76 (1980). We are unaware
    of any data that would permit sensible evaluation of this claim.
    Current arrest rates are sufficiently low, however, that we have
    some doubt whether in past centuries the failure to arrest at the
    scene meant that the police had missed their only chance in a way
    that is not presently the case. In 1983, 21% of the offenses in the
    Federal Bureau of Investigation crime index were cleared by arrest.
    Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports, Crime in the
    United States 159 (1984). The clearance rate for burglary was 15%.

[^33]: **^15^** In California, the police may use deadly force to arrest
    only if the crime for which the arrest is sought was "a forcible and

    will cause death or serious bodily harm if apprehension is

    Alabama expressly chose the common-law rule over more restrictive
    provisions. Ala. Code § 13A-3-27, Commentary, pp. 67-63 (1982).
    Missouri likewise considered but rejected a proposal akin to the

    1022 (CA8 1976) (Gibson, C. J., dissenting), vacated as moot *sub
    nom. Ashcroft* v. *Mattis,* 431 U. S. 171 (1977). Idaho, whose

[^40]: **^22^** In a recent report, the Department of Corrections of the
    District of Columbia also noted that "there is nothing inherently

    Project 2 (1985).

[^41]: **^23^** The dissent points out that three-fifths of all rapes in
    the home, three-fifths of all home robberies, and about a third of
    home assaults are committed by burglars.*Post,* at 26-27. These
    figures mean only that if one knows that a suspect committed a rape
    in the home, there is a good chance that the suspect is also a
    burglar. That has nothing to do with the question here, which is
    whether the fact that someone has committed a burglary indicates
    that he has committed, or might commit, a violent crime.

    The dissent also points out that this 3.8% adds up to 2.8 million
    violent crimes over a 10-year period, as if to imply that today's
    holding will let loose 2.8 million violent burglars. The relevant
    universe is, of course, far smaller. At issue is only that tiny
    fraction of cases where violence has taken place and an officer who
    has no other means of apprehending the suspect is unaware of its
    occurrence.

[^43]: **^2^** McGowan testified that \"brick" was code for \"cocaine."
    Luisi disputed that, testifying that his initial understanding was
    that a \"brick" referred to heroin, and that it took him a few

[^44]: **^3^** Although §922(n) does not contain a *mens rea*
    requirement, the relevant sentencing provision, § 924(a)(1)(D),

[^45]: **^4^** The Alaska statute defined duress and an exception
    thereto as follows:

    > Duress, (a) In any prosecution for an offense, it is an
    > affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the proscribed
    > conduct because he was coerced to do so by the use of unlawful
    > force upon him or a third person, which force a reasonable person
    > in his situation would have been unable to resist.
    >
    > \(b\) The defense of duress is not available when a person
    > recklessly places himself in a situation where it is probable that
    > he will be subject to duress.

    *Walker,*674 P.2d at 827.

[^46]: **^5^** In pertinent part, this statute defined compulsion as
    follows:

    > \(a\) A person is not guilty of an offense, other than an offense
    > punishable with death, by reason of conduct which he performs
    > under the compulsion of threat or menace of the imminent
    > infliction of death or great bodily harm, if he reasonably
    > believes death or great bodily harm will be inflicted upon him if
    > he does not perform such conduct.

    *Rodriquez,*332 N.E.2d at 196.

[^47]: **^6^** This section of the Colo.Rev.Stat. § 18 (1973) states
    that

    > A person may not be convicted of an offense other than a class 1
    > felony, based upon conduct in which he engaged because of the use
    > or the threatened use of unlawful force upon him or upon another
    > person, which force or threatened use thereof a reasonable person
    > in his situation would have been unable to resist. This defense is
    > not available when a person intentionally or recklessly places
    > himself in a situation in which it is foreseeable that he will be
    > subject to such force or threatened use thereof.

    *Bailey,*590 P.2d at 510.

[^48]: **^7^** The instructions appealed were as follows:

    > But, it is the law in this state on that subject, an act which
    > would otherwise constitute a crime may be excused on the grounds
    > it was done under duress or compulsion but the compulsion must be
    > present, imminent and impending and of such a nature as to induce
    > a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily injury if
    > the act is not done. A threat of future injury isn't enough to
    > excuse the criminal character of the act and compulsion claimed by
    > the defendant must have arisen without any negligence or fault on
    > his part*in* order to constitute a defense to the crime.

[^49]: **^8^** We further note that our decision is consistent with
    certain dicta in *Frasher v. State,* 8 Md.App. 439, 449-51, 260 A.2d
    656 (1970) and *Darby v. State,* 3 Md.App. 407, 416-22, 239 A.2d 584
    (1968). Neither of these cases, however, squarely addresses the
    issue presented in the case *sub judice.* In *Frasher,* we did note
    that the defense of duress was not available \"if the compulsion
    arose by the defendant's own fault, negligence or misconduct."
    *Frasher,* 8 Md.App. at 449. Similarly, in *Darby,* we approved the
    trial court\'s use of instruction on the issue of duress that in
    pertinent part stated "\[t\]he defense cannot be claimed if the
    defendant by his own fault or misconduct created the emergency or
    necessity which confronted him." *Darby,* 3 Md.App. at 420-21, 239
    A.2d 584 (quoting 1 *Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure,* § 123.)

     

     

     

[^50]: **^1^** We use the term \"associate" in its ordinary colloquial
    meaning. Luisi testified that the word \"associate" conveys a
    particular status within the LCN; we do not use the term in that
    sense.

[^51]: **^3^** On the tapes, it is actually McGowan who first refers to
    \'\'Danny," and he states that he had heard about White from
    Previte. However, a jury could conclude that Previte had first heard
    about Danny White from Luisi.

[^52]: **^4^** As the Government recognized at oral argument, there may
    be crimes where the nature of the *mens rea* would require the
    Government to disprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable
    doubt. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-27; see also, *e. g.,* 1 W. LaFave,
    Substantive Criminal Law § 5.1, p. 333 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter
    LaFave) (explaining that some common-law crimes require that the
    crime be done "\'maliciously'"); Black's Law Dictionary 968 (7th ed.
    1999) (defining malice as "\[t\]he intent, without justification or
    excuse, to commit a wrongful act").

[^53]: **^5^** Professor LaPave has explained the duress defense as
    follows:

    > "The rationale of the defense is not that the defendant, faced
    > with the unnerving threat of harm unless he does an act which
    > violates the literal language of the criminal law, somehow loses
    > his mental capacity to commit the crime in question. Nor is it
    > that the defendant has not engaged in a voluntary act. Rather it
    > is that, even though he has done the act the crime requires and
    > has the mental state which the crime requires, his conduct which
    > violates the literal language of the criminal law is excused ..
    > .." 2 LaFave § 9.7(a), at 73 (footnotes omitted).

[^54]: **^6^** While Congress' findings in support of the Safe Streets
    Act show that Congress was concerned because "the ease with which
    any person can acquire firearms \... is a significant factor in the
    prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States," §
    901(a)(2), 82 Stat. 225, it would be unrealistic to read this
    concern with the proliferation of firearm-based violent crime as
    implicitly doing away with a defense as strongly rooted in history
    as the duress defense, see, *e. g.,* 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
    on the Laws of England 30 (1769).

[^55]: **^7^** We have previously made this assumption when addressing
    common-law affirmative defenses, see *United States* v. *Oakland
    Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,* 532 U. S. 483, 491 (2001); *Bailey,*
    444 U. S., at 410, and the parties give us no reason to question it
    here.

[^56]: **^8^** Indeed, when a congressional committee did consider
    codifying the duress defense, it would have had the courts determine
    the defense "according to the principles of the common law as they
    may be interpreted in the light of reason and experience." S. 1437,
    95th Cong., 2d Sess., §501 (1978).

[^57]: **^9^** Duress, like the defense at issue in *McKelvey,* is an
    excuse that allows an exception from liability. See, *e. g.,* 2
    LaFave § 9.7, at 72 ("The rationale of the defense of duress is that
    the defendant ought to be excused when he 'is the victim of a threat
    that a person of reasonable moral strength could not fairly be
    expected to resist'").

[^58]: **^10^** In *D'Aquino* v. *United States,* 192 F. 2d 338, 358, n.
    11 (CA9 1951), the trial court instructed the jury that it would be
    warranted in acquitting the defendant on the basis that she acted
    under duress " '\[i\]f you believe from the evidence that the
    defendant committed these acts that the Government alleges . . .
    under a well grounded apprehension of immediate death or serious
    bodily injury\_\_\_\_This instruction did not require the Government
    to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt, and it seemingly
    placed the burden on the defendant to prove the existence of duress.

[^59]: **^4^** McGowan testified that this was due to the fact that
    Luisi was out of town for one week, and that McGowan had informed
    Luisi he would be out of town for the two weeks after that.

[^60]: **^5^** As recorded, the relevant portions of the conversation
    were as follows:

    > Merlino: Bob, can that guy, you know, do what he's got to do over
    > there for him?
    >
    > Luisi: Oh, yeah.
    >
    > Merlino: All right.
    >
    > Luisi: Yeah, that's, that's gonna, ah, that's gonna be.
    >
    > Previte: Okay.
    >
    > Merlino: All right.
    >
    > Luisi: You know?
    >
    > Merlino: You got it.

[^61]: **^6^** Carrozza\'s exact relationship to Luisi is somewhat
    unclear, but there was testimony suggesting that Carrozza was in
    some way affiliated with the LCN. There was also evidence that
    Carrozza worked directly with Lui-si and Vetere.

[^62]: **^7^** A third cocaine transaction was also negotiated, but it
    was never fully executed. On June 25, 1999, Luisi informed McGowan
    that the supply of cocaine had tightened and that things would be
    "dead" for a while. Luisi was arrested three days later.

[^63]: **^8^** On cross-examination, the government attempted to impeach
    Luisi by suggesting that the spiritual encounter was not genuine.
    Lui-si admitted that at least one member of his crew had been
    \"dabbling" in cocaine even after Luisi claimed to have ceased his
    involvement with drugs. Luisi also admitted that he was aware of
    this "dabbling," and that he shared in the profits that resulted
    from it. Luisi did say that the drug quantities involved in this
    "dabbling" were much smaller than the quantities involved in the
    deals with McGowan.

[^64]: **^9^** The district court did not provide a definition for the
    term \'\'government agent."

[^65]: **^10^** Some circuits have used a different meaning of
    "derivative entrapment." For example, the Seventh Circuit has used
    it to refer exclusively to situations in which the middleman is
    himself entrapped. *See Hollingsworth,* 27 F.3d at 1204. By
    contrast, the Fourth Circuit has used it to refer to *all*
    third-party entrapment cases. See *United States v. Squillacote,*
    221 F.3d 542, 573-74 & n. 19 (4th Cir.2000). The definition we use,
    which comes from a leading criminal law treatise, is a broad
    definition that is useful in distinguishing \"derivative entrapment"
    from "vicarious entrapment."

[^66]: **^12^** We also had no occasion to consider such a fact pattern
    in *United States v. Murphy,* 852 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1988). In that
    case, after we rejected the defendants' entrapment arguments, we
    relied on *Bradley* to explain why one defendant's claim to an
    entrapment instruction was \"foreclosed for an additional reason."
    *Id.* at 6. We noted that to allow the claim \"we would have \[had\]
    to create the fiction that \[the government agent\] *forced* \[the
    intermediary\] into dealing with" the defendant. *Id.* (emphasis
    added). To the extent that our use of the word \"forced" can be
    taken to imply a requirement of coercion, such an implication was
    dicta, as the government agent in the case never encouraged the
    middleman to bring anyone into the scheme, let alone the defendant.
    *See id.*

    We similarly did not deal with a pertinent fact pattern in*United
    States v. Hernandez,* 995 F.2d 307, 313 (1st Cir.1993). Like
    *Bradley* and *Murphy,* the case involved no government targeting of
    the individual defendant. *See id.*

[^67]: **^13^** Contrary to our precedent, several circuits
    categorically deny the entrapment defense in *all* third-party
    situations where the middleman is unaware that he is helping the
    government. *See Squillacote,* 221 F.3d at 574; *United States v.
    Thickstun,* 110 F.3d 1394, 1398 (9th Cir.1997); *United States v.
    Martinez,* 979 F.2d 1424, 1432 (10th Cir.1992). The Third Circuit's
    law varies. *Compare United States v. Klosterman,* 248 F.2d 191,
    195-96 (3d Cir.1957) (concluding that the third-party entrapment
    defense was available in a case where the defendant was specifically
    targeted and the middleman was unwitting), *with United States v.
    Beverly,* 723 F.2d 11, 12 (3d Cir.1983) (per curiam) (failing to
    cite *Klosterman* and claiming that the third-party entrapment
    defense is categorically unavailable when the middleman is
    unwitting). With the possible exception of the Ninth Circuit\'s
    opinion in *United States v. Emmert,* 829 F.2d 805 (9th Cir.1987),
    we are unaware of any cases in which these circuits have rejected
    the third-party defense when confronted with the kind of fact
    pattern we face here. As for *Emmert,* we respectfully disagree with
    the Ninth Circuit\'s conclusions.

[^68]: **^14^** Mere knowing tolerance is not presented by the facts
    here, and we do not reach that issue.

[^69]: **^15^** Indeed, the jury's question was premised on the idea
    that the government had caused Merlino to give the order. While the
    government observes that there was no evidence introduced at trial
    as to Merlino's lack of predisposition, none was needed. The premise
    of the jury\'s question was perfectly consistent with a finding that
    Merlino was predisposed to be involved in a cocaine transaction.
    *See Gendron,* 18 F.3d at 962 (distinguishing lack of predisposition
    from simple causation).

[^70]: **^16^** The government reads *Washington* differently,
    concluding that *Washington* requires the actual inducement applied
    to the intermediary to be the same kind of inducement applied to the
    defendant. This reading seems premised on an assumption that the FBI
    agent in *Washington* had improperly induced the middleman. Yet the
    court merely described the agent as "asking" for the middleman's
    assistance. *Washington,* 106 F.3d at 991. *Washington* contains no
    explanation of how this inducement was improper, and the court\'s
    logic suggests that any inquiry into the propriety of the agent's
    request would be irrelevant. Moreover, *Washington* cited an earlier
    D.C. Circuit case-£ayera-for its rule. *See id.* at 993-95. *Layeni*
    had in turn implied that the derivative entrapment defense is
    available if a government agent merely "suggests" to an intermediary
    that he apply particular inducements to a defendant. *See Layeni,*
    90 F.3d at 518.

[^71]: **^17^** The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have, in somewhat
    limited fashion, also rejected unwitting intermediary claims on the
    facts presented. *See, e.g., United States v. McLernon,* 746 F.2d
    1098, 1109 (6th Cir.1984); *United States v. Mers,* 701 F.2d 1321,
    1340 (11th Cir.1983). With one exception, we are not aware of any
    cases in which these circuits have faced facts similar to those in
    this case. The one exception would be the Fifth Circuit\'s 1980
    decision in *Anderton* --- which is binding precedent in the
    Eleventh Circuit, *see Bonner v. City of Prichard,* 661 F.2d 1206,
    1207 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc) --- and *Anderton* supports our
    reasoning in this case.

[^72]: **^18^** It is not clear to us whether the district court
    implicitly denied the motion or not, but in any event we are left
    with no findings of fact and no reasoning.

[^73]: **^19^** In *United States v. Twigg,* 588 F.2d 373 (3d Cir.1978),
    the Third Circuit did find outrageous misconduct. As our court has
    recognized, however, the Third Circuit has subsequently questioned
    its own holding in *Twigg. See United States v. Porter,* 764 F.2d 1,
    9 n. 4 (1st Cir.1985) (citing *Beverly,* 723 F.2d at 12). In any
    event, the factual background of *Twigg* makes it readily
    distinguishable.

[^74]: **^20^** In light of our disposition, we have no need to address
    Luisi\'s claim that he was sentenced improperly in light of *United
    States v. Booker,* 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621
    (2005).
