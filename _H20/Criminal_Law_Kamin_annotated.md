Export Customization Tips

We designed this opencasebook.org export using MS Word Styles to
simplify customization. The \"Styles Pane\" in Word\'s \"Home\" tab
shows a list of styles in the document, and the active style of your
current element or selection.

For example, you can quickly change the case text font for the whole
document by modifying the \"Case Body\" style. The style modification
screen also shows which style your style is \"Based On.\" If you modify
the style listed there, all styles based on it will also change. Some
older documents might use different styles than newer ones--- click into
an element and check the Styles Pane to confirm its style.

Check out Microsoft\'s [extensive styles
documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-styles-advantage-in-word-b4a6372f-188c-93cb-831b-c4dd0cb3a881)
for the finer points and caveats.

**Remember:** style modifications can yield sweeping results that
aren\'t always apparent on the page you\'re viewing. Make a backup copy
of your document before experimenting.

A Note about This Book

For the first twenty years that I taught this course, I used Sandy
Kadish and Stephen Schulhofer's Criminal Law and Its Processes as my
casebook. It's a great and enormous book. Sandy Kadish was a professor
of mine and I began teaching the course from the lecture notes that he
was good enough to share with me when I started teaching.

Over time, however, I've come to the conclusion that the book is more
enjoyable for professors than it is for students. It's deeply
theoretical, containing many notes, hypotheticals, and digressions that
fascinate and perplex. But as a means of learning the basics of first
year Criminal Law, I often found it frustrating. Particularly with the
challenges posed by the pandemic, teaching a book that felt decreasingly
user-friendly seemed like a bad idea.

Using the H2O open casebook resource from Harvard Law School, I have
tried to replicate the things I liked about the Kadish book while
leaving behind the things I didn't. I also tried to incorporate more
Colorado statutes and cases into the materials, to both illustrate
important points and help you learn a little more about the criminal
justice system here in our state. It also doesn't hurt that this open
source format allows me to bring you this content free of charge.

This book is a collaborative effort. It borrows from materials created
by others under a collective commons license. In particular, I have
drawn on the [materials prepared by W. David Ball at Santa
Clara](../../../../993-balloberman-current-challenges-in-criminal-law-comprehensive-listing-of-resources/)
and [by Jeannie Suk-Gersen at
Harvard](../../../../411-criminal-law-spring-2017/). These materials
have also benefitted greatly from student input over the last five
years.

What you see here is a continuing work in progress. As the semester goes
on, I may adapt these materials to match our pace and to incorporate
current events as they occur. You can always read an assignment or two
ahead, but please don\'t treat this book as written in stone. One huge
advantage of an online casebook like this is its flexibility; I will ask
you to be patient with me as I periodically make changes to these
materials to make them more relevant and appropriate.

As we go along, I'll welcome your feedback about which cases and other
materials work and which don't as well as places where more explanatory
notes (or more or different cases) would come in handy. Please don't be
shy about letting me know what works and what doesn't or even if you
just find typos or other errors in these materials.

Finally, an important note about disturbing content. Criminal cases
often have grisly facts. While I have chosen to make the material on sex
assault optional, there are still cases in this book that are likely to
upset and disturb some of you. I have endeavored to spare you the worst
of these cases and to edit the facts as best I could to convey the
relevant legal points without dwelling on the macabre. But we will still
encounter assaults, suicides, and other difficult material that may
strike close to home for many of you. Where appropriate, I have tried to
provide a warning about troubling content.

Furthermore, the cases I\'ve included span different eras and
jurisdictions. Not all of the opinions have enlightened views about
gender roles, race relations, or mental illness, among other topics. I
have included some of these less enlightened cases not because I agree
with their treatment of the relevant issues, but to demonstrate how far
the law has come in a relatively short period of time and how much is
left to be done.

A Note about Editing Cases

All of the cases in this book are edited. Often, I have edited out
analysis that was not germane to our discussion; I have also removed
most concurring and dissenting opinions, and streamlined some of the
courts\' majority opinions for clarity. For ease of readability I have
not indicated every omission, though I have clearly marked any language
in the opinions that is mine rather than the court's.

In editing these cases, I have attempted not to change the court's
reasoning or analysis. If you are puzzled by something you read -- if it
seems abrupt, poorly argued, or ahistorical -- remember that you are
reading only a few pages of what might have been a much longer opinion.

Each case has a citation that will allow you to view the full case if
you choose to do so. Obviously, you won't have the time or energy to
read all of every case in the book. I wouldn't want you to. But it might
make sense to, at least occasionally, pull up the full text of an
opinion to discover what's been omitted. If you think I have changed or
diminished the court's meaning, please let me know.

Theories of Punishment

 

As discussed above, criminal law differs from your other classes in a
number of ways. Principally, the criminal law condemns and punishes some
behavior in ways that other areas of law do not. Why do we punish
criminals? The answer might seem obvious, but it is important,
particularly at the outset, to think carefully about that question.

The justifications for criminal punishment generally fall into two
categories: consequentialist and non-consequentialist. Consequentialist
theories of punishment, which expect the use of criminal sanction to
reduce crime, typically consist of:

1.  Incapacitation \-- taking away the defendant\'s capacity to commit
    new crimes by depriving her of either her freedom or life. The
    defendant is made incapable of further offending.

2.  Deterrence \-- the imposition of negative consequences to convince
    either the individual punished, or the public more generally, that
    crime does not pay. The former is referred to as specific
    deterrence, the latter as general deterrence.

3.  Rehabilitation \-- the idea that separating the individual from
    society will give them the opportunity to change their criminal
    ways. Though it has fallen into disfavor in recent years, this
    theory had great sway in the creation of early penological
    institutions \-- states created reformatories or penitentiaries as
    places where rehabilitation could occur.

In contrast, the principal non-consequentialist theory is that of
retribution. Here, the idea is not to reduce crime \-- through reduced
opportunity or reduced inclination to commit crimes \-- but simply to
dole out just deserts. Retribution is idea that fairness requires
punishment for proven crimes even in the absence of any hope that it
will reduce crime.

As a general matter, we punish for both consequentialist and
nonconsequentialist reasons, and different theories of punishment might
counsel for different punishments even in the same case. Which, if any,
of these theories, justifies imposition of punishment on the defendants
in the following case? As we read more cases this semester, keep these
theories in mind and ask yourself whether you can see them playing out
in the courts\' opinions.

Regina v. Dudley & Stephens

 

This case is one of the classics of first year criminal law. Any lawyer
you meet is likely to remember it from their time in law school.

That said, the case is not easy to read. It is important to see that the
English high court begins by summarizing the factual findings of the
trial jury and noting that the jury was unable to come to a legal
conclusion regarding the defendants\' guilt. This surprises the court,
which spends much of its opinion considering whether some theory can
excuse the defendants for their grisly acts.

 

### *Regina v. Dudley & Stephens*

Queen's Bench Division

14 Q.B.D. 273 (1884)

 

LORD COLERIDGE, C J.  The two prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edwin
Stephens, were indicted for the murder of Richard Parker on the high
seas on the 25th of July in the present year.  They were tried before my
Brother Huddleston at Exeter on the 6th of November, and, under the
direction of my learned Brother, the jury returned a special verdict,
the legal effect of which has been argued before us, and on which we are
now to pronounce judgment.  The special verdict . . . is as follows.

That on July 5, 1884, the prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edward \[sic\]
Stephens, with one Brooks, all able-bodied English seamen, and the
deceased also an English boy, between seventeen and eighteen years of
age, the crew of an English yacht, a registered English vessel, were
cast away in a storm on the high seas 1,600 miles from the Cape of Good
Hope, and were compelled to put into an open boat belonging to the said
yacht.  That in this boat they had no supply of water and no supply of
food, except two 1 lb. tins of turnips, and for three days they had
nothing else to subsist upon.  That on the fourth day they caught a
small turtle, upon which they subsisted for a few days, and this was the
only food they had up to the twentieth day when the act now in question
was committed.  That on the twelfth day the remains of the turtle were
entirely consumed, and for the next eight days they had nothing to eat. 
That they had no fresh water, except such rain as they from time to time
caught in their oilskin capes.  That the boat was drifting on the ocean,
and was probably more than 1000 miles away from land.  That on the
eighteenth day, when they had been seven days without food and five
without water, the prisoners spoke to Brooks as to what should be done
if no succour came, and suggested that some one should be sacrificed to
save the rest, but Brooks dissented, and the boy, to whom they were
understood to refer, was not consulted.  That on the 24th of July, the
day before the act. now in question., the prisoner Dudley proposed to
Stephens and Brooks that lots should be cast who should be put to death
to save the rest, but Brooks refused to consent, and it was not put to
the boy, and in point of fact there was no drawing of lots.  That on the
day the prisoners spoke of their families, and suggested it would be
better to kill the boy that their lives should be saved, and Dudley
proposed that if there was no vessel in sight by the morrow morning the
boy should be killed.  That next day, the 25th of July, no vessel
appearing, Dudley told Brooks that he had better go and have a sleep,
and made signs to Stephens and Brooks that the boy had better be
killed.  The prisoner Stephens agreed to the act, but Brooks dissented
from it.  That the boy was then lying at the bottom of the boat quite
helpless and extremely weakened by famine and by drinking sea water, and
unable to make any resistance, nor did he ever assent to his being
killed.  The prisoner Dudley offered a prayer asking forgiveness for
them all if either of them should be tempted to commit a rash act, and
that their souls might be saved.  That Dudley, with the assent of
Stephens, went to the boy, and telling him that his time was come, put a
knife into his throat and killed him then and there; that the three men
fed upon the body and blood of the boy for four days; that on the fourth
day after the act had been committed the boat was picked up by a passing
vessel, and the prisoners were rescued, still alive, but in the lowest
state of prostration.  That they were carried to the port of Falmouth,
and committed for trial at Exeter.  That if the men had not fed upon the
body of the boy they would probably not have survived to be so picked up
and rescued, but would within four days have died of famine.  That the
boy, being in a much weaker condition, was likely to have died before
them.  That at the time of the act in question there was no sail in
sight, nor any reasonable prospect of relief.  That under these
circumstances there appeared to the prisoners every probability that
unless they then fed or very soon fed upon the boy or one of themselves
they would die of starvation.  That there was no appreciable chance of
saving life except by killing someone for the others to eat.  That
assuming any necessity to kill anybody, there was no greater necessity
for killing the boy than any of the other three men.  But whether upon
the whole matter by the jurors found the killing of Richard Parker by
Dudley and Stephens be felony and murder the jurors are ignorant, and
pray the advice of the Court thereupon, and if upon the whole matter the
Court shall be of opinion that the killing of Richard Parker be felony
and murder, then the jurors say that Dudley and Stephens were each
guilty of felony and murder as alleged in the indictment. . . .

From these facts, stated with the cold precision of a special verdict,
it appears sufficiently that the prisoners were subject to terrible
temptation, to sufferings which might break down the bodily power of the
strongest man, and try the conscience of the best.  Other details yet
more harrowing, facts still more loathsome and appalling, were presented
to the jury, and are to be found recorded in my learned Brother\'s
notes.  But nevertheless this is clear, that the prisoners put to death
a weak and unoffending boy upon the chance of preserving their own lives
by feeding upon his flesh and blood after he was killed, and with the
certainty of depriving him of any possible chance of survival.  The
verdict finds in terms that \"if the men had not fed upon the body of
the boy they would probably not have survived,\" and that \"the boy
being in a much weaker condition was likely to have died before them.\" 
They might possibly have been picked up next day by a passing ship; they
might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is
obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and
profitless act.  It is found by the verdict that the boy was incapable
of resistance, and, in fact, made none; and it is not even suggested
that his death was due to any violence on his part attempted against, or
even so much as feared by, those who killed him.  Under these
circumstances the jury say that they are ignorant whether those who
killed him were guilty of murder, and have referred it to this Court to
determine what is the legal consequence which follows from the facts
which they have found. . . .

\[T\]he real question in the case \[is\] whether killing under the
circumstances set forth in the verdict be or not be murder.  The
contention that it could be anything else was, to the minds of us all,
both new and strange, and we stopped the Attorney General in his
negative argument in order that we might hear what could be said in
support of a proposition which appeared to us to be at once dangerous,
immoral, and opposed to all legal principle and analogy. . . . First it
is said that it follows from various definitions of murder in books of
authority, which definitions imply, if they do not state, the doctrine,
that in order to save your own life you may lawfully take away the life
of another, when that other is neither attempting nor threatening yours,
nor is guilty of any illegal act whatever towards you or anyone else. 
But if these definitions be looked at they will not be found to sustain
this contention. . . .

It is . . . clear . . . that the doctrine contended for receives no
support from the great authority of Lord Hale.  It is plain that in his
view the necessity which justified homicide is that only which has
always been and is now considered a justification. . . . Lord Hale
regarded the private necessity which justified, and alone justified, the
taking the life of another for the safeguard of one\'s own to be what is
commonly called \"self defence.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, i. 478.)

But if this could be even doubtful upon Lord Hale\'s words, Lord Hale
himself has made it clear. For in the chapter in which he deals with the
exemption created by compulsion or necessity he thus expresses himself
\-- \"If a man be desperately assaulted and in peril of death, and
cannot otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his assailant\'s fury, he
will kill an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force
will not acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit
the fact \[sic\], for he ought rather to die himself than kill an
innocent; but if he cannot otherwise save his own life the law permits
him in his own defence to kill the assailant, for by the violence of the
assault, and the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself,
the law of nature, and necessity, hath made him his own protector. . .
.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, vol. i. 51.)

But, further still, Lord Hale in the following chapter deals with the
position asserted by the casuists, and sanctioned, as he says, by
Grotius and Puffendorf, that in a case of extreme necessity, either of
hunger or clothing; \"theft is no theft, or at least not punishable as
theft, as some even of our own lawyers have asserted the same.\" 
\"But,\" says Lord Hale, \"I take it that here in England, that rule, at
least by the laws of England, is false; and therefore, if a person,
being under necessity for want of victuals or clothes, shall upon that
account clandestinely and animo furandi\* steal another man\'s goods, it
is felony, and a crime by the laws of England punishable with death.\" 
(Hale, Pleas of the Crown, i. 54.)  If, therefore, Lord Hale is clear
\-- as he is \-- that extreme necessity of hunger does not justify
larceny, what would he have said to the doctrine that it justified
murder?  \[The opinion then reviewed other legal commentators and found
that none of them supported the defendants\' contentions.\]

Is there, then, any authority for the proposition which has been
presented to us?  Decided cases there are none. . . . The American case
\[United States v. Holmes, 26 F. Cas. 360, 1 Wall. Jr. 1 (C.C.E.D. Pa.
1842)\] in which it was decided, correctly indeed, that sailors had no
right to throw passengers overboard to save themselves, but on the
somewhat strange ground that the proper mode of determining who was to
be sacrificed was to vote upon the subject by ballot, can hardly be an
authority satisfactory to a court in this country. . . .

The one real authority of former time is Lord Bacon, who . . . lays down
the law as follows:  \"Necessity carrieth a privilege in itself.
Necessity is of three sorts \-- necessity of conservation of life,
necessity of obedience, and necessity of the act of God or of a
stranger.  First of conservation of life; if a man steals viands to
satisfy his present hunger, this is no felony nor larceny.  So if divers
be in danger of drowning by the casting away of some boat or barge, and
one of them get to some plank, or on the boat\'s side to keep himself
above water, and another to save his life thrust him from it, whereby he
is drowned, this is neither se defendendo nor by misadventure, but
justifiable.\" . . . Lord Bacon was great even as a lawyer; but it is
permissible to much smaller men, relying upon principle and on the
authority of others, the equals and even the superiors of Lord Bacon as
lawyers, to question the soundness of his dictum.  There are many
conceivable states of things in which it might possibly be true, but if
Lord Bacon meant to lay down the broad proposition that man may save his
life by killing, if necessary, an innocent and unoffending neighbour, it
certainly is not law at the present day. . . .

Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and
unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified
by some well recognised excuse admitted by the law.  It is further
admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing
was justified by what has been called \"necessity.\"  But the temptation
to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called
necessity.  Nor is this to be regretted.  Though law and morality are
not the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily
illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal
consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder
in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it.  It is
not so.  To preserve one\'s life is generally speaking a duty, but it
may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it.  War is full
of instances in which it is a man\'s duty not to live, but to die.  The
duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the
passengers, of soldiers to women and children; these duties impose on
men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice
of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is
to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not
shrunk.  It is not correct, therefore, to say that there is any absolute
or unqualified necessity to preserve one\'s life.  *Necesse est ut eam,
non ut vivam*,† is a saying of a Roman officer quoted by Lord Bacon
himself with high eulogy in the very chapter on necessity to which so
much reference has been made.  It would be a very easy and cheap display
of commonplace learning to quote from Greek and Latin authors, from
Horace, from Juvenal, from Cicero, from Euripides, passage after
passage, in which the duty of dying for others has been laid down in
glowing and emphatic language as resulting from the principles of
heathen ethics; it is enough in a Christian country to remind ourselves
of the Great Example whom we profess to follow.  It is not needful to
point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been
contended for.  Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity?  By
what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to
be strength, or intellect, or what?  It is plain that the principle
leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which
will justify him in deliberately taking another\'s life to save his own.
In this case the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting, was
chosen.  Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? 
The answer must be \"No\" \--

*So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,*\
*The tyrant\'s plea, excused his devilish deeds.*

It is not suggested that in this particular case the deeds were
\"devilish,\" but it is quite plain that such a principle once admitted
might be made the legal cloak for unbridled passion and atrocious
crime.  There is no safe path for judges to tread but to ascertain the
law to the best of their ability and to declare it according to their
judgment; and if in any case the law appears to be too severe on
individuals, to leave it to the Sovereign to exercise that prerogative
of mercy which the Constitution has entrusted to the hands fittest to
dispense it.

It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an
excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how
awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment
straight and the conduct pure.  We are often compelled to set up
standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we
could not ourselves satisfy.  But a man has no right to declare
temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it,
nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner
the legal definition of the crime.  It is therefore our duty to declare
that the prisoners\' act in this case was willful murder, that the facts
as stated in the verdict are no legal justification of the homicide; and
to say that in our unanimous opinion the prisoners are upon this special
verdict guilty of murder.‡

What Makes Criminal Law Different

 

What Makes Criminal Law Different

In other first year courses, judges often explicitly make the rules.
They decide whether a contract is enforceable or whether a tort defense
is available. By contrast in criminal law, the rules are generally made
by the state legislatures. The relevant state (or federal) statute tells
us what is forbidden and the job of courts \-- either judges or juries
\-- to interpret those statutes to determine whether the defendant has
done the things the legislature has prohibitted. In addition to being
nearly entirely statutory in nature, there are other factors that
distinguish criminal law from your other first year courses.

Principally, the criminal law involves moral blame in a way that other
topics of American law do not. So, for example, while we disapprove of
people who break contracts, who accidentally injure others, or who
damage the property of another, we do not judge them as lesser members
of the greater community. In particular, we do not deprive any of them
of the liberty the way we do those convicted of criminal offenses.
Convicted individuals can lose their freedom, their liberty -- including
their right to vote, their protection against forced servitude, etc --
and even their lives. These two ideas -- condemnation and punishment --
are often thought to be the defining characteristics that distinguish
crimes from other harms that society generally lets individuals resolve
through a private system of monetary compensation.

Because of these differences, the criminal justice system is organized
quite differently from the rest of the American courts system. First,
and perhaps most fundamentally, criminal cases are brought by the
government on behalf of the people rather than by the injured party
herself. This is why our cases have titles like *Queen v. Smit*h, *State
v. Jones*, or *People v. Johnson*. While the government merely provides
courts for individuals to resolve disputes for other kinds of harms,
society considers criminal conduct to be a different kind of
transgression. Crime is so serious a violation of the social contract
that it is prosecuted by the state rather than left to be resolved
between the private individuals involved.

For these reasons -- the high stakes and the fact that criminal
prosecution involves the apparatus of the state operating against a lone
individual -- the American criminal justice system contains many
protections which are either written into, or implicit in, the federal
constitution. Some of these will be familiar to you. For example, in a
criminal case, the government bears the burden of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt on every element of a criminal offense; in civil cases
the plaintiff need only prove her case to the far lower standard of
preponderance of the evidence. A criminal defendant also enjoys the
right to an attorney, the right to remain silent, the right to trial by
jury, the right to confront witnesses against her, and so forth. Upper
year classes in criminal procedure will investigate these rights in
detail. As we go through the course, however, I will point out places
where the criminal justice system, at least in theory, is designed to
make it difficult for the state to deprive an individual of her liberty.

example, as

table shows, of the 79,704 criminal defendants in federal court in the
year studied, 71,550 pled guilty, while only 1,879 trials were held.
Thus, though we will pay a fair amount of attention to criminal trials,
it is important to remember that nearly all criminal cases are resolved
without a trial.

The American criminal justice system is unique in both its scope and its
organization. Before we start discussing what conduct is criminal (or
whether particular conduct *should* be criminal) it is important to
understand exactly what the criminal justice system is.

The [Prison Policy

excellent job of both describing the scope of the criminal justice
system and breaking it down into its component parts. Please familiarize
yourself with how many people are currently incarcerated, where, and for
what. We will refer to this information throughout the semester.

Colorado Model Jury Instructions

 

Although this course is designed to give you an overview of how criminal
law works in the United States, we will often use Colorado law as an
illustrative example. Below are the model jury instructions for some
familiar (and unfamiliar) crimes. The idea is to give you some
familiarity with how crimes are explained to lay juries; later in the
semester we will go into far greater depth on a number of these crimes
as well as others. For now, the point is not to master (or even
memorize) the elements of these offenses, but rather to get used to
reading statutes and understanding what they do (and do not) prohibit.

 

 

 

 

1.3.1

Criminal Law Is Statutory Interpretation

 

### Criminal Law Is Statutory Interpretation

 

Criminal law is about reading and applying statutes. Unlike your other
first year classes, criminal law is almost entirely statutory in nature
-- if the legislature has not prohibited particular conduct, it is
generally not criminal.

This has not always been the case. Traditionally, criminal law was what
*courts* said it was. The idea of common law crimes -- crimes defined by
court decisions rather than legislatures -- was widespread in England
for centuries. After American independence, many states formally adopted
English common law, including its definition of common law crimes.

As time went on, however, states began to codify the definitions of
various crimes and nearly all abolished the idea that courts could
create new crimes. Today, it is largely presumed that unless the
legislature has prohibited the defendant's conduct, he cannot be
convicted of a crime; the courts will punish that conduct, and only that
conduct, that the legislature has chosen to prohibit.

For example, many first year students are surprised to learn that
burglary is defined (loosely) as breaking and entering at night with the
intent to commit a felony inside. Thus, a person has completed the crime
of burglary when they have entered (what we'll call the actus reus or
bad act) intending to steal the owner\'s possessions (what we'll call
the mens rea or guilty mind). Television and movies have accustomed us
to thinking of the burglar as the person in the ski mask leaving a house
with a sack full of loot. But looking, carefully, at the statute
prohibiting burglary shows us that he need not actually steal anything
in order to be guilty of burglary.

In this course we will look carefully at a number of criminal statutes
and at the instructions that are given to juries trying defendants
accused of violating those statutes. The legislatures write the statutes
\-- the state's prohibition of specific conduct -- and the state
judiciary determines how to explain these statutes to lay juries in a
way that will be comprehensible to them and consistent with the
legislature's intent. Ultimately, however, the legislature is in charge
of the meaning of its statutes and, if it disagrees with how the
judiciary has interpreted its statutes, it may override that reading by
making its true intent clear and amending the law.

This move to statutory definition of crimes is an example of what is
known as the principle of legality -- that crimes must be clearly laid
out before they may be enforced. Often expressed in Latin as *nulla
poena sine lege*, the idea that there can be no punishment without law
is often perceived as one of the cornerstones of a just legal system.
But ask yourself whether the requirement of a statutory definition of
crimes is either a necessary or a sufficient condition for fairness.
Would it be unfair to punish an individual for murder in the absence of
a statute prohibiting the intentional killing of another human being
with malice aforethought? Conversely, would it be fair to punish an
individual for unknowingly possessing a prohibited substance simply
because, unbeknownst to the defendant, the substance is included on a
list of banned substances in an obscure piece of legislation?

Elements & Basics

 

This section instroduces you to the two principal building blocks of the
criminal law: the voluntary act (or actus reus) and the culpable mental
state (mens rea). Generally speaking both must be proven before a
defendant can be convicted. Of course, as with so much in the law, it\'s
not quite that simple.

 

 

 

 

2.1

The Actus Reus Requirement

 

Actus reus, or the act requirement, is the first component of
culpability in criminal law. (You will meet the second part, mens rea,
in the next section.) In short the actus reus requirement assures us
that we cannot be punished for our thoughts alone. We must act, and act
voluntarily, before criminal punishment may be imposed.

These cases introduce you to the act requirement. Notice distinctions
between voluntary and involuntary acts, and between acts and omissions
(failures to act). Consider why the court reaches the decision it does
in each case, and what its decision says about when a defendant may
properly be punished for her conduct.

 

 

 

 

2.1.1

The Voluntary Act

 

Generally speaking, we only punish conduct that the defendant does
voluntarily. We would all agree that it is unjust to punish someone for
an act done while sleeping, while convulsing in a spasm, or while under
another\'s control. But defining exactly which acts are fairly
attributable to an individual and which are not can be complicated.
These cases investigate that distinction.

 

 

 

 

2.1.1.1

Martin v. State

 

Unlike most of the cases in this book, this one is unedited. This is the
Alabama Court\'s full decision on this point.

 

### *Martin v. State*

Alabama Court of Appeals

17 So. 2d 427 (Ala. Crim. App. 1944)

 

SIMPSON, Judge.

Appellant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway, and appeals.
Officers of the law arrested him at his home and took him onto the
highway, where he allegedly committed the proscribed acts, viz.,
manifested a drunken condition by using loud and profane language.

The pertinent provisions of our statute are: \"Any person who, while
intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more
persons are present, . . . and manifests a drunken condition by
boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on
conviction, be fined\"

Under the plain terms of this statute, a voluntary appearance is
presupposed. The rule has been declared, and we think it sound, that an
accusation of drunkenness in a designated public place cannot be
established by proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated
condition, was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the
arresting officer.

Conviction of appellant was contrary to this announced principle and, in
our view, erroneous. It appears that no legal conviction can be
sustained under the evidence, so, consonant with the prevailing rule,
the judgment of the trial court is reversed and one here rendered
discharging appellant.

Of consequence, our original opinion of affirmance was likewise laid in
error. It is therefore withdrawn.

Reversed and rendered.

 

 

 

2.1.1.2

Model Penal Code Section 2.01

 

The Model Penal Code is what its name suggests: A model, or ideal,
criminal code. It was produced by the Americal Law institute in 1962,
the same organization that created the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and
Restatement of Torts. Since its publication, large parts of the code
have been adopted in a number of states, including Colorado, while other
parts have met with little public acceptance. In this course we will
make use of the MPC to contrast the traditional, common law approach to
interpreting criminal statutes with the (relatively) modern approach
suggested by the code. You will want to keep track of the MPC sections
we reference throughout the course.

 

### MPC § 2.01 Requirement of Voluntary Act; Omission as Basis of Liability; Possession as an Act.

\(1\) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based
on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an
act of which he is physically capable.

\(2\) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this
Section:

\(a\) a reflex or convulsion;

\(b\) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;

\(c\) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;

\(d\) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or
determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

 

 

 

2.1.1.3

Comment to Section 2.01(1)

 

The Official Commentary to the MPC is designed to clarify or expound on
the text of the Code itself. We will refer to the Commentary throughout
the semester as we wrestle to make sense of the MPC provisions.

 

### Comment to Section 2.01(1)

 

That penal sanctions cannot be employed with justice unless these
requirements are satisfied seems wholly clear. It is fundamental that a
civilized society does not punish for thoughts alone. Beyond this, the
law cannot hope to deter involuntary movement or to stimulate action
that cannot physically be performed; the sense of personal security
would be undermined in a society where such movement or inactivity could
lead to formal social condemnation of the sort that a conviction
necessarily entails. People whose involuntary movements threaten harm to
others may present a public health or safety problem, calling for
therapy or even for custodial confinement; they do not present a problem
of correction.

Excerpt, People v. Decina

 

### *People v. Decina*

Court of Appeals of New York

2 N.Y.2d 133 (1956)

 

The indictment states essentially that defendant, knowing "that he was
subject to epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to
lose consciousness for a considerable period of time", was culpably
negligent "in that he consciously undertook to and did operate his Buick
sedan on a public highway" (emphasis supplied) and "while so doing"
suffered such an attack which caused said automobile "to travel at a
fast and reckless rate of speed, jumping the curb and driving over the
sidewalk" causing the death of 4 persons. In our opinion, this clearly
states a violation of section 1053-a of the Penal
Law.[\[1\]](#Xb882b61758865e726b340d5ea5a47ab87180b0c) The statute does
not require that a defendant must deliberately intend to kill a human
being, for that would be murder. Nor does the statute require that he
knowingly and consciously follow the precise path that leads to death
and destruction. It is sufficient, we have said, when his conduct
manifests a "disregard of the consequences which may ensue from the act,
and indifference to the rights of others. No clearer definition,
applicable to the hundreds of varying circumstances that may arise, can
be given. Under a given state of facts, whether negligence is culpable
is a question of judgment." *People v. Angelo*, 246 N.Y. 451, 457.

Assuming the truth of the indictment, as we must on a demurrer, this
defendant knew he was subject to epileptic attacks and seizures that
might strike at any time. He also knew that a moving motor vehicle
uncontrolled on public highway is a highly dangerous instrumentality
capable of unrestrained destruction. With this knowledge, and without
anyone accompanying him, he deliberately took a chance by making a
conscious choice of a course of action, in disregard of the consequences
which he knew might follow from his conscious act, and which in this
case did ensue. How can we say as a matter of law that this did not
amount to culpable negligence within the meaning of section 1053-a?

To hold otherwise would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself
in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if
it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and
reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or
involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution under
the statute. His awareness of a condition which he knows may produce
such consequences as here, and his disregard of the consequences,
renders him liable for culpable negligence, as the courts below have
properly held. To have a sudden sleeping spell, an unexpected heart or
other disabling attack, without any prior knowledge or warning thereof,
is an altogether different situation, and there is simply no basis for
comparing such cases with the flagrant disregard manifested here.

\*\*\*

Accordingly, the Appellate Division properly sustained the lower court's
order overruling the demurrer, as well as its denial of the motion in
arrest of judgment on the same ground.

[\[1\]](#Xe6929d23ef167a8cf73c312501e5dc2f7de4d78) Section 1053-a
provides:

A person who operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or
culpably negligent manner, whereby a human being is killed, is guilty of
criminal negligence in operation of a vehicle resulting in death.

The section provides for "imprisonment for a term not exceeding five
years or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by both."

Voluntary v. Involuntary Act Examples

 

Which of the following scenarios contain blameworthy, voluntary acts? By
contrast, which scenarios exemplify involuntary acts for which the
individual cannot be blamed.

1.  Kamin resolves to stop say "Right?" at the end of his sentences. He
    thinks he's gotten through an entire class without doing so, but
    when he watches the video at the end of the day he realizes he
    failed.

2.  Jones is listening to the radio while driving and, distracted by her
    favorite song, ends up driving three exits past her own.

3.  Roberts trips over a rock and falls to the ground, bumping into
    Victim, who falls off a ledge to her death

4.  Garcia goes to a performance that includes a demonstration by a
    hypnotist. Garcia volunteers and allows herself to be hypnotized;
    while hypnotized, she goes on a rampage, injuring several members of
    the audience.

5.  After being acquitted in (4) above, Garcia goes to another hypnotist
    demonstration and the same thing happens.

 

 

 

 

2.1.1.6

Sample Problem based on Cogdon case.

 

A problem based on *The King v. Cogdon*, an unreported Canadian case
described by Norval Morris in his article *Somnambulistic Homicide:
Ghosts, Spiders, and North Koreans*, 5 Res Judicatae 29 (1951):

\[Mrs. Cogdon\] told how, on the night before her daughter\'s death, she
had dreamt that their house was full of spiders and that these spiders
were crawling all over \[her daughter\] Pat. In her sleep, Mrs. Cogdon
left the bed she shared with her husband, went into Pat\'s room, and
awakened to find herself violently brushing at Pat\'s face, presumably
to remove the spiders. This woke Pat. Mrs. Cogdon told her she was just
tucking her in.  There had also been a previous dream in which ghosts
had sat at the end of Mrs. Cogdon\'s bed and she had said to them,
"Well, you have come to take Pattie."

The morning after the spider dream she told her doctor of it. He gave
her a sedative and, because of the dream and certain previous
difficulties she had reported, discussed the possibility of psychiatric
treatment. \[That evening, Mrs. Cogdon put Pat to sleep while Mr. Cogdon
was out for the evening.\] There was some desultory conversation between
them about the war in Korea, and just before she put out her light Pat
called out to her mother, "Mum, don\'t be so silly worrying there about
the war, it\'s not on our front door step yet."

Mrs. Cogdon went to sleep. She dreamt that "the war was all around the
house," that soldiers were in Pat\'s room, and that one soldier was on
the bed attacking Pat. This was all of the dream she could later
recapture. Her first "waking" memory was of running from Pat\'s room,
out of the house to the home of her sister who lived next door. When her
sister opened the front door Mrs. Cogdon fell into her arms, crying, "I
think I\'ve hurt Pattie."

In fact Mrs. Cogdon had, in her somnambulistic state, left her bed,
fetched an axe from the woodheap, entered Pat\'s room, and struck her
two accurate forceful blows on the head with the blade of the axe, thus
killing her.

1.  What is the best argument in favor of holding Mrs. Cogdon criminally
    responsible for the death of her daughter?

2.  What is the strongest argument *against* holding her criminally
    responsible?

2.1.2

Liability for Omissions

 

The previous section described which acts of a defendant can be deemed
voluntary, and hence, when a defendant can fairly be held accountable
for those actions.

In this section, we ask a slightly different question. When, if ever, is
it just to hold a defendant liable for *failing* to act?

Pope v. State

 

CW: Child Abuse

 

### *Pope v. State*

Maryland Court of Appeals

396 A.2d 1054 (Md. App. 1979)

 

ORTH, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.

Joyce Lillian Pope was found guilty by the court in the Circuit Court
for Montgomery County under the 3rd and 5th counts of a nine count
indictment. The 3rd count charged child abuse, presenting that \"on or
about April 11, 1976, . . . while having the temporary care, custody and
responsibility for the supervision of Demiko Lee Norris, a minor child
under the age of eighteen years \[she\] did unlawfully and feloniously
cause abuse of said minor child in violation of Article 27, Section 35A
of the Annotated Code of Maryland\....\" The 5th count charged
misprision of felony[\[1\]](#Xa84379bf7536144e009f03b4516962671d0ee14)
under the common law, alleging that on the same date she \"did
unlawfully and wilfully conceal and fail to disclose a felony to wit:
the murder of Demiko Lee Norris committed by Melissa Vera Norris on
April 11, 1976, having actual knowledge of the commission of the felony
and the identity of the felon, with the intent to obstruct and hinder
the due course of justice and to cause the felon to escape
unpunished\...\"

## **THE EVIDENCE**

The evidence adduced at the trial established that Demiko Lee Norris,
three months old, died as a result of physical injuries inflicted by his
mother, Melissa Vera Norris. The abuse by the mother occurred over a
period of several hours on a Sunday morning at Pope\'s home and in
Pope\'s presence. Pope\'s involvement in the events leading to the
child\'s abuse and death began on the preceding Friday evening when she
and Melissa, with the child, were driven home by Pope\'s sister, Angela
Lancaster, from a service held at the Christian Tabernacle Church. When
they arrived at Melissa\'s grandparents\' home, where Melissa was
living, Melissa refused to enter the house, claiming that it was on
fire, although in fact it was not. During the evening, Melissa had
sporadically indicated mental distress. \"She would at times seem caught
up in a religious frenzy with a wild look about her, trying to preach
and declaring that she was God. She would as quickly resume her normal
self without ever seeming to notice her personality transitions.\" Pope
agreed to take Melissa and the child into her home for the night because
she did not want to put them \"out on the street,\" and Angela would not
let them stay in her home. Melissa had no money and Pope and Angela
bought food and diapers for the baby. Throughout the day Melissa
\"changed back and forth.\" When Melissa was \"herself\" she took care
of her child. When Melissa thought she was God, Pope undertook the
maternal duties. Pope watched the child \"like it was my own,\" because
\"I felt maybe \[Melissa\] could \[hurt the child\] when she confessed
she was God. . . I felt close to the baby, maybe because, you know, I
felt I haven\'t had a baby for so long, you know, I enjoyed taking care
of the baby and watching it.\" At a baby shower Saturday evening at the
home of Pope\'s mother, Melissa again reverted to being God

\[The court then described, in graphic detail the abuse that Melissa
administered to her son over the course of the next day.  The injured
child was eventually brought back to church where it was discovered that
he had died of his injuries. \-- Ed.\]

The police questioned Melissa in Pope\'s presence. Pope did not
contradict Melissa\'s denial of abusing the child. In fact, Pope, in
response to inquiry by the police, said that the baby did not fall, and
told them that she had not seen Melissa strike the baby. She explained
this untruth in subsequent statements to the police: \"\[I\]t was her
body in the flesh, but it wasn\'t her, because it was something else.\"

As we have indicated, a person may be convicted of the felony of child
abuse created by § 35A as a principal in the first degree upon evidence
legally sufficient to establish that the person

\(1\) was

\(a\) the parent of, or

\(b\) the adoptive parent of, or

\(c\) in loco parentis to, or

\(d\) responsible for the supervision of

a minor child under the age of eighteen years, AND

\(2\) caused, by being in some manner accountable for, by act of
commission or omission, abuse to the child in the form of

\(a\) physical injury or injuries sustained by the child as the result
of

i\) cruel or inhumane treatment, or

ii\) malicious act or acts by such person, or

\(b\) any act or acts by such person involving sexual molestation or
exploitation whether or not physical injuries were sustained.

. . . Pope\'s lack of any attempt to prevent the numerous acts of abuse
committed by the mother over a relatively protracted period and her
failure to seek medical assistance for the child, although the need
therefore was obviously compelling and urgent, could constitute a cause
for the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to
the child\'s death. In such circumstances, Pope\'s omissions constituted
in themselves cruel and inhumane treatment within the meaning of the
statute. It follows that Pope would be guilty of child abuse *if her
status brought her within the class of persons specified by the
statute.* It being clear that she was neither the child\'s parent nor
adoptive parent, and there being no evidence sufficient to support a
finding that she had \"the permanent or temporary care or custody\" of
the child as that status was construed so as to be in loco parentis to
the child, the sole question is whether she had \"responsibility for the
supervision of\" the child in the circumstances. If she had such
responsibility the evidence was legally sufficient to find her guilty of
child abuse as a principal in the first degree.

The State would have us translate compassion and concern, acts of
kindness and care, performance of maternal functions, and general help
and aid with respect to the child into responsibility for the
supervision of the child. The crux of its argument is that although Pope
was not under any obligation to assume responsibility for the
supervision of the child at the outset, \"once she undertook to house,
feed, and care for \[the mother and child\], she did accept the
responsibility and came within the coverage of the statute.\" But the
mother was always present. Pope had no right to usurp the role of the
mother even to the extent of responsibility for the child\'s
supervision. We are in full accord with the view of the Court of Special
Appeals that it could not \"in good conscience hold that a person who
has taken in a parent and child is given the responsibility for the
child\'s supervision and protection even while the child is in the very
arms of its mother.\" It would be most incongruous that acts of
hospitality and kindness, made out of common decency and prompted by
sincere concern for the well-being of a mother and her child, subjected
the Good Samaritan to criminal prosecution for abusing the very child he
sought to look after. And it would be especially ironic were such
criminal prosecution to be predicated upon an obligation to take
affirmative action with regard to abuse of the child by its mother, when
such obligation arises solely from those acts of hospitality and
kindness.

The evidence does not show why Pope did not intervene when the mother
abused the child or why she did not, at least, timely seek medical
assistance, when it was obvious that the child was seriously injured.
Whether her lack of action was from fear or religious fervor or some
other reason is not clearly indicated. As the Court of Special Appeals
correctly stated \"\[Pope\'s\] testimony sought to indicate that her
passivity was motivated by fear but other evidence belied that
inference.\" The court observed that when Pope\'s sister arrived shortly
after the acts of abuse and the mother\'s frenzy had diminished, Pope
did not tell her sister what had occurred, although she claimed that she
tried to but could not do so. But Pope\'s conduct, during and after the
acts of abuse, must be evaluated with regard for the rule that although
she may have had a strong moral obligation to help the child, she was
under no legal obligation to do so unless she then had responsibility
for the supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse
statute. She may not be punished as a felon under our system of justice
for failing to fulfill a moral obligation, and the short of it is that
she was under no legal obligation. In the circumstances, the mother\'s
acquiescence in Pope\'s conduct was not a grant of responsibility to
Pope for the supervision of the child, nor was Pope\'s conduct an
acceptance of such responsibility. \"\[Pope\'s\] concern for the child
\[did\] not convert to legal responsibility nor parental prerogatives.\"
*Pope,* 38 Md. App. at 538. We hold that the evidence was not sufficient
in law to prove that Pope fell within that class of persons to whom the
child abuse statute applies. Thus it is that the judgment of the trial
court that she was a principal in the first degree in the commission of
the crime of child abuse was clearly erroneous and must be set aside.

The mental or emotional state of the mother, whereby at times she held
herself out as God, does not change the result. We see no basis in the
statute for an interpretation that a person \"has\" responsibility for
the supervision of a child, if that person believes or may have reason
to believe that a parent is not capable of caring for the child. There
is no right to make such a subjective judgment in order to divest
parents of their rights and obligations with respect to their minor
children, and therefore, no obligation to do so.

The evidence certainly showed that Pope \"witnessed a terrible event\"
and that she \"stood by\" while the mother killed the child. But the
culpability for her conduct during the abuse of the child must be
determined strictly within the law or else the basic tenets of our
system of justice are prostituted. There is an understandable feeling of
outrage at what occurred, intensified by the fact that the mother, who
actually beat the child to death, was held to be not responsible for her
criminal acts. But it is the law, not indignation, which governs. The
law requires that Pope\'s conviction of the felony of child abuse be set
aside as clearly erroneous due to evidentiary insufficiency.

There is no Maryland legislative enactment which is declarative of the
common law crime of misprision of felony or which may be deemed to have
created a comparable offense. Therefore, if misprision of felony is a
crime in this State, it is only because it was part of the common law of
England to which the inhabitants of Maryland were constitutionally
entitled and has survived to the present time.

We assume, *arguendo,* that misprision of felony was a crime under the
common law of England, and that it became the law of this State pursuant
to Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights. The question is whether it is to
be deemed an indictable offense in Maryland today. . . We are satisfied,
considering its origin, the impractical and indiscriminate width of its
scope, its other obvious deficiencies, and its long non-use, that it is
not now compatible with our local circumstances and situation and our
general code of laws and jurisprudence. Maintenance of law and order
does not demand its application, and, overall, the welfare of the
inhabitants of Maryland and society as enjoyed by us today, would not be
served by it. If the Legislature finds it advisable that the people be
obligated under peril of criminal penalty to disclose knowledge of
criminal acts, it is, of course, free to create an offense to that end,
within constitutional limitations, and, hopefully, with adequate
safeguards. We believe that the common law offense is not acceptable by
today\'s standards, and we are not free to usurp the power of the
General Assembly by attempting to fashion one that would be. We hold
that misprision of felony is not a chargeable offense in Maryland.

[\[1\]](#X56bebc9c573f685cfdd3fa0fb35ff5a25dd67b0) Misprision of felony
occurs when a person who has witnessed a felony does not notify the
authorities.

State v. Shell

 

A number of jursidctions are changing their homicide statutes in order
to punish as murderers those who provide drugs to another leading to the
other\'s death. The Colorado legislature considered but rejected such a
law in 2023. In the absence of such a law, when should one who provides
drugs to another be responsible for the overdose death of the person to
whom he supplied the drugs? This case considers one state\'s approach.

 

### *State v. Shell*

Missouri Court of Appeals

501 S.W.3d 22 (Missouri App. 2016)

 

In January 2012, Defendant and James Eyman (Decedent) were planning to
buy heroin. In text messages, Decedent told Defendant that he had \$40
to put toward the purchase. Combined with Defendant\'s \$30, the men
were able to purchase seven doses of heroin. Defendant contacted his
heroin dealer and purchased all \$70 worth of heroin, to be paid back by
Decedent when they met up later in the evening.

After buying the heroin, Defendant went to Decedent\'s parents\' house
--- where Decedent was living at the time --- and picked up Decedent.
The men went to Defendant\'s house, where they each injected themselves
with heroin. Defendant took three doses, while Decedent took four.
Defendant drove Decedent back to his parents\' house around 11:00 p.m.
Decedent went inside, told his mother that he was tired and going to
bed, and went into his bedroom.

At around 1:00 p.m. the next day, Decedent\'s mother went to check on
him because he had not gotten up yet. She discovered Decedent was dead.
Subsequently, Defendant was charged with distribution of a controlled
substance and first-degree involuntary manslaughter. \...

At the conclusion of trial, the jury found Defendant guilty of
distribution of a controlled substance and first-degree involuntary
manslaughter. The court sentenced Defendant to concurrent terms of
eighteen years\' imprisonment for distribution and fifteen years\'
imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter. Defendant appeals.

Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction
for involuntary manslaughter. Defendant argues that he did not have a
duty to seek medical care for Decedent.

Criminal liability \"is premised on a defendant\'s conduct involving
voluntary acts.\" ​ A voluntary act can be an omission to perform an act.
​However, a defendant cannot be guilty of an offense \"based solely upon
an omission to perform an act unless the law defining the offense
expressly so provides, or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise
imposed by law.\"

Therefore, we must determine whether Defendant had a duty to seek
medical care for Decedent, and if so, whether he satisfied said duty.  

**A. Did Defendant have a duty to act?**

As noted, because Missouri\'s involuntary manslaughter statute does not
explicitly consider a defendant\'s failure to act, a duty to perform the
omitted act must be otherwise imposed by law\.... There are at least
four situations that may give rise to a duty to act: (1) where a statute
imposes a duty to care for another; (2) where the defendant stands in a
certain status relationship to another; (3) where the defendant assumed
a contractual duty to care for another; and (4) where one has
voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless
person as to prevent others from rendering aid. ​*Gargus*,​ 462 S.W.3d at
422​ (citing ​*Jones v. United States*,​ 308 F.2d 307, 310 (D.C.Cir.
1962)​). A defendant stands in a \"certain status relationship\" with the
victim in cases \"where some act or omission on the part of the
defendant either created or increased the risk of injury to
\[another\]\" ​

Here, Defendant argues that he did not have a duty to seek medical help
for Decedent because none of the situations as laid out in ​*Gargus*​
apply to the facts of his case, and specifically that he did not stand
in a \"certain status relationship\" to Decedent. Defendant maintains
that even if the law did impose a duty to act, he satisfied any duty by
inviting Decedent to stay the night, and once Decedent rejected
Defendant\'s offer, Defendant had no further duty to provide help. The
State counters that Defendant did, in fact, have a duty to act because
he voluntarily assumed the care of a vulnerable person (Decedent) and
Decedent was reliant upon Defendant for medical care.

In ​\[*State v. Voss*, 488 S.W.3d 97 (Mo. App. E.D. 2016)\] this Court
held that the defendant had a duty to act because he \"created and/or
increased the risk of injury to \[the victim\]\" by providing the victim
with heroin, suggesting how much heroin the victim should use, helping
the victim prepare the heroin for ingestion, and \"leaving the hotel
room after \[the victim\] exhibited signs of an overdose which \[the
defendant\] recognized as such.\" Accordingly, the Court concluded that
because the law imposed a duty to act, a reasonable juror could have
concluded that the defendant breached said duty by failing to go back to
the hotel room or obtain medical help for the victim.

Here, we cannot conclude that Defendant \"created and/or increased the
risk of injury\" to Decedent. The present case is factually
distinguishable from ​*Voss*,​ where the defendant played a much more
active role in the victim\'s drug overdose. Unlike ​*Voss*,​ Defendant\'s
role in Decedent\'s heroin use was simply that of distributor. During
Defendant\'s trial, there was no evidence that Defendant suggested how
much heroin for Decedent to use or that Defendant actively helped
Decedent ingest the drugs. While we certainly do not condone
Defendant\'s delivery of heroin to Decedent, the present case does not
rise to the level of creating or increasing the risk of injury. Under
this Court\'s holding in ​*Voss*,​ such a special relationship requires
more than just delivery of the heroin. Therefore, we conclude that the
law did not impose a duty because Defendant did not create and/or
increase the risk of injury to Decedent.

Regardless, we next consider the State\'s argument that the law imposed
a duty because Defendant voluntarily assumed the care of a vulnerable
person who was reliant upon him for medical care. . . Here, we cannot
conclude that Defendant voluntarily assumed the care of Decedent and
that Decedent was entirety dependent upon Defendant for his medical
care. While Defendant and Decedent engaged in drug use together, various
other facts established at trial support our conclusion. After Defendant
dropped Decedent back at his parents\' house, Decedent had a
conversation with his mother. Decedent may have started a load of
laundry, and then he told his mother that he was tired, said goodnight,
and told her that he loved her. These facts, when considered in the
context of Decedent\'s entire evening, show that Decedent was not
entirely dependent upon Defendant. Furthermore, Defendant was not the
only person with whom Decedent had interactions after ingesting the
drugs. Accordingly, we conclude that the law did not impose a duty to
act because Defendant did not seclude Decedent, and Decedent was not
dependent upon Defendant for medical care.

**Conclusion**

Given the foregoing, we affirm Defendant\'s conviction of Count I,
distribution of a controlled substance. We reverse and vacate
Defendant\'s conviction of Count II, involuntary manslaughter.

2.1.2.4

MPC Section 2.01(3)

 

MPC Section 2.01(3) shows that the MPC and common law positions are in
sync: One is not liable for failing to act absent a legal (as opposed to
a moral) obligation to do so.

We have previously seen in Section 2.01(1) that the code imposes a duty
to act only when the defendant is capable of the action the law requires
of him.

We discuss exactly what that might mean in the context of the *Likine*
case, below.

 

### MPC Section 2.01(3)

Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an
omission unaccompanied by action unless:

\(a\) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the
offense; or

\(b\) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.

 

 

 

2.1.2.5

People v. Likine

 

This case involves an important caveat to the concept of liability for
omissions: the idea that one cannot fairly be held accountable for
failing to do that which she was not capable of doing.

We will return to the concept of impossibility as a defense later in the
semester, principally when we cover the law of criminal attempts. For
now, consider the fairness of holding someone responsible for not doing
an act she was not physically capable of acomplishing? Does Likine fall
into that category?

 

### *People v. Likine*

Supreme Court of Michigan

823 N.W.2d 50 (Mich. 2012)

 

All defendants argue that the circuit courts denied their constitutional
right to due process when they refused to consider evidence of
defendants\' "inability to pay" as a defense to the charge of felony
nonsupport. Only Likine explicitly equated her alleged inability to pay
with a claim of impossibility.

To evaluate defendants\' arguments, we must first consider the relevant
statute, MCL 750.165.28 The operative language of the statute provides
that "\[i\]f the court orders an individual to pay support \... for a
child of the individual, and the individual does not pay the support
\..., the individual is guilty of a felony\...."

We agree with the Court of Appeals\' conclusion 750.165 imposes strict
liability. Although strict-liability offenses are disfavored, there is
no question that the Legislature may create such offenses without
running afoul of constitutional concerns. Consistently with \[*People v.
Adams*, 262 Mich.App. 89, 683 N.W.2d 729 (2004)\], we have stated that
strict-liability crimes "regulate\[ \] conduct under the state\'s police
power to promote the social good, a course the Legislature may elect
without requiring mens rea," which is a particular state of mind that
the prosecution must prove the defendant had in order to secure a
conviction.

Concluding that MCL 750.165 is a strict-liability offense, however, does
not end our analysis. The *Adams* Court only addressed the defense of
inability to pay and did not address the common-law defense of
impossibility, which if proven negates the actus reus of a crime.
Generally, the commission of a crime requires both an actus reus and a
mens rea. Though a strict-liability crime includes no mens rea element,
the actus reus, or wrongful act, remains an element of the crime.
Specifically, a strict-liability offense requires the prosecution to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the
prohibited act, regardless of the defendant\'s intent and regardless of
what the defendant actually knew or did not know.

A defendant might defend against a strict-liability crime by submitting
proofs either that the act never occurred or that the defendant was not
the wrongdoer. Additionally, at common law, a defendant could admit that
he committed the act, but defend on the basis that the act was committed
involuntarily. Examples of involuntary acts that, if proved, provide a
defense against the actus reus element of a crime include reflexive
actions, spasms, seizures or convulsions, and bodily movements occurring
while the actor is unconscious or asleep. The common thread running
through these "involuntariness" defenses is that the act does not occur
under the defendant\'s control, and thus the defendant was powerless to
prevent its occurrence and cannot be held criminally liable for the act.

MCL 750.165, however, criminalizes an omission, or a failure to act. At
common law, an established defense to a crime of omission is
impossibility. Like its counterpart, involuntariness, the centuries-old
defense of impossibility derives from the English common-law courts. For
example, in 1843, the Queen\'s Bench considered a defendant\'s liability
for failing to repair a portion of highway that had been rendered
impassable when the surrounding sea encroached. The Chief Judge stated:

Both the road which the defendant is charged with liability to repair,
and the land over which it passes, are washed away by the sea. To
restore the road, as \[the defendant\] is required to do, he  must
create a part of the earth anew. . . here all the material of which a
road could be made have been swept away by the act of God. Under those
circumstances can the defendant be liable for not repairing the road? We
want an authority for such a proposition; and none has been found.

The Queen\'s Bench, then, recognized impossibility of performance as a
defense to a charge involving an omission. Like the involuntariness
defense to crimes that penalize an affirmative act, the defense of
impossibility to crimes that penalize an act of omission must be based
on something outside the defendant\'s control:

Obviously, the involuntariness of omissions cannot be explained in
precisely the same way as for actions. It would be odd indeed to talk of
a reflex or convulsive omission. Nonetheless, even for omissions the
criminal law requires that \[a defendant\] must be responsible for her
behavior before she commits the actus reus of a crime. \[The
defendant\'s\] omission is involuntary, and her responsibility for the
actus reus is negated, when she fails to discharge a duty to intervene
because it was impossible for her to do so.

Stated differently, a defendant cannot be held criminally liable for
failing to perform an act that was impossible for the defendant to
perform. When it is genuinely impossible for a defendant to discharge a
duty imposed by law, the defendant\'s failure is excused.

Michigan common law, which has its roots in the English common law, has
also long recognized impossibility as a defense to crimes of omission.
In *Port Huron v. Jenkinson*, this Court considered a city ordinance
that criminalized a property owner\'s failure to repair sidewalks
running adjacent to his or her property if the city requested the
property owner to make the repair. *Jenkinson* recognized impossibility
as a defense, holding that the defendant could not be criminally
convicted of failing to perform a legally required duty when it was
impossible for him to do so. The Court in *Jenkinson* stated:

No legislative or municipal body has the power to impose the duty of
performing an act upon any person which it is impossible for him to
perform, and then make his non-performance of such a duty a crime, for
which he may be punished by both fine and imprisonment. It needs no
argument to convince any court or citizen, where law prevails, that this
cannot be done; and yet such is the effect of the provisions of the
statute and by-law under consideration. It will readily be seen that a
tenant occupying a house and lot in the city of Port Huron, and so poor
and indigent as to receive support from his charitable neighbors, if
required by the city authorities to build or repair a sidewalk along the
street in front of the premises he occupies, and fails to comply with
such request, such omission becomes criminal; and, upon conviction of
the offense, he may be fined and imprisoned. It is hardly necessary to
say these two sections of the statute are unconstitutional and void, and
that the provisions are of no force or effect. They are obnoxious to our
Constitution and laws; and the two sections of the statute are a
disgrace to the legislation of the State.

The Court specifically held that a legislative body cannot require a
person to perform an act that "is impossible for him to perform" and
then impose criminal penalties for the failure to perform that act.
*Jenkinson*, then, recognized common-law impossibility as a defense to a
criminal omission.

The language of MCL 750.165 provides no indication that the Legislature
intended to abrogate common-law impossibility as a defense to felony
nonsupport. Consistently with the Michigan Constitution and absent a
clear legislative intent to abolish the common law, we thus presume that
the common-law defense of impossibility remains available if supported
by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, we hold that genuine impossibility
is a defense to the charge of felony nonsupport under  MCL 750.165.62
Just as a defendant cannot be held criminally liable for committing an
act that he or she was powerless to prevent, so, too, a defendant cannot
be held criminally liable for failing to perform an act that was
genuinely impossible for the defendant to perform.

In considering the parameters of the impossibility defense, we find
instructive the United States Supreme Court\'s decision in *Bearden v.
Georgia*, which considered the constitutionality of revoking a criminal
defendant\'s probation for failure to pay a fine. In *Bearden*, the
petitioner was ordered to pay a \$500 fine and \$250 in restitution as
conditions of his probation. He was then laid off from his job and,
despite repeated efforts, was unable to find other work. When the
petitioner\'s remaining payments were late, the state revoked his
probation because he had not paid the balance. The record from the
probation-revocation hearing indicated that the petitioner had been
unable to find employment and had no assets or income. The Court held
that if a fine is determined to be the appropriate penalty for a crime,
the state cannot "imprison a person solely because he lacked the
resources to pay it." Rather, there must be "evidence and findings that
the defendant was somehow responsible for the failure\...." *Bearden*
directed sentencing courts to consider the reasons for nonpayment and
carefully "inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay":

This distinction, based on the reasons for nonpayment, is of critical
importance here. If the probationer has willfully refused to pay the
fine or restitution when he has the means to pay, the State is perfectly
justified in using imprisonment as a sanction to enforce collection.
Similarly, a probationer\'s failure to make sufficient bona fide efforts
to seek employment or borrow money in order to pay the fine or
restitution may reflect an insufficient concern for paying the debt he
owes to society for his crime. In such a situation, the State is
likewise justified in revoking probation and using imprisonment as an
appropriate penalty for the offense.

*Bearden* indicated that "if the probationer has made all reasonable
efforts to pay the fine or restitution, and yet cannot do so through no
fault of his own, it is fundamentally unfair to revoke probation
automatically\...." The Court held that a "lack of fault provides a
'substantial reason which justifies or mitigates the violation' and
makes revocation inappropriate."

We recognize that the Court in *Bearden* dealt with probation revocation
for nonpayment of a fine, as opposed to the felony nonsupport at issue
in this case, but we are guided by the Court\'s reasoning, which
inquires into and considers an individual\'s efforts to make a legally
required payment. Thus, we hold that to establish an impossibility
defense for felony nonsupport, a defendant must show that he or she
acted in good faith and made all reasonable efforts to comply with the
family court order, but could not do so through no fault of his or her
own. In our view, "sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment or
borrow money in order to pay" certainly are expected, but standing alone
will not necessarily establish an impossibility defense to a charge
under MCL 750.165. Instead, defendants charged with felony nonsupport
must make all reasonable efforts, and use all resources at their
disposal, to comply with their support obligations. For the payment of
child support to be truly impossible, a defendant must explore and
eliminate all the reasonably possible, lawful avenues of obtaining the
revenue required to comply with the support order. Defendants must not
only establish that they cannot pay, but that theirs are among the
exceptional cases in which it was not reasonably possible to obtain the
resources to pay. A defendant\'s failure to undertake those efforts
reflects "an insufficient concern for paying the debt" one owes to
one\'s child, which arises from the individual\'s responsibility as a
parent.

To determine whether a defendant has established impossibility in the
context of a felony nonsupport case, we provide, for illustrative
purposes only, a nonexhaustive list of factors for courts to consider.
These should include whether the defendant has diligently sought
employment; whether the defendant can secure additional employment, such
as a second job; whether the defendant has investments that can be
liquidated; whether the defendant has received substantial gifts or an
inheritance; whether the defendant owns a home that can be refinanced;
whether the defendant has assets that can be sold or used as loan
collateral; whether the defendant prioritized the payment of child
support over the purchase of nonessential, luxury, or otherwise
extravagant items; and whether the defendant has taken reasonable
precautions to guard against financial misfortune and has arranged his
or her financial affairs with future contingencies in mind, in
accordance with one\'s parental responsibility to one\'s child. The
existence of unexplored possibilities for generating income for payment
of the court-ordered support suggests that a defendant has not raised a
true impossibility defense, but merely an assertion of inability to pay.
A defendant\'s failure to explore every reasonably possible avenue in
order to pay his or her support obligation not only reflects "an
insufficient concern for paying the debt he owes to society," it also
reflects an insufficient concern for the child. In those instances, the
defendant may not invoke the shield of the impossibility defense.

 

 

 

2.1.3

Act or Omission

 

The cases thus far have provided a sharp contrast. If a defendant is
charged with acting to cause a harm, one set of rules applies; if he is
charged with causing a harm through his failure to act, a different set
of rules applies. But the line between act and omission is not always so
sharp. The *Barber* case shows how important issue framing (and creative
lawyering) can be in this area. How does the court describe the
cessation of life support in this case? Is that a fair (or accurate)
description of what occurred?

 

 

 

 

2.1.3.1

Barber v. Superior Court

 

### *Barber v. Superior Court*

Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 2, California

195 Cal. Rptr 484 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1983)

 

Deceased Clarence Herbert underwent surgery for closure of an ileostomy.
Petitioner Robert Nejdl, M.D., was Mr. Herbert's surgeon and petitioner
Neil Barber, M.D., was his attending internist. Shortly after the
successful completion of the surgery, and while in the recovery room,
Mr. Herbert suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest. He was revived by a
team of physicians and nurses and immediately placed on life support
equipment.

Within the following three days, it was determined that Mr. Herbert was
in a deeply comatose state from which he was not likely to recover.
Tests and examinations performed by several physicians, including
petitioners herein, each specializing in relevant fields of medicine
indicated that Mr. Herbert had suffered severe brain damage, leaving him
in a vegetative state, which was likely to be permanent.

At that time petitioners informed Mr. Herbert's family of their opinion
as to his condition and chances for recovery. While there is some
dispute as to the precise terminology used by the doctors, it is clear
that they communicated to the family that the prognosis for recovery was
extremely poor. At that point, the family convened and drafted a written
request to the hospital personnel stating that they wanted "all machines
taken off that are sustaining life" *(sic).* As a result, petitioners,
either directly or as a result of orders given by them, caused the
respirator and other life-sustaining equipment to be removed. Mr.
Herbert continued to breathe without the equipment but showed no signs
of improvement. The family remained at his bedside and requested of the
nursing staff that Mr. Herbert not be disturbed. They even objected to
certain routine procedures followed by hospital personnel in caring for
comatose patients.

After two more days had elapsed, petitioners, after consulting with the
family, ordered removal of the intravenous tubes which provided
hydration and nourishment. From that point until his death, Mr. Herbert
received nursing care which preserved his dignity and provided a clean
and hygienic environment.

The precise issue for determination by this court is whether the
evidence presented before the magistrate was sufficient to support his
determination that petitioners should not be held to answer to the
charges of murder (Pen. Code, § 187) and conspiracy to commit murder
(Pen. Code, § 182).

Murder is the *unlawful* killing of a human being, . . . with malice
aforethought." (Pen. Code, § 187, italics added.) Malice may be express
or implied. It is express when there is an intent *unlawfully* to take
any life. It is implied when the circumstances show an abandoned and
malignant heart. (Pen. Code, § 188.)

Of course the term homicide simply connotes the death of an individual
at the hands of another. In any homicide the end result is the same---
the death of a human being. Whether or not a homicide is punishable as a
crime in the first instance, and the degree of punishment which is
imposed in the case of a criminal homicide depends upon the mental
culpability of the person causing the death.

We deal here with the physician's responsibility in a case of a patient
who, though not "brain dead," faces an indefinite vegetative existence
without any of the higher cognitive brain functions. As one court stated
the issue: "Now, however, we are on the threshold of new terrain---the
penumbra where death begins but life, in some form, continues. We have
been led to it by the medical miracles which now compel us to
distinguish between 'death,' as we have known it, and death in which the
body lives in some fashion but the brain (or a significant part of it)
does not." *(Severns* *v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc.* (Del. 1980)
421 A.2d 1334, 1344.)

Because of the current gap between technology and law, physicians and
families of these unfortunate victims are called upon to make intensely
painful and personal decisions regarding their care without clearly
defined legal guidelines.

As a predicate to our analysis of whether the petitioners' conduct
amounted to an "unlawful killing," we conclude that the cessation of
"heroic" life support measures is not an affirmative act but rather a
withdrawal or omission of further treatment.

Even though these life support devices are, to a degree,
"self-propelled," each pulsation of the respirator or each drop of fluid
introduced into the patient's body by intravenous feeding devices is
comparable to a manually administered injection or item of medication.
Hence "disconnecting" of the mechanical devices is comparable to
withholding the manually administered injection or medication.

Further, we view the use of an intravenous administration of nourishment
and fluid, under the circumstances, as being the same as the use of the
respirator or other form of life support equipment.

The prosecution would have us draw a distinction between the use of
mechanical breathing devices such as respirators and mechanical feeding
devices such as intravenous tubes. The distinction urged seems to be
based more on the emotional symbolism of providing food and water to
those incapable of providing for themselves rather than on any rational
difference in cases such as the one at bench

*Medical* nutrition and hydration may not always provide net benefits to
patients. Medical procedures to provide nutrition and hydration are more
similar to other medical procedures than to typical human ways of
providing nutrition and hydration. Their benefits and burdens ought to
be evaluated in the same manner as any other medical procedure.

In the final analysis, since we view petitioners' conduct as that of
omission rather than affirmative action, the resolution of this case
turns on whether petitioners had a duty to continue to provide life
sustaining treatment.

There is no criminal liability for failure to act unless there is a
legal duty to act. (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, § 67, p. 71.) Thus the
critical issue becomes one of determining the duties owed by a physician
to a patient who has been reliably diagnosed as in a comatose state from
which any meaningful recovery of cognitive brain function is exceedingly
unlikely.

A physician has no duty to continue treatment once it has proved to be
ineffective. Although there may be a duty to provide life-sustaining
machinery in the *immediate* aftermath of a cardio-respiratory arrest,
there is no duty to continue its use once it has become futile in the
opinion of qualified medical personnel.

"A physician is authorized under the standards of medical practice to
discontinue a form of therapy which in his medical judgment is useless.
. . . If the treating physicians have determined that continued use of a
respirator is useless, then they may decide to discontinue it without
fear of civil or criminal liability. By useless is meant that the
continued use of the therapy cannot and does not improve the prognosis
for recovery."

The evidence presented at the preliminary hearing supports the
conclusion that petitioners reasonably concluded that Mr. Herbert had
virtually no chance of recovering his cognitive or motor functions. The
most optimistic prognosis provided by any of the testifying experts was
that the patient had an excellent chance of "recovery." However,
recovery was defined in terms of a spectrum running from a persistent
vegetative state to full recovery. A persistent vegetative state was
described as that state in which the patient would have\" no contact
with the environment but parts of the brain would continue to live. The
doctor who was of course approaching the case after the fact and from a
hindsight view, was unable to predict where on this continuum Mr.
Herbert was likely to end up. Several studies on which the expert
relied, however, indicated that the chances for unimpaired or full
recovery were miniscule. The results of these studies coincided with the
diagnoses of the physicians who had actually examined and dealt with the
patient before his demise.

In summary we conclude that the petitioners' omission to continue
treatment under the circumstances, though intentional and with knowledge
that the patient would die, was not an unlawful failure to perform a
legal duty. In view of our decision on that issue, it becomes
unnecessary to deal with the further issue of whether petitioners'
conduct was in fact the proximate cause of Mr. Herbert's ultimate death.

The evidence amply supports the magistrate's conclusion. The superior
court erred in determining that as a matter of law the evidence required
the magistrate to hold petitioners to answer.

Let a peremptory writ of prohibition issue to restrain the Superior
Court of Los Angeles County from taking any further action in this
matter other than to vacate its order reinstating the complaint and
enter a new and different order denying the People's motion under Penal
Code section 871.5.

 

 

 

2.2

Mens Rea

 

Mens rea---a guilty mind---is the second part of criminal culpability,
and undoubtedly one of the most complex subjects we will study in this
course. When we speak of mens rea, we mean a culpable mental state \--
usually intent, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence. We can speak of
mens rea either generally \-- does this statute require *some* culpable
mental state be proven? \-- or specifically \-- did this defendant act
with the mental state required by this statute?\
\
This section, more than the last, will contrast the traditional,
sometimes messy approach that common law courts took to mens rea with
the careful but sometimes opaque approach of the Model Penal Code.

 

 

 

 

2.2.1

The Basic Task

 

In a perfect world, legislatures would spell out quite clearly what mens
rea is required for every element of every offense they create. Because
legislatures rarely write their codes from scratch, choosing instead to
adopt ancient formulations of traditional crimes, they often fall short
of this mark.

Thus, much of our task in analyzing statutes will be determining exactly
what a particular statute prohibits. Although it is not always clear
from the reported cases, the principal task in interpreting criminal
statutes and adjudicating a defendant\'s guilt is always the same.

-   First, we must determine what the elements of the charged offense
    are and what mens rea is required as to each of them.

-   Second, we examine the defendant\'s conduct and determine whether or
    not the state has proven that he did the prohibited acts with the
    necessary mens rea. If, and only if, the government has proven all
    of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt may the defendant be
    convicted of the charged offense.

 

 

 

 

2.2.1.1

Regina v. Cunningham

 

Regina v. Cunningham is a classic case of a court struggling to define
mens rea terms and to explain them to a jury. We read it to contrast the
older, difficult language of the opinion with the newer, hopefully
clearer language of modern courts and statutes.

 

### *Regina v. Cunningham*

Court of Criminal Appeal

2 Q.B. 396 (1957)

 

BYRNE J. read the following judgment. The appellant was convicted at
Leeds Assizes upon an indictment framed under section 23 of the Offences
against the Person Act, 1861, which charged that he unlawfully and
maliciously caused to be taken by Sarah Wade a certain noxious thing,
namely, coal gas, so as thereby to endanger the life of the said Sarah
Wade.

The facts were that the appellant was engaged to be married and his
prospective mother-­in-law was the tenant of a house, No. 7A, Bakes
Street, Bradford, which was unoccupied, but which was to be occupied by
the appellant after his marriage. Mrs. Wade and her husband, an elderly
couple, lived in the house next door. At one time the two houses had
been one, but when the building was converted into two houses a wall had
been erected to divide the cellars of the two houses, and that wall was
composed of rubble loosely cemented.

On the evening of January 17, 1957, the appellant went the cellar of No.
7A, Bakes Street, wrenched the gas meter from the gas pipes and stole
it, together with its contents, and in a second indictment he was
charged with the larceny of the gas meter and its contents. To that
indictment he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months
imprisonment. In respect of that matter he does not appeal.

The facts were not really in dispute, and in a statement to a police
officer the appellant said: "All right, I will tell you. I was short of
money, I had been off work for three days, I got eight shillings from
the gas meter. I tore it the wall and threw it away.\" Although there
was a stop tap within two feet of the meter the appellant did not turn
off the gas, with the result that a very considerable volume of gas
escaped, some of which seeped through the wall of the cellar and
partially asphyxiated Mrs. Wade, who was asleep in her bedroom next
door, with the result that her life was endangered.

At the close of the case for the prosecution, Mr. Brodie, who appeared
for the appellant at the trial and who has appeared for him again in
this court submitted that there was no case to go to the jury, but the
judge, quite rightly in our opinion, rejected this submission. The
appellant did not give evidence.

The act of the appellant was clearly unlawful and therefore the real
question for the jury was whether it was also malicious within the
meaning of section 23 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.

Before this court Mr. Brodie has taken three points, all dependent upon
the construction of that section. Section 23 provides:

Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously administer to or cause to be
administered to or taken by any other person any poison or other
destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger the life of such
person, or so as thereby to inflict upon such person any grievous bodily
harm, shall be guilty of felony . . .

Mr. Brodie argued, first, that mens rea of some kind is necessary.
Secondly, that the nature of the mens rea required is that the appellant
must intend to do the particular kind of harm that was done, or,
alternatively, that he must foresee that that harm may occur yet
nevertheless continue recklessly to do the act. Thirdly, that the judge
misdirected the jury as to the meaning of the word \"maliciously."

We have considered \[the cases submitted by the defendant as well as\]
the following principle which was propounded by the late Professor C. S.
Kenny in the first edition of his Outlines of Criminal Law published in
1902 and repeated at p. 186 of the 16th edition edited by Mr. J. W.
Cecil Turner and published in 1952:

In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in the
old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either (1) An
actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was
done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not
(i.e., the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might
be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It is neither
limited to nor does it indeed require any ill will towards the person
injured.

We think that this is an accurate statement of the law. In our opinion
the word maliciously in a statutory crime postulates foresight of
consequence.

In his summing-up Oliver J. directed the jury as follows:

You will observe that there is nothing there about \'with intention that
that person should take it.\' He has not got to intend that it should be
taken; it is sufficient that by his unlawful and malicious act he causes
it to be taken. What you have to decide here, then, is whether, when he
loosed that frightful cloud of coal gas into the house which he shared
with this old lady, he caused her to take it by his unlawful and
malicious action. \'Unlawful\' does not need any definition. It is
something forbidden by law. What about \'malicious\'? \'Malicious\' for
this purpose means wicked \-- something which he has no business to do
and perfectly well knows it. \'Wicked\' is as good a definition as any
other which you would get.

The facts which face you (and they are uncontradicted and undisputed;
the prisoner has not gone into the box to seek to give any particular
explanation) are these. Living in the house, which was now two houses
but which had once been one and had been rather roughly divided, the
prisoner quite deliberately, intending to steal the money that was in
the meter . . . broke the gas meter away from the supply pipes and thus
released the mains supply of gas at large into that house. When he did
that he knew that this old lady and her husband were living next door to
him. The gas meter was in a cellar. The wall which divided his cellar
from the cellar next door was a kind of honeycomb wall through which gas
could very well go, so that when he loosed that cloud of gas into that
place he must have known perfectly well that gas would percolate all
over the house. If it were part of this offense - which it is not -that
he intended to poison the old lady, I should have left it to you to
decide, and I should have told you that there was evidence on which you
could find that he intended that, since he did an action which he must
have known would result in that. As I have already told you, it is not
necessary to prove that he intended to do it; it is quite enough that
what he did was done unlawfully and maliciously.

With the utmost respect to the learned judge, we think it is incorrect
to say that the word \"malicious\" in a statutory offence merely means
wicked. We think the judge was, in effect, telling the jury that if they
were satisfied that the appellant acted wickedly - and he had clearly
acted wickedly in stealing the gas meter and its contents - they ought
to find that he had acted maliciously in causing the gas to be taken by
Mrs. Wade so as thereby to endanger her life.

In our view it should have been left to the jury to decide whether, even
if the appellant did not intend the injury to Mrs. Wade, he foresaw that
the removal of the gas meter might cause injury to someone but
nevertheless removed it. We are unable to say that a reasonable jury,
properly directed as to the meaning of the word maliciously in the
context of section 23, would without doubt have convicted.

In these circumstances this court has no alternative but to allow the
appeal and quash the conviction.

 

 

 

2.2.1.2

MPC Section 2.02

 

Section 2.02 sets forth the MPC\'s approach to mens rea analysis. It is
one of the most important documents in this course and should be read
multiple times and with great care.

It is also almost impossible to comprehend on first (or even tenth)
reading. Don\'t be put off if you don\'t grasp it prior to class. As
with all of the materials we cover, it requires very careful parsing and
thought. You shoudl definitely return to it after class and see whether
it makes more sense after we have discussed it together.

 

### MPC § 2.02 General Requirements of Culpability.

\(1\) Minimum Requirements of Culpability. Except as provided in Section
2.05, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely,
knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with
respect to each material element of the offense.

\(2\) Kinds of Culpability Defined.

\(a\) Purposely.

A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense
when:

\(i\) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result
thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature
or to cause such a result; and

\(ii\) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware
of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they
exist.

\(b\) Knowingly.

A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense
when

\(i\) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant
circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that
such circumstances exist; and

\(ii\) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that
it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.

\(c\) Recklessly.

A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an
offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.
The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the
nature and purpose of the actor\'s conduct and the circumstances known
to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of
conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor\'s
situation.

\(d\) Negligently.

A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an
offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk
that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The
risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor\'s failure to
perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the
circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard
of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\'s
situation.

\(3\) Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided. When the
culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is
not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts
purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.

\(4\) Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material
Elements. When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of
culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without
distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall
apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary
purpose plainly appears.

\(5\) Substitutes for Negligence, Recklessness and Knowledge. When the
law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an
offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely,
knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an
element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely or
knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such
element also is established if a person acts purposely.

\(6\) Requirement of Purpose Satisfied if Purpose Is Conditional. When a
particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is
established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition
negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining
the offense.

\(7\) Requirement of Knowledge Satisfied by Knowledge of High
Probability. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an
element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is
aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually
believes that it does not exist.

\(8\) Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A
requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is satisfied if a
person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the
offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements appears.

\(9\) Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct. Neither knowledge nor
recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense
or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining
the elements of an offense is an element of such offense, unless the
definition of the offense or the Code so provides.

\(10\) Culpability as Determinant of Grade of Offense. When the grade or
degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed
purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, its grade or degree
shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is
established with respect to any material element of the offense.

 

 

 

2.2.1.3

Official Comment to Section 2.02(1)

 

### Commentary to 2.02(1)

Subsection (1) articulates the Code's insistence that an element of
culpability is requisite for any valid criminal conviction and that the
concepts of purpose, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence suffice to
delineate the kinds of culpability that may be called for in the
definition of specific crimes. The only exception to this general
requirement is the narrow allowance for offenses of strict liability in
Section 2.05, limited to cases where no severer sentence than a fine may
be imposed.

The requirement of culpability applies to each "material element" of the
crime. The term "material element" is defined in Section 1.13(10) to
encompass only matters relating to the harm or evil sought to be
prevented by the law defining an offense or to the existence of a
justification or excuse for the actor's conduct. Facts that relate to
other matters, such as jurisdiction, venue, or limitations are not
"material" within this definition.

Which of the four kinds of culpability suffices to establish a
particular material element of a particular offense is determined either
by the definition of the offense or by the other provisions of this
section.

 

 

 

2.2.1.4

Notes on Terminology

 

A few notes about phrases used in this section.

 

First, the MPC distinguishes between material and non-material elements.
§ 2.02(1) tells us that with respect to every material element, some
mens rea must be proven by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.
Determining exactly which mens rea must be proven with regard to each
element is a question we will address next week. By contrast, with
respect to non-material elements no mens rea need be proven. What is a
non-material element? The MPC in § 1.13(10) defines a material element
as "an element that does not relate exclusively to the statute of
limitations, jurisdiction, venue or to any other matter similarly
unconnected with ... the harm or evil, incident to conduct, sought to be
prevented by the law defining the offense." So, for example, when we
discussed the Colorado model jury instructions, it was an element of
each offense that the conduct occurred in the state of Colorado. Is that
a material element of the offense?

Second, the Model Penal Code divides elements into conduct, attendant
circumstances, and results. These differences are less crucial than the
distinction made between material and non-material elements. As we've
seen § 2.02(2) changes the definitions of the four mens rea terms
slightly based on what kind of element we are talking about. This is
largely because a defendant can know with certainty whether or not it is
night time (an attendant circumstance) but with regard to a result that
might occur in the future (such as the death of another person) the most
he can be is virtually certain that it will occur.

These two distinctions (between material and non-material elements and
among the various kinds of elements) are largely independent of each
other. So, some attendant circumstances (that the person with whom the
defendant had sex is under the age of consent, say) are material while
others (the event occurred in Colorado) are not.

 

 

 

2.2.1.5

Examples for Applying Section 2.02

 

Consider applying the interpretative tools of the Section 2.02
(partiularly subsections (3) and (4)) to each of the following statutes.
Using these rules, what mens rea is required for each element of each
offense?

 

### Colorado Penal Code examples

Robbery Section 18-4-301

A person who knowingly takes anything of value from the person or
presence of another by the use of force, threats, or intimidation
commits robbery.

Arson Section 18-4-102

A person who knowingly sets fire to, burns, causes to be burned, or by
the use of any explosive damages or destroys, or causes to be damaged or
destroyed, any building or occupied structure of another without his
consent commits first degree arson.

Stalking Section 18-3-602

A person commits stalking if directly, or indirectly through another
person, the person knowingly:

(a)   Makes a credible threat to another person and, in connection with
the threat, repeatedly follows, approaches, contacts, or places under
surveillance that person, a member of that person\'s immediate family,
or someone with whom that person has or has had a continuing
relationship.

### Examples from Elsewhere

Destruction of Property (DC Code Ann. Setion 22-303 (2016)

Whoever maliciously injures or breaks or destroys, or attempts to injure
or break or destroy, by fire or otherwise, any public or private
property, whether real or personal, not his or her own, of the value of
\$1,000 or more, shall be fined not more than \$25,000 or shall be
imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.

Destruction of Property (NY Penal Law Section 145.10 (2016)

A person is guilty of criminal mischief in the second degree when with
intent to damage property of another person, and having no right to do
so nor any reasonable ground to believe that he has such right, he
damages property of another person in an amount exceeding one thousand
five hundred dollars.

 

 

 

2.2.2

The Mens Rea Terms

 

The MPC had an enormous influence on clarifying the meaning of mens rea
terms which were already in wide usage. In this section we look at some
of these terms in depth, investigating the boundries between them and
the difficulties of proof that they raise.

### *United States v. Jewell*

United States Court of Appeals

532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir. 1976)

 

It is undisputed that appellant entered the United States driving an
automobile in which 110 pounds of marihuana worth \$6,250 had been
concealed in a secret compartment between the trunk and rear seat.
Appellant testified that he did not know the marihuana was present.
There was circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer that
appellant had positive knowledge of the presence of the marihuana, and
that his contrary testimony was false. On the other hand there was
evidence from which the jury could conclude that appellant spoke the
truth --- that although appellant knew of the presence of the secret
compartment and had knowledge of facts indicating that it contained
marijuana, he deliberately avoided positive knowledge of the presence of
the contraband to avoid responsibility in the event of discovery. If the
jury concluded the latter was indeed the situation, and if positive
knowledge is required to convict, the jury would have no choice
consistent with its oath but to find appellant not guilty even though he
deliberately contrived his lack of positive knowledge. Appellant urges
this view. The trial court rejected the premise that only positive
knowledge would suffice, and properly so.

Appellant tendered an instruction that to return a guilty verdict the
jury must find that the defendant knew he was in possession of
marihuana. The trial judge rejected the instruction because it suggested
that \"absolutely, positively, he has to know that it\'s there.\" The
court said, \"I think, in this case, it\'s not too sound an instruction
because we have evidence that if the jury believes it, they\'d be
justified in finding he actually didn\'t know what it was --- he didn\'t
because he didn\'t want to find it.\"

The court instructed the jury that \"knowingly\" meant voluntarily and
intentionally and not by accident or mistake. The court told the jury
that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant \"knowingly\" brought the marihuana into the United States
(count 1: 21 U.S.C. § 952(a)), and that he \"knowingly\" possessed the
marihuana (Count 2: 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)). The court continued:

The Government can complete their burden of proof by proving, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that if the defendant was not actually aware that
there was marijuana in the vehicle he was driving when he entered the
United States his ignorance in that regard was solely and entirely a
result of his having made a conscious purpose to disregard the nature of
that which was in the vehicle, with a conscious purpose to avoid
learning the truth.

The legal premise of these instructions is firmly supported by leading
commentators here and in England. Professor Rollin M. Perkins writes,
\"One with a deliberate anti-social purpose in mind . . . may
deliberately \'shut his eyes\' to avoid knowing what would otherwise be
obvious to view. In such cases, so far as criminal law is concerned, the
person acts at his peril in this regard, and is treated as having
\'knowledge\' of the facts as they are ultimately discovered to be.\" J.
Ll. J. Edwards, writing in 1954, introduced a survey of English cases
with the statement, \"For well-nigh a hundred years, it has been clear
from the authorities that a person who deliberately shuts his eyes to an
obvious means of knowledge has sufficient *mens rea* for an offence
based on such words as . . . \'knowingly.\'\" Professor Glanville
Williams states, on the basis both English and American authorities,
\"To the requirement of actual knowledge there is one strictly limited
exception. . . . \[T\]he rule is that if a party has his suspicion
aroused but then deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because
he wishes to remain in ignorance, he is deemed to have knowledge."
Professor Williams concludes, \"The rule that wilful blindness is
equivalent to knowledge is essential, and is found throughout the
criminal law.\"

The substantive justification for the rule is that deliberate ignorance
and positive knowledge are equally culpable. The textual justification
is that in common understanding one \"knows\" facts of which he is less
than absolutely certain. To act \"knowingly,\" therefore, is not
necessarily to act only with positive knowledge, but also to act with an
awareness of the high probability of the existence of the fact in
question. When such awareness is present, \"positive\" knowledge is not
required.

This is the analysis adopted in the Model Penal Code. Section 2.02(7)
states: \"When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an
element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is
aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually
believes that it does not exist.\" As the Comment to this provision
explains, \"Paragraph (7) deals with the situation British commentators
have denominated \'wilful blindness\' or \`connivance,\' the case of the
actor who is aware of the probable existence of a material fact but does
not satisfy himself that it does not in fact exist.\"

\"Deliberate ignorance\" instructions have been approved in prosecutions
under criminal statutes prohibiting \"knowing\" conduct by the Courts of
Appeals of the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits. In many other
cases, Courts of Appeals reviewing the sufficiency of evidence have
approved the premise that \"knowingly\" in criminal statutes is not
limited to positive knowledge, but includes the state of mind of one who
does not possess positive knowledge only because he consciously avoided
it. These lines of authority appear unbroken. Neither the dissent nor
the briefs of either party has cited a case holding that such an
instruction is error or that such evidence is not sufficient to
establish \"knowledge.\"

There is no reason to reach a different result under the statute
involved in this case. Doing so would put this court in direct conflict
with Courts of Appeals in two other circuits that have approved
\"deliberate ignorance\" instructions in prosecutions under 21 U.S.C. §
841(a), or its predecessor, 21 U.S.C. § 174. Nothing is cited from the
legislative history of the Drug Control Act indicating that Congress
used the term \"knowingly\" in a sense at odds with prior authority.
Rather, Congress is presumed to have known and adopted the \"cluster of
ideas\" attached to such a familiar term of art. *Morissette v. United
States,* 342 U.S. 246, 263, (1952).

Appellant\'s narrow interpretation of \"knowingly\" is inconsistent with
the Drug Control Act\'s general purpose to deal more effectively \"with
the growing menace of drug abuse in the United States.\" Holding that
this term introduces a requirement of positive knowledge would make
deliberate ignorance a defense. It cannot be doubted that those who
traffic in drugs would make the most of it. This is evident from the
number of appellate decisions reflecting conscious avoidance of positive
knowledge of the presence of contraband --- in the car driven by the
defendant or in which he is a passenger, in the suitcase or package he
carries, in the parcel concealed in his clothing.

It is no answer to say that in such cases the fact finder may infer
positive knowledge. It is probable that many who performed the
transportation function, essential to the drug traffic, can truthfully
testify that they have no *positive* knowledge of the load they carry.
Under appellant\'s interpretation of the statute, such persons will be
convicted only if the fact finder errs in evaluating the credibility of
the witness or deliberately disregards the law.

It begs the question to assert that a \"deliberate ignorance\"
instruction permits the jury to convict without finding that the accused
possessed the knowledge required by the statute. Such an assertion
assumes that the statute requires positive knowledge. But the question
is the meaning of the term \"knowingly\" in the statute. If it means
positive knowledge, then, of course, nothing less will do. But if
\"knowingly\" includes a mental state in which the defendant is aware
that the fact in question is highly probable but consciously avoids
enlightenment, the statute is satisfied by such proof.

It is worth emphasizing that the required state of mind differs from
positive knowledge only so far as necessary to encompass a calculated
effort to avoid the sanctions of the statute while violating its
substance. \"A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it
can almost be said that the defendant actually knew.\" In the language
of the instruction in this case, the government must prove, \"beyond a
reasonable doubt, that if the defendant was not actually aware . . . his
ignorance in that regard was *solely* and *entirely* a result of . . . a
conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.\"

No legitimate interest of an accused is prejudiced by such a standard,
and society\'s interest in a system of criminal law that is enforceable
and that imposes sanctions upon all who are equally culpable requires
it.

The conviction is affirmed.

ANTHONY M. KENNEDY, Circuit Judge, with whom ELY, HUFSTEDLER and
WALLACE, Circuit Judges, join (dissenting).

The approach adopted in section 2.02(7) of the Model Penal Code
clarifies, and, in important ways restricts, the English doctrine:

When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high
probability of  its existence, unless he actually believes that it does
not exist.

This provision requires an awareness of a high probability that a fact
exists, not merely a reckless disregard, or a suspicion followed by a
failure to make further inquiry. It also establishes knowledge as a
matter of subjective belief, an important safeguard against diluting the
guilty state of mind required for conviction. It is important to note
that section 2.02(7) is a *definition* of knowledge, not a substitute
for it; as such, it has been cited with approval by the Supreme Court.

In light of the Model Penal Code\'s definition, the \"conscious
purpose\" jury instruction is defective in three respects. First, it
fails to mention the requirement that Jewell have been aware of a high
probability that a controlled substance was in the car. It is not
culpable to form \"a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth\"
unless one is aware of facts indicating a high probability of that
truth. To illustrate, a child given a gift-wrapped package by his mother
while on vacation in Mexico may form a conscious purpose to take it home
without learning what is inside; yet his state of mind is totally
innocent unless he is aware of a high probability that the package
contains a controlled substance. Thus, a conscious purpose instruction
is only proper when coupled with a requirement that one be aware of a
high probability of the truth.

The second defect in the instruction as given is that it did not alert
the jury that Jewell could not be convicted if he \"actually believed\"
there was no controlled substance in the car. The failure to emphasize,
as does the Model Penal Code, that subjective belief is the
determinative factor, may allow a jury to convict on an objective theory
of knowledge --- that a reasonable man should have inspected the car and
would have discovered what was hidden inside. 

Third, the jury instruction clearly states that Jewell could have been
convicted even if found ignorant or \"not actually aware\" that the car
contained a controlled substance. This is unacceptable because true
ignorance, no matter how unreasonable, cannot provide a basis for
criminal liability when the statute requires knowledge. A proper jury
instruction based on the Model Penal Code would be presented as a way of
defining knowledge, and not as an alternative to it.

### *People v. Hall*

Colorado Supreme Court

999 P.2d 207 (Colo. 2000)

 

Justice BENDER delivered the Opinion of the Court.

**I. INTRODUCTION**

We hold that Nathan Hall must stand trial for the crime of reckless
manslaughter. While skiing on Vail mountain, Hall flew off of a knoll
and collided with Allen Cobb, who was traversing the slope below Hall.
Cobb sustained traumatic brain injuries and died as a result of the
collision. The People charged Hall with felony reckless manslaughter.

At a preliminary hearing to determine whether there was probable cause
for the felony count, the county court found that Hall\'s conduct "did
not rise to the level of dangerousness" required under Colorado law to
uphold a conviction for manslaughter, and the court dismissed the
charges.

The charge of reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly
cause \[ \] the death of another person." § 18--3--104(1)(a), 6 C.R.S.
(1999). For his conduct to be reckless, the actor must have consciously
disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death could result
from his actions. See § 18--1--501(8). We hold that, for the purpose of
determining whether a person acted recklessly, a particular result does
not have to be more likely than not to occur for the risk to be
substantial and unjustifiable. A risk must be assessed by reviewing the
particular facts of the individual case and weighing the likelihood of
harm and the degree of harm that would result if it occurs. Whether an
actor consciously disregarded such a risk may be inferred from
circumstances such as the actor\'s knowledge and experience, or from
what a similarly situated reasonable person would have understood about
the risk under the particular circumstances.

**II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

On April 20, 1997, the last day of the ski season, Hall worked as a ski
lift operator on Vail mountain. When he finished his shift and after the
lifts closed, Hall skied down toward the base of the mountain. The
slopes were not crowded.

On the lower part of a run called "Riva Ridge," just below where the
trail intersects with another called "North Face Catwalk," Hall was
skiing very fast, ski tips in the air, his weight back on his skis, with
his arms out to his sides to maintain balance. He flew off of a knoll
and saw people below him, but he was unable to stop or gain control
because of the moguls.

Hall then collided with Cobb, who had been traversing the slope below
Hall. The collision caused major head and brain injuries to Cobb,
killing him. Cobb was taken to Vail Valley Medical Center, where efforts
to resuscitate him failed. Hall\'s blood alcohol level was .009, which
is less than the limit for driving while ability impaired. A test of
Hall\'s blood for illegal drugs was negative.

The People charged Hall with manslaughter (a class 4 felony)1 and
misdemeanor charges that are not relevant to this appeal. At the close
of the prosecution\'s case at the preliminary hearing, the People
requested that, with respect to the manslaughter count, the court
consider the lesser-included charge of criminally negligent homicide (a
class 5 felony).

**III. DISCUSSION**

**B. Manslaughter and Recklessness**

As Colorado\'s criminal code defines recklessness, "A person acts
recklessly when he consciously disregards a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or that circumstance
exists." § 18--1--501(8). Thus, in the case of manslaughter, the
prosecution must show that the defendant\'s conduct caused the death of
another and that the defendant:

1\) consciously disregarded

2\) a substantial and

3\) unjustifiable risk that he would

4\) cause the death of another.

We examine these elements in detail.

Substantial and Unjustifiable Risk

To show that a person acted recklessly, the prosecution must establish
that the person\'s conduct created a "substantial and unjustifiable"
risk. The district court construed some of our earlier cases as
requiring that the risk of death be "at least more likely than not" to
constitute a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death. In
interpreting our cases, the court relied on an erroneous definition of a
"substantial and unjustifiable" risk. Whether a risk is substantial must
be determined by assessing both the likelihood that harm will occur and
the magnitude of the harm should it occur. We hold that whether a risk
is unjustifiable must be determined by assessing the nature and purpose
of the actor\'s conduct relative to how substantial the risk is.
Finally, in order for conduct to be reckless, the risk must be of such a
nature that its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the
standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise.

A risk does not have to be "more likely than not to occur" or "probable"
in order to be substantial. A risk may be substantial even if the chance
that the harm will occur is well below fifty percent. Some risks may be
substantial even if they carry a low degree of probability because the
magnitude of the harm is potentially great. For example, if a person
holds a revolver with a single bullet in one of the chambers, points the
gun at another\'s head and pulls the trigger, then the risk of death is
substantial even though the odds that death will result are no better
than one in six. ....

Whether a risk is substantial is a matter of fact that will depend on
the specific circumstances of each case. Some conduct almost always
carries a substantial risk of death, such as engaging another person in
a fight with a deadly weapon or firing a gun at another. In such
instances, the substantiality of the risk may be evident from the nature
of the defendant\'s conduct and the court will not have to examine the
specific facts in detail.

Other conduct requires a greater inquiry into the facts of the case to
determine whether it creates a substantial risk of death. In *Moore v.
People*, we affirmed a manslaughter conviction where the defendant
kicked the victim to death. 925 P.2d 264, 269 (Colo.1996). While
"kicking another" may not necessarily involve a substantial risk of
death, a trier of fact can find that repeatedly kicking the head and
torso of someone already beaten unconscious can create a substantial
risk of death. Similarly, driving a car is not conduct that by its
nature necessarily involves a substantial risk of death to others, but
after viewing the facts of a particular case closely a court may
determine that the defendant created a substantial risk of death.

A court cannot generically characterize the actor\'s conduct (e.g.,
"driving a truck") in a manner that ignores the specific elements of the
conduct that create a risk (e.g., driving a truck with failing brakes on
a highway). For example, "installing a heater" carries little risk under
normal circumstances. However, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that
improperly wiring a 120--volt heater to a 240--volt circuit, failing to
use a lock nut to connect the heater to the circuit breaker, and using
other faulty installation techniques creates a substantial risk of
"catastrophic fire" and death. Thus, to determine whether the conduct
created a substantial risk of death, a court must inquire beyond the
general nature of the defendant\'s conduct and consider the specific
conduct in which the defendant engaged.

As well as being substantial, a risk must be unjustifiable in order for
a person\'s conduct to be reckless. Whether a risk is justifiable is
determined by weighing the nature and purpose of the actor\'s conduct
against the risk created by that conduct. If a person consciously
disregards a substantial risk of death but does so in order to advance
an interest that justifies such a risk, the conduct is not reckless. For
example, if a surgeon performs an operation on a patient that has a
seventy-five percent chance of killing the patient, but the patient will
certainly die without the operation, then the conduct is justified and
thus not reckless even though the risk is substantial.

In addition to the separate analyses that are applied to determine
whether a risk is both "substantial" and "unjustified," the concept of a
"substantial and unjustifiable risk" implies a risk that constitutes a
gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable law-abiding
person would exercise under the circumstances. Both the Model Penal Code
and the New York Code, which the General Assembly followed in drafting
the Colorado criminal code, expressly define a "substantial and
unjustifiable risk" as one that is a gross deviation from the reasonable
standard of care. A substantial and unjustifiable risk must constitute a
"gross deviation" from the reasonable standard of care in order to
justify the criminal sanctions imposed for criminal negligence or
reckless conduct, as opposed to the kind of deviation from the
reasonable standard of care that results in civil liability for ordinary
negligence. Whether a risk is substantial and unjustified is a question
of fact. Hence, at trial, the trier of fact must determine whether the
facts presented prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the risk was
substantial and unjustified. In the limited context of a preliminary
hearing, the court must determine whether a risk was substantial and
unjustified by considering the evidence presented in the light most
favorable to the prosecution, and the court must ask whether a
reasonable person could "entertain" the belief---though not necessarily
conclude beyond a reasonable doubt---that the defendant\'s conduct was
reckless based on that evidence.

Conscious Disregard

In addition to showing that a person created a substantial and
unjustifiable risk, the prosecution must demonstrate that the actor
"consciously disregarded" the risk in order to prove that she acted
recklessly. A person acts with a conscious disregard of the risk created
by her conduct when she is aware of the risk and chooses to act despite
that risk. The statutory definitions of culpable mental states make
these distinctions clear.

Although recklessness is a less culpable mental state than intentionally
or knowingly, it involves a higher level of culpability than criminal
negligence. Criminal negligence requires that, "through a gross
deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would
exercise," the actor fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that a result will occur or a circumstance exists. § 18--1--501(3).
An actor is criminally negligent when he should have been aware of the
risk but was not, while recklessness requires that the defendant
actually be aware of the risk but disregard it. Thus, even if she should
be, a person who is not actually aware that her conduct creates a
substantial and unjustifiable risk is not acting recklessly.

A court or trier of fact may infer a person\'s subjective awareness of a
risk from the particular facts of a case, including the person\'s
particular knowledge or expertise. For example, a court may infer a
person\'s subjective awareness of the risks created by firing a gun from
the facts that the person served an extended tour of duty in the
military as a rifleman and machine gunner and was instructed by both the
army and his father not to point a gun at another person. A court may
infer from a person\'s extensive training and safety instruction that
the person understood the risks of fire and other "catastrophic dangers"
created by the "slipshod" installation of a baseboard heater.

In addition to the actor\'s knowledge and experience, a court may infer
the actor\'s subjective awareness of a risk from what a reasonable
person would have understood under the circumstances. When a court
infers the defendant\'s subjective awareness of a risk from what a
reasonable person in the circumstances would have known, the court may
consider the perspective of a reasonable person in the situation and
with the knowledge and training of the actor. Although a court can infer
what the defendant actually knew based on what a reasonable person would
have known in the circumstances, a court must not confuse what a
reasonable person would have known in the circumstances with what the
defendant actually knew. Thus, if a defendant engaged in conduct that a
reasonable person would have understood as creating a substantial and
unjustifiable risk of death, the court may infer that the defendant was
subjectively aware of that risk, but the court cannot hold the defendant
responsible if she were actually unaware of a risk that a reasonable
person would have perceived.

Hence, in a reckless manslaughter case, the prosecution must prove that
the defendant acted despite his subjective awareness of a substantial
and unjustifiable risk of death from his conduct. Because absent an
admission by the defendant such awareness cannot be proven directly, the
court or trier of fact may infer the defendant\'s awareness of the risk
from circumstances such as the defendant\'s training, knowledge, and
prior experiences, or from what a reasonable person would have
understood under the circumstances.

Risk of Death

The final element of recklessness requires that the actor consciously
disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk of a particular result,
and in the case of manslaughter the actor must risk causing death to
another person. The risk can be a risk of death to another generally;
the actor does not have to risk death to a specific individual. Cf.
Deskins, 927 P.2d at 373 (finding that defendant engaged in substantial
and unjustifiable risk that any car on the road, not just the one he
hit, might contain children). Because the element of a "substantial and
unjustifiable risk" measures the likelihood and magnitude of the risk
disregarded by the actor, any risk of death will meet the requirement
that the actor, by his conduct, risks death to another. That is, only a
slight risk of death to another person is necessary to meet this
element.

**IV. APPLICATION OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO HALL\'S CONDUCT**

We first ask whether the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to
show that Hall\'s conduct created a substantial and unjustifiable risk
of death. Like other activities that generally do not involve a
substantial risk of death, such as driving a car or installing a heater,
"skiing too fast for the conditions" is not widely considered behavior
that constitutes a high degree of risk. However, we hold that the
specific facts in this case support a reasonable inference that Hall
created a substantial and unjustifiable risk that he would cause
another\'s death.

Several witnesses stated that Hall was skiing very fast. Allen and the
other eyewitnesses all said that Hall was travelling too fast for the
conditions, at an excessive rate of speed, and that he was out of
control. Allen said that Hall passed him on the slope travelling three
times faster than Allen, himself an expert skier. Sandberg presented
testimony that Hall was a ski racer, indicating that Hall was trained to
attain and ski at much faster speeds than even skilled and experienced
recreational skiers. The witnesses said that Hall was travelling
straight down the slope at such high speeds that, because of his lack of
control, he would not have been able to stop or avoid another person.

In addition to statements of witnesses, the nature of Cobb\'s injuries
and other facts of the collision support the inference that Hall was
skiing at an inordinately high speed when he struck Cobb. As Dr.
Galloway testified, the severe injuries Cobb sustained were consistent
with a person being thrown from a moving automobile during a crash. The
coroner said that although he could not estimate Hall\'s speed from
Cobb\'s injuries, Hall must have been travelling with "a significant
amount of speed" to generate sufficient force to cause a basal skull
fracture and brain injuries like Cobb\'s. Additionally, Hall crashed
through Lemaner\'s skis and poles after he struck Cobb---breaking one of
the poles in half---indicating a very high speed and great deal of
force. Hall came to rest over eighty feet past Cobb\'s body, further
suggesting that Hall was skiing at exceptionally high speeds. Thus,
based on the testimony of the witnesses and the coroner\'s examination
of Cobb\'s body, a reasonable person could conclude that Hall was skiing
at very high speeds, thereby creating a risk of serious injury or death
in the event of a skier-to-skier collision.

In addition to Hall\'s excessive speed, Hall was out of control and
unable to avoid a collision with another person. All the witnesses said
Hall was not traversing the slope and that he was skiing straight down
the fall line. Hall was back on his skis, with his ski tips in the air
and his arms out to his sides to maintain balance. Allen said that Hall
was bounced around by the moguls on the slope rather than skiing in
control and managing the bumps. Hall admitted to Deputy Mossness that he
first saw Cobb when he was airborne and that he was unable to stop when
he saw people below him just before the collision. Hence, in addition to
finding that Hall was skiing at a very high rate of speed, a reasonably
prudent person could have concluded that Hall was unable to anticipate
or avoid a potential collision with a skier on the trail below him.

While skiing ordinarily carries a very low risk of death to other
skiers, a reasonable person could have concluded that Hall\'s excessive
speed, lack of control, and improper technique for skiing bumps
significantly increased both the likelihood that a collision would occur
and the extent of the injuries that might result from such a collision,
including the possibility of death, in the event that a person like Cobb
unwittingly crossed Hall\'s downhill path. McWilliam testified that he
was aware of only two other deaths from skier collisions on Vail
mountain in the past eleven years, but a reasonable person could have
determined that Hall\'s conduct was precisely the type of skiing that
risked this rare result.

We next ask whether a reasonable person could have concluded that
Hall\'s creation of a substantial risk of death was unjustified. To the
extent that Hall\'s extremely fast and unsafe skiing created a risk of
death, Hall was serving no direct interest other than his own enjoyment.
Although the sport often involves high speeds and even moments where a
skier is temporarily out of control, a reasonable person could determine
that the enjoyment of skiing does not justify skiing at the speeds and
with the lack of control Hall exhibited. Thus, a reasonable person could
have found that Hall\'s creation of a substantial risk was
unjustifiable.

In addition to our conclusion that a reasonable person could have
entertained the belief that Hall\'s conduct created a substantial and
unjustifiable risk, we must ask whether Hall\'s conduct constituted a
"gross deviation" from the standard of care that a reasonable
law-abiding person (in this case, a reasonable, law-abiding, trained ski
racer and resort employee) would have observed in the circumstances.

As we noted, the nature of the sport involves moments of high speeds and
temporary losses of control. However, the General Assembly imposed upon
a skier the duty to avoid collisions with any person or object below
him. Although this statute may not form the basis of criminal liability,
it establishes the minimum standard of care for uphill skiers and, for
the purposes of civil negligence suits, creates a rebuttable presumption
that the skier is at fault whenever he collides with skiers on the slope
below him. A violation of a skier\'s duty in an extreme fashion, such as
here, may be evidence of conduct that constitutes a "gross deviation"
from the standard of care imposed by statute for civil negligence. Hall
admitted to Deputy Mossness that as he flew off a knoll, he saw people
below him but was unable to stop; Hall was travelling so fast and with
so little control that he could not possibly have respected his
obligation to avoid skiers below him on the slope. Additionally, Hall
skied in this manner for some time over a considerable distance,
demonstrating that his high speeds and lack of control were not the type
of momentary lapse of control or inherent danger associated with skiing.
Based on the evidence, a reasonable person could conclude that Hall\'s
conduct was a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable, experienced ski racer would have exercised knowing that
other people were on the slope in front of him and that he could not see
the area below the knolls and bumps over which he was jumping.

Having determined that Hall\'s conduct created a substantial and
unjustified risk of death that is a gross deviation from the reasonable
standard of care under the circumstances, we next ask whether a
reasonably prudent person could have entertained the belief that Hall
consciously disregarded that risk. Hall is a trained ski racer who had
been coached about skiing in control and skiing safely. Further, he was
an employee of a ski area and had a great deal of skiing experience.
Hall\'s knowledge and training could give rise to the reasonable
inference that he was aware of the possibility that by skiing so fast
and out of control he might collide with and kill another skier unless
he regained control and slowed down.

In addition to inferring Hall\'s awareness of the risk from Hall\'s
training and experience, a reasonable person with expert training and
knowledge of skiing may have realized that skiing at very high speeds
without enough control to stop or avoid a collision could seriously
injure or kill another skier. A reasonable expert and experienced skier
also might understand that in view of his duties under section
33--44--109, he must maintain enough control to avoid collisions with
skiers below him on the slope. Thus, both Hall\'s subjective knowledge
and the awareness that a reasonable person with Hall\'s background would
have had support the inference that Hall consciously disregarded the
risk he created by acting despite his awareness of the risk.

Although the risk that he would cause the death of another was probably
slight, Hall\'s conduct created a risk of death. Hall\'s collision with
Cobb involved enough force to kill Cobb and to simulate the type of head
injury associated with victims in car accidents. Even though it is a
rare occurrence, the court heard testimony that two skiers in the past
eleven years died on Vail mountain alone from skier-to-skier collisions.
Based on the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing, a reasonable
person could conclude that Hall\'s conduct involved a risk of death.

Thus, interpreting the facts presented in the light most favorable to
the prosecution, we hold that a reasonably prudent and cautious person
could have entertained the belief that Hall consciously disregarded a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that by skiing exceptionally fast and
out of control he might collide with and kill another person on the
slope.

Obviously, this opinion does not address whether Hall is ultimately
guilty of any crime. Rather, we hold only that the People presented
sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that Hall committed
reckless manslaughter, and the court should have bound Hall\'s case over
for trial.

 

 

 

2.2.2.2.2

Example Based on Constable v. Shimmen

 

Example based on *Constable v. Shimmen*, 84 Cr App R 7 (QBD 1986).

Consider the facts of Shimmen's case, as set forth by the lower court:

The defendant and four friends were outside a shop one evening joking
and larking about. One of the friends pushed the defendant who started
flailing his arms and legs without making contact with that friend. He
was warned that he might one day hurt someone but assured the friend he
had everything under control and made as if to strike the plate glass
window with his foot. His foot made contact with the window and broke
it. The defendant was charged with criminal damage contrary to Section
(1) of the Criminal Damage Act of 1971. It was conceded before the
justices that he had had no intention of breaking the window but the
prosecutor argued that he had acted recklessly. The defendant contended
that he had satisfied himself that there was no risk, because of his
muscular control and skill in the martial arts, and was, in the
circumstances, not reckless.

Isn't it true that if Shimmen believed he had eliminated all risk he was
not reckless? Does that mean that a jury is obligated to believe his
claim? If you were the prosecutor in this case, how would you
cross-examine Shimmen regarding the sincerity of his belief that he had
eliminated all risk through his mastery of the martial arts?

State v. Hazelwood

 

### *State v. Hazelwood*

Alaska Supreme Court\
\
946 P.2d 875 (Alaska 1997)

 

RABINOWITZ, Justice.

Respondent\'s conviction stems from the [Exxon Valdez
incident.](https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/exxon-valdez-oil-spill)[^1]
On March 24, 1989, Captain Joseph Hazelwood ran his ship aground off
Bligh Reef and reported he was \"evidently leaking some oil.\"
Eventually, eleven million gallons poured into Prince William Sound. A
jury subsequently convicted Hazelwood of negligent discharge of oil.

\[On appeal Hazelwood argued that the jury should have been instructed
that they could only find him guilty if his conduct involved criminal,
rather than ordinary civil, negligence \-- Ed.\]

The difference between criminal and civil negligence although not major
is distinct. Under both standards, a person acts \"negligently\" when he
fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a particular
result will occur.

The two tests part ways in their descriptions of the relevant unobserved
risk. Under ordinary negligence, \"the risk must be of such a nature and
degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a deviation from the
standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the
situation.\". Criminal negligence requires a greater risk. This standard
is met only when the risk is of such a nature and degree that the
failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard
of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.
Criminal negligence is something more than the slight degree of
negligence necessary to support a civil action for damages and is
negligence of a degree so gross as to be deserving of punishment.

In essence, then, the criminal negligence standard requires the jury to
find negligence so gross as to merit not just damages but also
punishment. It does not spill over into recklessness; there is still no
requirement that the defendant actually be aware of the risk of harm.
However, criminal negligence does require a more culpable mental state
than simple, ordinary negligence.

The statute under which Hazelwood was convicted provides in relevant
part:

A person may not discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the
discharge of petroleum \... into, or upon the waters or land of the
state except in quantities, and at times and locations or under
circumstances and conditions as the department may by regulation
permit\....

Former AS 46.03.790(a) (current AS 46.03.740). At the time of the
alleged crime, a person who \"negligently\" violated this provision was
guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

The Court of Appeals concluded that the unadorned use of the word
\"negligently\" created an ambiguity as to whether the statute rests on
criminal or ordinary negligence. Relying on its past decisions, the
court held that criminal liability may be imposed on the basis of simple
or ordinary negligence \"only for offenses dealing with heavily
regulated activities for which permits or licenses are required.\"

An appropriate place to begin an explanation for objective fault crimes
is with the objections of those who would abolish them altogether. In
Jerome Hall, *Negligent Behavior Should Be Excluded from Penal
Liability*, 63 Colo. L.Rev. 632 (1963), Professor Hall challenges the
alleged utility of sanctions based on negligence and strict liability.
He contends crimes that are not based on subjective awareness of
wrongdoing are, by their terms, not addressed to \"the extremely
important degree of individual freedom, autonomy, and awareness \...
expressed in (voluntary) action by a normal adult.\" Merely negligent
harm doers, contends Professor Hall, \"have not in the least thought of
their duty, their dangerous behavior, or any sanction.\"

The difficulty with this thesis is that it assumes legal regulations can
operate only through the offender\'s conscious reason. A rebuttal is
supplied by Professor Hart:

\[T\]he connexion between the threat of punishment and subsequent good
behavior is not \[always\] of the rationalistic kind pictured in the
guiding-type of case. The threat of punishment is something which causes
\[the offender\] to exert his faculties, rather than something which
enters as a reason for conforming to the law when he is deliberating
whether to break it or not. It is perhaps more like a goad than a guide.
But there seems to me to be nothing disreputable in allowing the law to
function in this way, and it is arguable that it functions in this way
rather than in the rationalistic way more frequently than is generally
allowed.

H.L.A. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility 134 (1968).

The law\'s \"goad,\" rather than its guide, is also emphasized by
Professor LaFave. He asks whether more than civil negligence should be
required for a criminal offense, and concludes \"that there is no need
to choose one answer for all crimes.\" His primary focus is on
deterrence:

The principal policy question is whether the threat of punishment for
objective fault will deter people from conducting themselves in such a
way as to create risk to others. Though the matter is disputed, it would
seem that some people can be made to think, before they act, about the
possible consequences of acting, so that the existence of
objective-fault crimes does tend to reduce risky conduct\... The point
is that the legislature might, in the exercise of its police power,
require subjective fault for some crimes and objective fault for other
crimes.

1 LaFave at 337-38 (footnotes omitted).

It is here, grounded in a theory of reasonable deterrence, that any
explanation for objective fault crimes must have its origins. Despite
Professor Hall\'s challenge, it cannot be disputed that the threat of
punishment necessarily deters. Even when an offender does not of his own
accord realize that his conduct is wrongful, he can in many cases be
made to take care. Coercion that causes the offender to pay attention
can serve important social aims that would not be achieved by
proscriptions that only come into effect when the transgressor
recognizes the harm in his or her behavior.

The fulcrum for deciding what level of intent is the absolute minimum
for a particular offense is a question of when an expectation of
individual conformity is reasonable. Due process under Alaska\'s
Constitution requires that social interests be weighed against those of
the individual. While society\'s interest in obtaining compliance with
its regulations is strong, it can never outweigh the individual\'s
interest in freedom from substantial punishment for a violation he or
she could not reasonably have been expected to avoid. The threshold
question, then, is whether the defendant\'s conduct is something which
society could reasonably expect to deter.

The principle of reasonable deterrence allows the imposition of strict
liability in some circumstances. Generally, a separate mental element
need not be proved when the failure to abide by a rule is inherently
unreasonable. This occurs, for instance, where a person\'s conduct is
hedged in by regulation, such that one may readily assume his or her
routine decisions are guided by rules. Thus, strict liability is
permitted for heavily regulated industries. Persons operating in
rule-laden environments, and whose actions have a substantial impact on
public health, safety, or welfare, can reasonably be assumed aware of
their governing codes.

Outside of these strict liability exceptions, though, a separate showing
of simple civil negligence is both necessary and sufficient under
Alaska\'s Constitution. Negligence, rather than gross negligence, is the
minimum, not because we believe it is the necessary element of every
prosecutor\'s case; indeed, all courts have allowed a separate showing
of mental culpability to be dispensed with altogether in some
circumstances. Rather, the negligence standard is constitutionally
permissible because it approximates what the due process guarantee aims
at: an assurance that criminal penalties will be imposed only when the
conduct at issue is something society can reasonably expect to deter.

This desire to differentiate criminal proceedings from civil proceedings
appears to drive the definition of criminal negligence. That standard is
typically characterized as \"something more\" than ordinary negligence.
Thus the only consensus and precision available in the definition of
criminal negligence is that it is not civil negligence.

This fear of tort standards is unfounded. In response to similar
allegations that civil standards do not protect, the Michigan Supreme
Court has noted that \"\[i\]t is just as much a violation of the due
process clause of the Constitution to take property as it is to take the
liberty of a person.\" In other words, the same constitutional clause
which governs the criminal prosecution would also govern a civil
proceeding, and it is undisputed that due process is satisfied by the
negligence standard in that forum.

We are not persuaded that the simple or ordinary civil negligence
standard is inadequate to protect Hazelwood\'s interests. We conclude
that the Superior Court\'s adoption of an ordinary civil negligence mens
rea standard in its instructions to the jury did not constitute a denial
of due process under article I, section 7 of the Alaska Constitution.

COMPTON, Chief Justice, dissenting.

. . . 

It is well established that \"\[m\]ere negligence is insufficient to
justify an award of punitive damages.\" *Johnson & Higgins of Alaska
Inc. v. Blomfield*, 907 P.2d 1371, 1376 (Alaska 1995) (holding that
punitive damages may only be awarded \"where the wrongdoer\'s conduct
can be characterized as outrageous, such as acts done with malice or bad
motives or a reckless indifference to the interests of others.\"). It is
difficult to accept the proposition that an action which cannot form the
basis for a punitive civil award fairly can be sanctioned with
imprisonment. Admittedly, the prohibition of punitive damages for
conduct which is merely negligent has not been constitutionalized.
However, this prohibition provides yet another strong indication that
judicially accepted notions of fairness foreclose the imposition of
explicitly punitive measures for conduct which is negligent under a
civil standard.

Since I cannot accept the proposition that imprisonment is a
fundamentally fair punishment for civil negligence, I cannot support the
court\'s decision to remove all due process barriers to the
criminalization of negligent conduct. Issues of substantive due process
are issues of public policy at their most basic level. I cannot agree
that public policy is served by giving legislators free rein to impose
criminal sanctions upon whatever conduct a jury may find to be
unreasonable.

 

 

 

 

2.2.3

Strict Liability

 

Thus far, we have seen courts struggle with how to explain to juries
what mens rea is required by a particular statute and how to instruct a
jury as to the meaning of that mens rea term. In this section, we turn
to those rare instances where the law imposes criminal sanction even in
the absence of a culpable mental state. These so-called strict liability
offenses are controversial; courts are reluctant to determine that the
legislature intended to impose liability without fault and the MPC has
rejected strict liability all together.

United States v. Balint

 

### *United States v. Balint*

United States Supreme Court

258 U.S. 250 (1922)

 

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the court.

Defendants in error were indicted for a violation of the Narcotic Act of
December 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785. The indictment charged them with
unlawfully selling to another a certain amount of a derivative of opium
and a certain amount of a derivative of coca leaves, not in pursuance of
any written order on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, contrary to the provisions of § 2 of
the act. The defendants demurrer to the indictment on the ground that it
failed to charge that they had sold the inhibited drugs knowing them to
be such. The statute does not make such knowledge an element of the
offense. The District Court sustained the demurrer and quashed the
indictment. The correctness of this ruling is the question before us.

While the general rule at common law was that the *scienter* was a
necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this
was followed in regard to statutory crimes even where the statutory
definition did not in terms include it, there has been a modification of
this view in respect to prosecutions under statutes the purpose of which
would be obstructed by such a requirement. It is a question of
legislative intent to be construed by the court. It has been objected
that punishment of a person for an act in violation of law when ignorant
of the facts making it so, is an absence of due process of law. But that
objection is considered and overruled in *Shevlin-Carpenter Co.* v.
*Minnesota,* 218 U.S. 57, 69, 70 \[1910\], in which it was held that in
the prohibition or punishment of particular acts, the State may in the
maintenance of a public policy provide \"that he who shall do them shall
do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good
faith or ignorance.\" Many instances of this are to be found in
regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power
where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some
social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases
of *mala in se*. So, too, in the collection of taxes, the importance to
the public of their collection leads the legislature to impose on the
taxpayer the burden of finding out the facts upon which his liability to
pay depends and meeting it at the peril of punishment. Again where one
deals with others and his mere negligence may be dangerous to them, as
in selling diseased food or poison, the policy of the law may, in order
to stimulate proper care, require the punishment of the negligent person
though he be ignorant of the noxious character of what he sells.

The question before us, therefore, is one of the construction of the
statute and of inference of the intent of Congress. The Narcotic Act has
been held by this court to be a taxing act with the incidental purpose
of minimizing the spread of addiction to the use of poisonous and
demoralizing drugs.

Section 2 of the Narcotic Act, 38 Stat. 786, we give in part in the
margin.^\[1\]^ It is very evident from a reading of  it that the
emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the
business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of
the Government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure
recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing
and restraining the traffic. Its manifest purpose is to require every
person dealing in drugs to ascertain at his peril whether that which he
sells comes within the inhibition of the statute, and if he sells the
inhibited drug in ignorance of its character, to penalize him. Congress
weighed the possible injustice of subjecting an innocent seller to a
penalty against the evil of exposing innocent purchasers to danger from
the drug, and concluded that the latter was the result preferably to be
avoided. Doubtless considerations as to the opportunity of the seller to
find out the fact and the difficulty of proof of knowledge contributed
to this conclusion. We think the demurrer to the indictment should have
been overruled.

*Judgment reversed.*

\[1\]

Sec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter,
exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of
a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered,

the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Every person who shall accept any
such order, and in pursuance thereof shall sell, barter, exchange, or
give away any of the aforesaid drugs, shall preserve such order for a
period of two years in such a way as to be readily accessible to
inspection by any officer, agent, or employee of the Treasury Department
duly authorized for that purpose, and the State, Territorial, District,
municipal, and insular officials named in section five of this Act.
Every person who shall give an order as herein provided to any other
person for any of the aforesaid drugs shall, at or before the time of
giving such order, make or cause to be made a duplicate thereof on a
form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, and in case of the acceptance of such order, shall
preserve such duplicate for said period of two years in such a way as to
be readily accessible to inspection by the officers, agents, employees,

2.2.3.2

Morissette v. United States

 

### *Morissette v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

342 U.S. 246 (1952)

 

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

On a large tract of uninhabited and untilled land in a wooded and
sparsely populated area of Michigan, the Government established a
practice bombing range over which the Air Force dropped simulated bombs
at ground targets. These bombs consisted of a metal cylinder about forty
inches long and eight inches across, filled with sand and enough black
powder to cause a smoke puff by which the strike could be located. At
various places about the range signs read \"Danger---Keep Out--- Bombing
Range.\" Nevertheless, the range was known as good deer country and was
extensively hunted.

Spent bomb casings were cleared from the targets and thrown into piles
\"so that they will be out of the way.\" They were not stacked or piled
in any order but were dumped in heaps, some of which had been
accumulating for four years or upwards, were exposed to the weather and
rusting away.

Morissette, in December of 1948, went hunting in this area but did not
get a deer. He thought to meet expenses of the trip by salvaging some of
these casings. He loaded three tons of them on his truck and took them
to a nearby farm, where they were flattened by driving a tractor over
them. After expending this labor and trucking them to market in Flint,
he realized \$84.

Morissette, by occupation, is a fruit stand operator in summer and a
trucker and scrap iron collector in winter. An honorably discharged
veteran of World War II, he enjoys a good name among his neighbors and
has had no blemish on his record more disreputable than a conviction for
reckless driving.

The loading, crushing and transporting of these casings were all in
broad daylight, in full view of passers-by, without the slightest effort
at concealment. When an investigation was started, Morissette
voluntarily, promptly and candidly told the whole story to the
authorities, saying that he had no intention of stealing but thought the
property was abandoned, unwanted and considered of no value to the
Government. He was indicted, however, on the charge that he \"did
unlawfully, wilfully and knowingly steal and convert\" property of the
United States of the value of \$84, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 641,
which provides that \"whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly
converts\" government property is punishable by fine and imprisonment.
Morissette was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two months or
to pay a fine of \$200. The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge
dissenting.

The court ruled that this particular offense requires no element of
criminal intent. This conclusion was thought to be required by the
failure of Congress to express such a requisite and this Court\'s
decisions in *United States v. Behrman*, 258 U. S. 280, and *United
States v. Balint*, 258 U. S. 250.

Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from
concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand, was
congenial to an intense individualism and took deep and early root in
American soil. As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if
their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that
the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle but merely
recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that
it required no statutory affirmation. Courts, with little hesitation or
division, found an implication of the requirement as to offenses that
were taken over from the common law. The unanimity with which they have
adhered to the central thought that wrongdoing must be conscious to be
criminal is emphasized by the variety, disparity and confusion of their
definitions of the requisite but elusive mental element. However, courts
of various jurisdictions, and for the purposes of different offenses,
have devised working formulae, if not scientific ones, for the
instruction of juries around such terms as \"felonious intent,\"
\"criminal intent,\" \"malice aforethought,\" \"guilty knowledge,\"
\"fraudulent intent,\" \"wilfulness,\" \"scienter,\" to denote guilty
knowledge, or \"mens rea,\" to signify an evil purpose or mental
culpability. By use or combination of these various tokens, they have
sought to protect those who were not blameworthy in mind from conviction
of infamous common-law crimes.

However, the *Balint* and *Behrman* offenses belong to a category of
another character, with very different antecedents and origins. The
crimes there involved depend on no mental element but consist only of
forbidden acts or omissions. This, while not expressed by the Court, is
made clear from examination of a century-old but accelerating tendency,
discernible both here and in England, to call into existence new duties
and crimes which disregard any ingredient of intent. The industrial
revolution multiplied the number of workmen exposed to injury from
increasingly powerful and complex mechanisms, driven by freshly
discovered sources of energy, requiring higher precautions by employers.
Traffic of velocities, volumes and varieties unheard of came to subject
the wayfarer to intolerable casualty risks if owners and drivers were
not to observe new cares and uniformities of conduct. Congestion of
cities and crowding of quarters called for health and welfare
regulations undreamed of in simpler times. Wide distribution of goods
became an instrument of wide distribution of harm when those who
dispersed food, drink, drugs, and even securities, did not comply with
reasonable standards of quality, integrity, disclosure and care. Such
dangers have engendered increasingly numerous and detailed regulations
which heighten the duties of those in control of particular industries,
trades, properties or activities that affect public health, safety or
welfare.

While many of these duties are sanctioned by a more strict civil
liability, lawmakers, whether wisely or not, have sought to make such
regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to be applied
by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and convictions. This
has confronted the courts with a multitude of prosecutions, based on
statutes or administrative regulations, for what have been aptly called
\"public welfare offenses.\" These cases do not fit neatly into any of
such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those
against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these
offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions,
with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of
neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a
duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or
immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or
probability of it which the law seeks to minimize. While such offenses
do not threaten the security of the state in the manner of treason, they
may be regarded as offenses against its authority, for their occurrence
impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social order
as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the intent of the
violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or
not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such
offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary
element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a
position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably
expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who
assumed his responsibilities. Also, penalties commonly are relatively
small, and conviction does no grave damage to an offender\'s reputation.
Under such considerations, courts have turned to construing statutes and
regulations which make no mention of intent as dispensing with it and
holding that the guilty act alone makes out the crime. This has not,
however, been without expressions of misgiving.

After the turn of the Century, a new use for crimes without intent
appeared when New York enacted numerous and novel regulations of
tenement houses, sanctioned by money penalties. Landlords contended that
a guilty intent was essential to establish a violation. Judge Cardozo
wrote the answer:

\"The defendant asks us to test the meaning of this statute by standards
applicable to statutes that govern infamous crimes. The analogy,
however, is deceptive. The element of conscious wrongdoing, the guilty
mind accompanying the guilty act, is associated with the concept of
crimes that are punished as infamous. . . . Even there it is not an
invariable element. . . . But in the prosecution of minor offenses,
there is a wider range of practice and of power. Prosecutions for petty
penalties have always constituted in our law a class by themselves. . .
. That is true though the prosecution is criminal in form.\" *Tenement
House Department v. McDevitt*, 215 N. Y. 160, 168 (1915).

Soon, employers advanced the same contention as to violations of
regulations prescribed by a new labor law. Judge Cardozo, again for the
court, pointed out, as a basis for penalizing violations whether
intentional or not, that they were punishable only by fine \"moderate in
amount,\" but cautiously added that in sustaining the power so to fine
unintended violations \"we are not to be understood as sustaining to a
like length the power to imprison. We leave that question open.\"
*People ex rel. Price v. Sheffield Farms Co.*, 225 N. Y. 25, 32-33
(1918).

Before long, similar questions growing out of federal legislation
reached this Court. Its judgments were in harmony with this consensus of
state judicial opinion, the existence of which may have led the Court to
overlook the need for full exposition of their rationale in the context
of federal law. In overruling a contention that there can be no
conviction on an indictment which makes no charge of criminal intent but
alleges only making of a sale of a narcotic forbidden by law, Chief
Justice Taft, wrote:

\"While the general rule at common law was that the scienter was a
necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this
was followed in regard to statutory crimes even where the statutory
definition did not in terms include it . . . , there has been a
modification of this view in respect to prosecutions under statutes the
purpose of which would be obstructed by such a requirement. It is a
question of legislative intent to be construed by the court. . . .\"
*United States v. Balint*, supra, 251-252.

He referred, however, to \"regulatory measures in the exercise of what
is called the police power where the emphasis  of the statute is
evidently upon achievement of some social betterment rather than the
punishment of the crimes as in cases of mala in se,\" and drew his
citation of supporting authority chiefly from state court cases dealing
with regulatory offenses.

On the same day, the Court determined that an offense under the Narcotic
Drug Act does not require intent, saying, \"If the offense be a
statutory one, and intent or knowledge is not made an element of it, the
indictment need not charge such knowledge or intent.\" *United States v.
Behrman*, supra, at 288.

Of course, the purpose of every statute would be \"obstructed\" by
requiring a finding of intent, if we assume that it had a purpose to
convict without it. Therefore, the obstruction rationale does not help
us to learn the purpose of the omission by Congress. And since no
federal crime can exist except by force of statute, the reasoning of the
Behrman opinion, if read literally, would work far-reaching changes in
the composition of all federal crimes. Had such a result been
contemplated, it could hardly have escaped mention by a Court which
numbered among its members one especially interested and informed
concerning the importance of intent in common-law crimes. This might be
the more expected since the Behrman holding did call forth his dissent,
in which Mr. Justice McReynolds and Mr. Justice Brandeis joined,
omitting any such mention.

It was not until recently that the Court took occasion more explicitly
to relate abandonment of the ingredient of intent, not merely with
considerations of expediency in obtaining convictions, nor with the
malum prohibitum classification of the crime, but with the peculiar
nature and quality of the offense. We referred to \". . . a now familiar
type of legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means of
regulation,\" and continued, \"such legislation dispenses with the
conventional requirement for criminal conduct---awareness of some
wrongdoing. In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of
acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in
responsible relation to a public danger.\" But we warned: \"Hardship
there doubtless may be under a statute which thus penalizes the
transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting.\"
*United States v. Dotterweich*, 320 U. S. 277, 280-281, 284.

Neither this Court nor, so far as we are aware, any other has undertaken
to delineate a precise line or set forth comprehensive criteria for
distinguishing between crimes that require a mental element and crimes
that do not. We attempt no closed definition, for the law on the subject
is neither settled nor static. The conclusion reached in the Balint and
Behrman cases has our approval and adherence for the circumstances to
which it was there applied. A quite different question here is whether
we will expand the doctrine of crimes without intent to include those
charged here.

Stealing, larceny, and its variants and equivalents, were among the
earliest offenses known to the law that existed before legislation; they
are invasions of rights of property which stir a sense of insecurity in
the whole community and arouse public demand for retribution, the
penalty is high and, when a sufficient amount is involved, the infamy is
that of a felony, which, says Maitland, is \". . . as bad a word as you
can give to man or thing.\" State courts of last resort, on whom fall
the heaviest burden of interpreting criminal law in this country, have
consistently retained the requirement of intent in larceny-type
offenses. If any state has deviated, the exception has neither been
called to our attention nor disclosed by our research.

Congress, therefore, omitted any express prescription of criminal intent
from the enactment before us in the light of an unbroken course of
judicial decision in all constituent states of the Union holding intent
inherent in this class of offense, even when not expressed in a statute.
Congressional silence as to mental elements in an Act merely adopting
into federal statutory law a concept of crime already so well defined in
common law and statutory interpretation by the states may warrant quite
contrary inferences than the same silence in creating an offense new to
general law, for whose definition the courts have no guidance except the
Act. Because the offenses before this Court in the Balint and Behrman
cases were of this latter class, we cannot accept them as authority for
eliminating intent from offenses incorporated from the common law. Nor
do exhaustive studies of state court cases disclose any well-considered
decisions applying the doctrine of crime without intent to such enacted
common-law offenses, although a few deviations are notable as
illustrative of the danger inherent in the Government\'s contentions
here.

We hold that mere omission from § 641 of any mention of intent will not
be construed as eliminating that element from the crimes denounced.

### *Staples v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

511 U.S. 600 (1994)

 

Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The National Firearms Act (Act), 26 U.S.C. §§ 5801--5872, imposes strict
registration requirements on statutorily defined "firearms." The Act
includes within the term "firearm" a machinegun, § 5845(a)(6), and
further defines a machinegun as "any weapon which shoots, \... or can be
readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without
manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger," § 5845(b). Thus,
any fully automatic weapon is a "firearm" within the meaning of the Act.
Under the Act, all firearms must be registered in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record maintained by the Secretary of the
Treasury. Section 5861(d) makes it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years
in prison for any person to possess a firearm that is not properly
registered.

Upon executing a search warrant at petitioner\'s home, local police and
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) recovered,
among other things, an AR--15 rifle. The AR--15 is the civilian version
of the military\'s M--16 rifle, and is, unless modified, a semiautomatic
weapon. The M--16, in contrast, is a selective fire rifle that allows
the operator, by rotating a selector switch, to choose semiautomatic or
automatic fire. Many M--16 parts are interchangeable with those in the
AR--15 and can be used to convert the AR--15 into an automatic weapon.
No doubt to inhibit such conversions, the AR--15 is manufactured with a
metal stop on its receiver that will prevent an M--16 selector switch,
if installed, from rotating to the fully automatic position. The metal
stop on petitioner\'s rifle, however, had been filed away, and the rifle
had been assembled with an M--16 selector switch and several other M--16
internal parts, including a hammer, disconnector, and trigger.
Suspecting that the AR--15 had been modified to be capable of fully
automatic fire, BATF agents seized the weapon. Petitioner subsequently
was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered machinegun in
violation of § 5861(d).

At trial, BATF agents testified that when the AR--15 was tested, it
fired more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger. It was
undisputed that the weapon was not registered as required by § 5861(d).
Petitioner testified that the rifle had never fired automatically when
it was in his possession. He insisted that the AR--15 had operated only
semiautomatically, and even then imperfectly, often requiring manual
ejection of the spent casing and chambering of the next round. According
to petitioner, his alleged ignorance of any automatic firing capability
should have shielded him from criminal liability for his failure to
register the weapon. He requested the District Court to instruct the
jury that, to establish a violation of § 5861(d), the Government must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant "knew that the gun
would fire fully automatically."

The District Court rejected petitioner\'s proposed instruction and
instead charged the jury as follows:

"The Government need not prove the defendant knows he\'s dealing with a
weapon possessing every last characteristic \[which subjects it\] to the
regulation. It would be enough to prove he knows that he is dealing with
a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the likelihood of
regulation."

Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to five years\' probation and a
\$5,000 fine.

Whether or not § 5861(d) requires proof that a defendant knew of the
characteristics of his weapon that made it a "firearm" under the Act is
a question of statutory construction. As we observed in *Liparota v.
United States*, 471 U.S. 419 (1985), "\[t\]he definition of the elements
of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in
the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute."
Thus, we have long recognized that determining the mental state required
for the commission of a federal crime requires "construction of the
statute and \... inference of the intent of Congress."

The language of the statute, the starting place in our inquiry, provides
little explicit guidance in this case. Section 5861(d) is silent
concerning the mens rea required for a violation. It states simply that
"\[i\]t shall be unlawful for any person \... to receive or possess a
firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d). Nevertheless,
silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggest that
Congress intended to dispense with a conventional mens rea element,
which would require that the defendant know the facts that make his
conduct illegal. On the contrary, we must construe the statute in light
of the background rules of the common law.

There can be no doubt that this established concept has influenced our
interpretation of criminal statutes. Indeed, we have noted that the
common-law rule requiring mens rea has been "followed in regard to
statutory crimes even where the statutory definition did not in terms
include it." Relying on the strength of the traditional rule, we have
stated that offenses that require no mens rea generally are disfavored
and have suggested that some indication of congressional intent, express
or implied, is required to dispense with mens rea as an element of a
crime.

According to the Government, however, the nature and purpose of the Act
suggest that the presumption favoring mens rea does not apply to this
case. The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate
and restrict the circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in the
Government\'s view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning
what we have termed "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses, in which
we have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal
liability through statutes that do not require the defendant to know the
facts that make his conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we
have inferred from silence that Congress did not intend to require proof
of mens rea to establish an offense.

For example, in *Balint*, we concluded that the Narcotic Act of 1914,
which was intended in part to minimize the spread of addictive drugs by
criminalizing undocumented sales of certain narcotics, required proof
only that the defendant knew that he was selling drugs, not that he knew
the specific items he had sold were "narcotics" within the ambit of the
statute. *Cf. United States v. Dotterweich*, 320 U.S. 277, 281 (1943)
(stating in dicta that a statute criminalizing the shipment of
adulterated or misbranded drugs did not require knowledge that the items
were misbranded or adulterated). As we explained in *Dotterweich*,
*Balint* dealt with "a now familiar type of legislation whereby
penalties serve as effective means of regulation. Such legislation
dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal
conduct---awareness of some wrongdoing." 320 U.S., at 280--281.

Such public welfare offenses have been created by Congress, and
recognized by this Court, in "limited circumstances." Typically, our
cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that regulate
potentially harmful or injurious items. In such situations, we have
reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a
dangerous device of a character that places him "in responsible relation
to a public danger," he should be alerted to the probability of strict
regulation, and we have assumed that in such cases Congress intended to
place the burden on the defendant to "ascertain at his peril whether
\[his conduct\] comes within the inhibition of the statute." *Balint*,
supra, 258 U.S., at 254. Thus, we essentially have relied on the nature
of the statute and the particular character of the items regulated to
determine whether congressional silence concerning the mental element of
the offense should be interpreted as dispensing with conventional mens
rea requirements.

The Government argues that § 5861(d) defines precisely the sort of
regulatory offense described in *Balint*. In this view, all guns,
whether or not they are statutory "firearms," are dangerous devices that
put gun owners on notice that they must determine at their hazard
whether their weapons come within the scope of the Act. On this
understanding, the District Court\'s instruction in this case was
correct, because a conviction can rest simply on proof that a defendant
knew he possessed a "firearm" in the ordinary sense of the term.

The Government seeks support for its position from our decision in
*United States v. Freed*, 401 U.S. 601 (1971), which involved a
prosecution for possession of unregistered grenades under § 5861(d). The
defendant knew that the items in his possession were grenades, and we
concluded that § 5861(d) did not require the Government to prove the
defendant also knew that the grenades were unregistered. To be sure, in
deciding that mens rea was not required with respect to that element of
the offense, we suggested that the Act "is a regulatory measure in the
interest of the public safety, which may well be premised on the theory
that one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand
grenades is not an innocent act." Grenades, we explained, "are highly
dangerous offensive weapons, no less dangerous than the narcotics
involved in *United States v. Balint*." But that reasoning provides
little support for dispensing with mens rea in this case.

\[T\]he Government urges that *Freed\'s* logic applies because guns, no
less than grenades, are highly dangerous devices that should alert their
owners to the probability of regulation. But the gap between *Freed* and
this case is too wide to bridge. In glossing over the distinction
between grenades and guns, the Government ignores the particular care we
have taken to avoid construing a statute to dispense with mens rea where
doing so would "criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent
conduct." In *Liparota*, we considered a statute that made unlawful the
unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps. We determined
that the statute required proof that the defendant knew his possession
of food stamps was unauthorized, largely because dispensing with such a
mens rea requirement would have resulted in reading the statute to
outlaw a number of apparently innocent acts. Our conclusion that the
statute should not be treated as defining a public welfare offense
rested on the commonsense distinction that a "food stamp can hardly be
compared to a hand grenade."

Neither, in our view, can all guns be compared to hand grenades.
Although the contrast is certainly not as stark as that presented in
*Liparota*, the fact remains that there is a long tradition of
widespread lawful gun ownership by private individuals in this country.
Such a tradition did not apply to the possession of hand grenades in
*Freed* or to the selling of dangerous drugs that we considered in
*Balint*. In fact, in *Freed* we construed § 5861(d) under the
assumption that "one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession
of hand grenades is not an innocent act." Here, the Government
essentially suggests that we should interpret the section under the
altogether different assumption that "one would hardly be surprised to
learn that owning a gun is not an innocent act." That proposition is
simply not supported by common experience. Guns in general are not
"deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials," that put
their owners on notice that they stand "in responsible relation to a
public danger."

The Government protests that guns, unlike food stamps, but like grenades
and narcotics, are potentially harmful devices. Under this view, it
seems that *Liparota\'s* concern for criminalizing ostensibly innocuous
conduct is inapplicable whenever an item is sufficiently
dangerous---that is, dangerousness alone should alert an individual to
probable regulation and justify treating a statute that regulates the
dangerous device as dispensing with mens rea. But that an item is
"dangerous," in some general sense, does not necessarily suggest, as the
Government seems to assume, that it is not also entirely innocent. Even
dangerous items can, in some cases, be so commonplace and generally
available that we would not consider them to alert individuals to the
likelihood of strict regulation. As suggested above, despite their
potential for harm, guns generally can be owned in perfect innocence. Of
course, we might surely classify certain categories of guns---no doubt
including the machineguns, sawed-off shotguns, and artillery pieces that
Congress has subjected to regulation---as items the ownership of which
would have the same quasi-suspect character we attributed to owning hand
grenades in *Freed*. But precisely because guns falling outside those
categories traditionally have been widely accepted as lawful
possessions, their destructive potential, while perhaps even greater
than that of some items we would classify along with narcotics and hand
grenades, cannot be said to put gun owners sufficiently on notice of the
likelihood of regulation to justify interpreting § 5861(d) as not
requiring proof of knowledge of a weapon\'s characteristics.

On a slightly different tack, the Government suggests that guns are
subject to an array of regulations at the federal, state, and local
levels that put gun owners on notice that they must determine the
characteristics of their weapons and comply with all legal requirements.
But regulation in itself is not sufficient to place gun ownership in the
category of the sale of narcotics in *Balint*. The food stamps at issue
in *Liparota* were subject to comprehensive regulations, yet we did not
understand the statute there to dispense with a mens rea requirement.
Moreover, despite the overlay of legal restrictions on gun ownership, we
question whether regulations on guns are sufficiently intrusive that
they impinge upon the common experience that owning a gun is usually
licit and blameless conduct. Roughly 50 percent of American homes
contain at least one firearm of some sort, and in the vast majority of
States, buying a shotgun or rifle is a simple transaction that would not
alert a person to regulation any more than would buying a car.

If we were to accept as a general rule the Government\'s suggestion that
dangerous and regulated items place their owners under an obligation to
inquire at their peril into compliance with regulations, we would
undoubtedly reach some untoward results. Automobiles, for example, might
also be termed "dangerous" devices and are highly regulated at both the
state and federal levels. Congress might see fit to criminalize the
violation of certain regulations concerning automobiles, and thus might
make it a crime to operate a vehicle without a properly functioning
emission control system. But we probably would hesitate to conclude on
the basis of silence that Congress intended a prison term to apply to a
car owner whose vehicle\'s emissions levels, wholly unbeknownst to him,
began to exceed legal limits between regular inspection dates.

Here, there can be little doubt that, as in *Liparota*, the
Government\'s construction of the statute potentially would impose
criminal sanctions on a class of persons whose mental state---ignorance
of the characteristics of weapons in their possession---makes their
actions entirely innocent. The Government does not dispute the
contention that virtually any semiautomatic weapon may be converted,
either by internal modification or, in some cases, simply by wear and
tear, into a machinegun within the meaning of the Act. Such a gun may
give no externally visible indication that it is fully automatic. But in
the Government\'s view, any person who has purchased what he believes to
be a semiautomatic rifle or handgun, or who simply has inherited a gun
from a relative and left it untouched in an attic or basement, can be
subject to imprisonment, despite absolute ignorance of the gun\'s firing
capabilities, if the gun turns out to be an automatic.

We concur in the Fifth Circuit\'s conclusion on this point: "It is
unthinkable to us that Congress intended to subject such law-abiding,
well-intentioned citizens to a possible ten-year term of imprisonment if
\... what they genuinely and reasonably believed was a conventional
semi-automatic \[weapon\] turns out to have worn down into or been
secretly modified to be a fully automatic weapon." As we noted in
*Morissette*, the "purpose and obvious effect of doing away with the
requirement of a guilty intent is to ease the prosecution\'s path to
conviction." We are reluctant to impute that purpose to Congress where,
as here, it would mean easing the path to convicting persons whose
conduct would not even alert them to the probability of strict
regulation in the form of a statute such as § 5861(d).

The potentially harsh penalty attached to the violation of §
5861(d)---up to 10 years\' imprisonment---confirms our reading of the
Act. Historically, the penalty imposed under a statute has been a
significant consideration in determining whether the statute should be
construed as dispensing with mens rea. Certainly, the cases that first
defined the concept of the public welfare offense almost uniformly
involved statutes that provided for only light penalties such as fines
or short jail sentences, not imprisonment in the state penitentiary.

Close adherence to the early cases described above might suggest that
punishing a violation as a felony is simply incompatible with the theory
of the public welfare offense. In this view, absent a clear statement
from Congress that mens rea is not required, we should not apply the
public welfare offense rationale to interpret any statute defining a
felony offense as dispensing with mens rea.

We need not adopt such a definitive rule of construction to decide this
case, however. Instead, we note only that where, as here, dispensing
with mens rea would require the defendant to have knowledge only of
traditionally lawful conduct, a severe penalty is a further factor
tending to suggest that Congress did not intend to eliminate a mens rea
requirement. In such a case, the usual presumption that a defendant must
know the facts that make his conduct illegal should apply.

In short, we conclude that the background rule of the common law
favoring mens rea should govern interpretation of § 5861(d) in this
case. Silence does not suggest that Congress dispensed with mens rea for
the element of § 5861(d) at issue here. Thus, to obtain a conviction,
the Government should have been required to prove that petitioner knew
of the features of his AR--15 that brought it within the scope of the
Act.

Example Based on US v. X-Citement Video

 

Title 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (1988 ed. and Supp. V) provides, in relevant
part:

\(a\) Any person who---

\(1\) knowingly transports or ships in interstate or foreign commerce by
any means including by computer or mails, any visual depiction, if---

\(A\) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and

\(B\) such visual depiction is of such conduct;

\(2\) knowingly receives, or distributes, any visual depiction that has
been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign
commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so
shipped or transported, by any means including by computer, or knowingly
reproduces any visual depiction for distribution in interstate or
foreign commerce or through the mails, if---

\(A\) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and

\(B\) such visual depiction is of such conduct;

\....

shall be punished \[by up to 10 years in prison\].

Must the government prove that the defendant knew that the images he
sent through the mails were of minors engaging in sexual activity? Or is
it sufficient to show that she knew that she was shipping visual
depictions and that those depictions were in fact of minors engaged in
sexual activity?

*See*, *United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.*, 513 U.S. 64 (1994)
(concluding that, although "the most grammatical reading of the statute"
would apply strict liability on that point, public policy and
legislative history suggest that was not Congress's intent).

Fleming v. Texas

 

455 S.W.3d 577 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)

 

In *Fleming*, the defendant argued both that the legislature intended
for mistake of fact with regard to age to provide a defense *and* that
it would be unconsitutitonal for the state to punish him in the absence
of proof that he was aware of the age of the person with whom he was
having sex. In support of the latter argument, he cited the Supreme
Court\'s decision in *Lawrence v. Texas*, concluding that a state may
not constitutionally criminalize consensual sexual conduct between
adults. As you read this case, consider how *Lawrence* might be relevant
to the outcome of this case.

 

Fleming v. Texas\
455 S.W.3d 577 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

Appellant, Mark Alexander Fleming, was charged with four counts of
aggravated sexual assault under Texas Penal Code Section
22.021(a)(1)(B)(iii), (2)(B).

Appellant testified that in April of 2007 he received a text message
from a girl, K.M., who said that she had obtained his phone number from
her friend. When Appellant asked her age, she replied that she was 22
years old. K.M. was actually 13 years old. The two corresponded by text
message and talked on the phone for a week or two and then arranged to
meet at the mall for a date. Both Appellant and K.M. testified that on
their first date they went to a movie and drag races at a race track,
after which Appellant drove K.M. home. Appellant stated that K.M. told
him that her mother and step-father lived with her because they had lost
their home. After their second date to dinner and a movie, Appellant
asked K.M. if she wanted to spend the night with him at the hotel where
he had been staying. Appellant testified that K.M. said that she did
want to go to his hotel but that she was not ready for them to have
sexual relations at that time. Appellant said that he agreed and that
they went to sleep upon arrival at the hotel. Appellant testified that
when he awoke early the next morning, K.M. was "messing with" him in a
way that indicated that she wanted to have sex. He asked her if she was
sure, and she said that she was. Appellant and K.M. continued dating and
having sex from April to May of 2007. Later that year, K.M.'s mom found
a love letter that Appellant had written to K.M. Appellant, who was 25
years old at the time, wrote in the letter, "I no you 4 years or 5 years
younger then me but I love you." When her mom confronted her about the
letter, K.M. initially denied the relationship. When K.M. admitted that
she did have sex with Appellant, her mom called the police. Appellant
was cooperative during questioning by the police and told the officer
about the relationship. He told the officer that he did not know that
K.M. was under age when he dated her. At trial, Appellant testified that
he believed that K.M. was 22 years of age because both K.M. and her
friend had told him that she was 22 years old, and because K.M. had told
him that she was a student at the University of North Texas majoring in
criminal justice. He also testified that he had seen on her MySpace
page, which was entered into evidence by the defense, that she was 20
years old and was a student at UNT. The MySpace page entered into
evidence by the defense also contained photos of K.M. that were taken
around the time she was dating Appellant. K.M. denied having told
Appellant that she was 22 years old and testified that someone else must
have changed her MySpace page. She said she did not know if Appellant
knew that she was under age when they dated. The State presented
evidence that Appellant had previously dated a friend of K.M.'s mom, who
sometimes babysat K.M. when she was younger. The State said that K.M.
would have been 11 years old when Appellant first met her at her mom's
house. K.M. said that Appellant had been to her mother's house in the
past but she did not know if he remembered meeting her then.

Appellant agreed to a ten-year probated sentence and retained the right
to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to quash. He appealed,
arguing that Penal Code Section 22.021 is unconstitutional due to its
failure to require proof that he had knowledge that his victim was
younger than 17 years of age and for not recognizing an affirmative
defense based on the defendant's reasonable belief that the victim was
17 years of age or older.

CASE LAW

The mistake-of-age defense was raised and rejected in the 1876 English
case of Regina v. Prince, 13 Cox, Criminal Cases 138
(Eng.Crim.App.1876). In Prince, the defendant was charged with
unlawfully taking a girl under the age of 16 out of the possession of
her father against his will. The defendant claimed that he acted on the
reasonable belief that the girl was 18 years of age. The court held that
it was no defense that he thought he was committing a different kind of
wrong from that which he was, in fact, committing, it being wrong to
remove a daughter, even one over the age of 16, from her father's
household. Citing previous cases, the court stated that "any man who
dealt with an unmarried female did so at his own peril, and if she
turned out to be under sixteen years old he was liable under this
statute." Although the issue in Prince was mistake of age as to
abduction, early American courts applied Prince to statutory rape as
well. The reasoning from Prince has been used to justify denying the
mistake-of-age defense and imposing strict liability against those
accused of statutory rape.

In Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246 (1952), the Supreme Court
discussed strict liability offenses and noted that, while there must
usually be a "vicious will" to constitute a crime, there are exceptions
to this rule, including rape cases in which age is the determinative
factor, despite the defendant's reasonable belief that the victim was
over the age of consent. For strict liability crimes, there is no
"guilty mind" requirement, and the actor does not have to possess the
mens rea to commit any crime. In such strict-liability offenses, the
actor's state of mind is irrelevant, and he is guilty of the crime at
the moment he commits the prohibited act. Most strict liability statutes
are associated with the protection of public health, safety, or welfare,
such as those involving air and water pollution, sale of adulterated
food, and traffic and motor-vehicle laws. Statutory rape, however, is
distinguishable in that the act of sexual intercourse is not a crime
except in certain circumstances, such as when the other person has not
consented to the act or when the other person is deemed unable to
consent due to his or her age.

DISCUSSION

Mens rea as to the age of the victim

While it is indeed widely known that "16 will get you 20," and
precocious young girls have commonly been referred to as "jail bait,"
such colloquialisms address only the understanding that even consensual
sex with someone underage is a violation. These phrases indicate
knowledge of the sexual partner's young age as opposed to an
understanding that knowledge of the age is unnecessary. Texas Penal Code
does not specify that mens rea as to the age of the victim is
unnecessary, however, under federal law, "the Government need not prove
that the defendant knew that the other person engaging in the sexual act
had not attained the age of 12 years." See 18 U.S.C. § 2241(d).

It is clear that the Texas legislature intends for age to be an
aggravating element in certain offenses and does not intend for the
State to be required to prove that the defendant knew the age of the
victim. For example, the sexual assault statutes delineate the severity
of the offense based in part on the age of the victim. Specifically,
Penal Code Section 22.011(a)(2) covers sexual assault of a child under
the age of 17. However, when the victim is younger than 14 years of age,
the offense is aggravated sexual assault under Penal Code Section
22.021. Similarly, murder under Penal Code Section 19.02 may increase to
capital murder under Section 19.03 if the victim is under 10 years of
age. There is no mens rea as to age listed in either the sexual assault
or murder statutes and there is no fundamental right to a mens rea
element regarding the age of the victim in these contexts.

Because this statute serves the legitimate state objective of protecting
children, we will not read a mens rea element into the statute and do
not believe that failure to require mens rea as to the victim's age
violates the federal or state constitution. The statutory prohibition of
an adult having sex with a person who is under the age of consent serves
to protect young people from being coerced by the power of an older,
more mature person. The fact that the statute does not require the State
to prove mens rea as to the victim's age places the burden on the adult
to ascertain the age of a potential sexual partner and to avoid sexual
encounters with those who are determined to be too young to consent to
such encounters. If the adult chooses not to ascertain the age of a
sexual partner, then the adult assumes the risk that he or she may be
held liable for the conduct if it turns out that the sexual partner is
underage.

Mistake-of-fact defense

While both the sexual assault and the murder statutes specify a more
severe punishment based on the age of the victim, neither offense
contains a provision that allows for a mistake-of-fact defense as to the
age of the victim. Under Penal Code Section 8.02(a), "It is a defense to
prosecution that the actor through mistake formed a reasonable belief
about a matter of fact if his mistaken belief negated the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense." Because Section
22.021 requires no culpability as to the age of the victim, there is
nothing for the defendant's mistaken belief to negate, and his mistake
cannot be a defense to prosecution.

Appellant asks for an affirmative defense so that he may claim that even
though the allegations in the indictment are true, he should not be
convicted due to his assertion that he did not know that K.M. was 13
years of age. The legislature's intent of protecting children from
sexual assault is clear, and it outweighs any claim of the right to
present a mistake-of-age defense. When a defendant voluntarily engages
in sexual activity with someone who may be within a protected age group,
he should know that there may be criminal consequences and there will be
no excuse for such actions. When it comes to protecting those who are
unable, due to their tender age, to consent to sexual activity, the
legislature simply does not allow any variance.

It would be unconscionable for us to allow a 25--year--old man who was
having sex with a 13--year--old child to claim that his actions were
excused because he reasonably believed that he was having sex with an
adult. Such a defense is precluded by the overriding interest in
protecting children.

CONCLUSION

Texas Penal Code Section 22.021 is not unconstitutional under the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Due Course of Law
provision of the Texas Constitution for failing to require the State to
prove that the defendant had a culpable mental state regarding the
victim's age or for failure to recognize an affirmative defense based on
the defendant's belief that the victim was 17 years of age or older. 

4 We note that Penal Code Section 19.03(a)(1) requirest he State to
prove that the defendant knew that the victim was a peace officer or
fireman in order for the offense to increase from murder to capital
murder. This indicates to us that when the legislature wants to require
the State to prove that the offencer knew the status of the victim, such
a requirement is clearly stated in the statute.

### Comment to Section 2.04(1)

Subsection (1) states the conventional position under which the
significance of ignorance by the defendant of a matter of fact or law,
or a mistake as to such matters, is determined by the mental state
required for the commission of the offense involved. Thus, ignorance or
mistake is a defense when it negates the existence of a state of mind
that is essential to the commission of an offense, or when it
establishes a state of mind that constitutes a defense under the rule of
law relating to defenses.

To put the matter as this subsection does is not to say anything that
would not otherwise be true, even if no provision on the subject were
made. \[T\]he rule relating to mistake "is not a new rule; and the law
could be stated equally well without reference to mistake."

 

 

 

2.2.4.2

Mistake of Law

 

We have encountered mistake claims previously. We saw from cases like
*Fleming* that a mistake is a defense to a crime if it negates the mens
rea required by statute. As the Model Penal Code points out, whether we
use the language of mistake or not makes no difference: A mistake
provides a defense if and only if it negates the mens rea required by
statute.

Therefore these cases require us to determine what mens rea is required
by statute and then whether the defendant\'s claim of mistake
demonstrates that he did not have that mens rea.

### Note on Legal Elements

In People v. Marrero, 69 N.Y.2d 382 (1987), the defendant was a
correctional officer at a federal prison in Connecticut who was arrested
with a pistol in a NYC nightclub. He was charged with illegal possession
of that weapon under New York state law. He objected that as a federal
correctional officer, he was entitled to carry a concealed weapon under
a separate NY statute that exempted from the concealed carry prohibition
"correction officers of any state correction facility or of *any penal
correctional institution*." (emphasis added)

The trial court concluded that Marrero had misread the statute and also
refused to instruct the jury on mistake of law based on what it
concluded was Marrero's erroneous reading of the statute. The state high
court, ultimately, agreed. 

Marrero was mistaken about the meaning of peace officer as used in the
New York code. But this was not the provision he was charged with
violating (he was confused about who was a peace officer and he was
charged under a statute that prohibited the possession of a concealed
weapon). In concluding that his (quite reasonable) mistake did not
afford him a defense, the court necessarily (but not explicitly) must
have concluded that the statute required no mens rea with regard to
whether Marrero was a peace officer. Therefore his mistake, however
reasonable, could not provide him with a defense.

A number of cases are more explicit about the matter.

For example in *Regina v. David Smith*, 2 Q.B. 354 (1974) the defendant
was charged under a statute that punished: "A person who, without lawful
excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending
to destroy such property or being reckless as to whether any such
property would be destroyed or damaged." The defendant had damaged floor
panels and floor boards that he had installed in his rental unit in
order to remove the wires he had placed behind them when installing his
stereo system. Although the trial court informed the jury that the
defendant's (incorrect) belief that the flooring was his own was not
relevant, the appellate court reversed: "\[i\]n our judgment no offence
is committed under this section if a person destroys or causes damage to
property belong to another if he does so in the honest though mistaken
belief that he property is his own."

What mens rea did the *Smith* court read into the statute with regard to
ownership of the property?

Similarly in *State v. Woods*, 179 A. 1. (Vt. 1935) Ms. Woods was
charged under a statute that prohibited "A man with another man's wife,
or a man with another woman's husband, found in bed together, under
circumstances affording presumption of an illicit intention." Ms. Woods
had traveled with Shuffelt, the man with whom she was eventually found
in bed, to Reno, Nevada where he divorced his first wife and then
married Ms. Woods. Unfortunately for Ms. Woods, the divorce was
ineffective as neither Suffelt nor his wife was a Nevada resident. Thus,
Ms. Woods believed, reasonably, though wrongly, that the man she was
lying with was her husband rather than "another woman's husband." The
Court, finding that public policy against "attempted foreign divorces"
would be eviscerated by claims of ignorance, disagreed: "When it is
proved that the parties were found in bed together under circumstances
affording a presumption of an intention to commit the act charged in the
indictment or information, then the requirement of the statute is met
and ignorance of the law cannot be urged as a defense."

What mens rea did the *Woods* court read into the statute with regard to
whether one's bed companion is married to another?

### Section 2.02(9) *Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct.*

Neither knowledge nor recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct
constitutes an offense or as to the existence, meaning, or application
of the law defining the elements of an offense is an element of such
offense, unless the definition of the offense or the Code so provides.

 

 

 

2.2.4.2.1.3

Comment to MPC Section 2.02(9)

 

### Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct

Subsection (9) states the conventional position that knowledge of the
existence, meaning, or application of the law determining the elements
of an offense is not an element of that offense, except in the unusual
situations where the law defining the offense so provides.

It should be noted that the general principle that ignorance or mistake
of law is no excuse is greatly overstated; it has no application for
example when the circumstances made material by the definition of the
offense include a legal element. Thus it is immaterial in theft when
claim of right is adduced in defense, that the claim involves a legal
judgment as to the right of property. Claim of right is a defense
because the property must belong to someone else for the theft to occur
and the defendant must have culpable awareness of that fact. Insofar as
this point is involved, there is no need to state a special principle;
the legal element involved is simply an aspect of the attendant
circumstances, with respect to which knowledge, recklessness, or
negligence, as the case may be, is required for culpability by
Subsections (1) and (3). The law involved is not the law defining the
offense; it is some other legal rule that characterizes the attendant
circumstances that are material to the offense.

The proper arena for the principle that ignorance or mistake of law does
not afford an excuse is thus with respect to the particular law that
sets forth the definition of the crime in question. It is knowledge of
*that* law that is normally not a part of the crime, and it is ignorance
or mistake as to *that* law that is denied defensive significance by
this subsection of the Code and by the traditional common law approach
to the issue.

 

 

 

2.2.4.2.2

Knowing or Willful Violations

 

The cases in the section deal not with legal elements (\"taking the
property of another,\" \"below the age of consent,\" etc.) but with
those rare situations where the law will excuse a defendant who knows
exactly what she is doing but is unaware that the law prohibits her
conduct. As with most questions of mens rea, courts treat this idea of
\"willful\" or \"knowing\" violation as a matter of legislative intent.

Cheek v. United States

 

### *Cheek v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

498 U.S. 192 (1991)

 

Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Title 26 § 7201 of the United States Code provides that any person "who
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by
this title or the payment thereof" shall be guilty of a felony. Under 26
U. S. C. § 7203, "\[a\]ny person required under this title \... or by
regulations made under authority thereof to make a return . . . who
willfully fails to . . . make such return" shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. This case turns on the meaning of the word "willfully" as
used in §§7201 and 7203.

**I.**

Petitioner John L. Cheek has been a pilot for American Airlines since
1973. He filed federal income tax returns through 1979 but thereafter
ceased to file returns. He also claimed an increasing number of
withholding allowances --- eventually claiming 60 allowances by mid-1980
--- and for the years 1981 to 1984 indicated on his W-4 forms that he
was exempt from federal income taxes. In 1983, petitioner unsuccessfully
sought a refund of all tax withheld by his employer in 1982.
Petitioner's income during this period at all times far exceeded the
minimum necessary to trigger the statutory filing requirement.

As a result of his activities, petitioner was indicted for 10 violations
of federal law. He was charged with six counts of willfully failing to
file a federal income tax return for the years 1980, 1981, and 1983
through 1986, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7203. He was further charged
with three counts of willfully attempting to evade his income taxes for
the years 1980, 1981, and 1983 in violation of § 7201. In those years,
American Airlines withheld substantially less than the amount of tax
petitioner owed because of the numerous allowances and exempt status he
claimed on his W-4 forms. The tax offenses with which petitioner was
charged are specific intent crimes that require the defendant to have
acted willfully.

In the course of its instructions, the trial court advised the jury that
to prove "willfulness" the Government must prove the voluntary and
intentional violation of a known legal duty, a burden that could not be
proved by showing mistake, ignorance, or negligence. The court further
advised the jury that an objectively reasonable good-faith
misunderstanding of the law would negate willfulness, but mere
disagreement with the law would not. The court described Cheek's beliefs
about the income tax system and instructed the jury that if it found
that Cheek "honestly and reasonably believed that he was not required to
pay income taxes or to file tax returns" a not guilty verdict should be
returned.

After several hours of deliberation, the jury sent a note to the judge
that stated in part:

"We have a basic disagreement between some of us as to if Mr. Cheek
honestly & reasonably believed that he was not required to pay income
taxes.

Page 32 \[the relevant jury instruction\] discusses good faith
misunderstanding & disagreement. Is there any additional clarification
you can give us on this point?"

The District Judge responded with a supplemental instruction containing
the following statements:

"\[A\] person's opinion that the tax laws violate his constitutional
rights does not constitute a good faith misunderstanding of the law.
Furthermore, a person's disagreement with the government's tax
collection systems and policies does not constitute a good faith
misunderstanding of the law."

At the end of the first day of deliberation, the jury sent out another
note saying that it still could not reach a verdict because "\[w\]e are
divided on the issue as to if Mr. Cheek honestly & reasonably believed
that he was not required to pay income tax." When the jury resumed its
deliberations, the District Judge gave the jury an additional
instruction. This instruction stated in part that "\[a\]n honest but
unreasonable belief is not a defense and does not negate willfulness"
and that "\[a\]dvice or research resulting in the conclusion that wages
of a privately employed person are not income or that the tax laws are
unconstitutional is not objectively reasonable and cannot serve as the
basis for a good faith misunderstanding of the law defense." The court
also instructed the jury that "\[p\]ersistent refusal to acknowledge the
law does not constitute a good faith misunderstanding of the law."
Approximately two hours later, the jury returned a verdict finding
petitioner guilty on all counts.

**II.**

The general rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no
defense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American legal
system. Based on the notion that the law is definite and knowable, the
common law presumed that every person knew the law. This common-law rule
has been applied by the Court in numerous cases construing criminal
statutes.

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it
difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of
the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. Congress has
accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making
specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal
criminal tax offenses. Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted
the statutory term "willfully" as used in the federal criminal tax
statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule. This
special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the
complexity of the tax laws.

### III.

Willfulness, as construed by our prior decisions in criminal tax cases,
requires the Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the
defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily
and intentionally violated that duty. We deal first with the case where
the issue is whether the defendant knew of the duty purportedly imposed
by the provision of the statute or regulation he is accused of
violating, a case in which there is no claim that the provision at issue
is invalid. In such a case, if the Government proves actual knowledge of
the pertinent legal duty, the prosecution, without more, has satisfied
the knowledge component of the willfulness requirement. But carrying
this burden requires negating a defendant's claim of ignorance of the
law or a claim that because of a misunderstanding of the law, he had a
good-faith belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the
tax laws. This is so because one cannot be aware that the law imposes a
duty upon him and yet be ignorant of it, misunderstand the law, or
believe that the duty does not exist. In the end, the issue is whether,
based on all the evidence, the Government has proved that the defendant
was aware of the duty at issue, which cannot be true if the jury credits
a good-faith misunderstanding and belief submission, whether or not the
claimed belief or misunderstanding is objectively reasonable.

In this case, if Cheek asserted that he truly believed that the Internal
Revenue Code did not purport to treat wages as income, and the jury
believed him, the Government would not have carried its burden to prove
willfulness, however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief. Of
course, in deciding whether to credit Cheek's good-faith belief claim,
the jury would be free to consider any admissible evidence from any
source showing that Cheek was aware of his duty to file a return and to
treat wages as income, including evidence showing his awareness of the
relevant provisions of the Code or regulations, of court decisions
rejecting his interpretation of the tax law, of authoritative rulings of
the Internal Revenue Service, or of any contents of the personal income
tax return forms and accompanying instructions that made it plain that
wages should be returned as income.

It was therefore error to instruct the jury to disregard evidence of
Cheek's understanding that, within the meaning of the tax laws, he was
not a person required to file a return or to pay income taxes and that
wages are not taxable income, as incredible as such misunderstandings of
and beliefs about the law might be. Of course, the more unreasonable the
asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are, the more likely the jury will
consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known
legal duties imposed by the tax laws and will find that the Government
has carried its burden of proving knowledge.

Cheek asserted in the trial court that he should be acquitted because he
believed in good faith that the income tax law is unconstitutional as
applied to him and thus could not legally impose any duty upon him of
which he should have been aware. Such a submission is unsound....

Claims that some of the provisions of the tax code are unconstitutional
are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent
mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather,
they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied
conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and
unenforceable. Thus in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but
after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he
concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require
him to pay a tax.

We do not believe that Congress contemplated that such a taxpayer,
without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed
upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the
mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to
the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that
Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported
to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of
invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. Also, without
paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in
the Tax Court, with the right to appeal to a higher court if
unsuccessful. Cheek took neither course in some years, and when he did
was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position
to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal
Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal
prosecution under §§ 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this
very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated,
but like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts, who "willfully"
refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must
take the risk of being wrong.

We thus hold that in a case like this, a defendant's views about the
validity of the tax statutes are irrelevant to the issue of willfulness
and need not be heard by the jury, and, if they are, an instruction to
disregard them would be proper. For this purpose, it makes no difference
whether the claims of invalidity are frivolous or have substance. It was
therefore not error in this case for the District Judge to instruct the
jury not to consider Cheek's claims that the tax laws were
unconstitutional. However, it was error for the court to instruct the
jury that petitioner's asserted beliefs that wages are not income and
that he was not a taxpayer within the meaning of the Internal Revenue
Code should not be considered by the jury in determining whether Cheek
had acted willfully.

 

Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.

It seems to me that we are concerned in this case not with "the
complexity of the tax laws," but with the income tax law in its most
elementary and basic aspect: Is a wage earner a taxpayer and are wages
income?

The Court acknowledges that the conclusively established standard for
willfulness under the applicable statutes is the "voluntary, intentional
violation of a known legal duty." That being so, it is incomprehensible
to me how, in this day, more than 70 years after the institution of our
present federal income tax system with the passage of the Income Tax Act
of 1913 any taxpayer of competent mentality can assert as his defense to
charges of statutory willfulness the proposition that the wage he
receives for his labor is not income, irrespective of a cult that says
otherwise and advises the gullible to resist income tax collections. One
might note in passing that this particular taxpayer, after all, was a
licensed pilot for one of our major commercial airlines; he presumably
was a person of at least minimum intellectual competence.

The District Court's instruction that an objectively reasonable and
good-faith misunderstanding of the law negates willfulness lends
further, rather than less, protection to this defendant, for it adds an
additional hurdle for the prosecution to overcome. Petitioner should be
grateful for this further protection, rather than be opposed to it.

This Court's opinion today, I fear, will encourage taxpayers to cling to
frivolous views of the law in the hope of convincing a jury of their
sincerity. If that ensues, I suspect we have gone beyond the limits of
common sense.

Liparota v. United States

 

### *Liparota v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

471 U.S. 419 (1985)

 

Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The federal statute governing food stamp fraud provides that "whoever
knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or
authorization cards in any manner not authorized by \[the statute\] or
the regulations" is subject to a fine and imprisonment. 78 Stat. 708, as
amended, 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1). The question presented is whether in a
prosecution under this provision the Government must prove that the
defendant knew that he was acting in a manner not authorized by statute
or regulations.

Petitioner Frank Liparota was the co-owner with his brother of Moon's
Sandwich Shop in Chicago, Illinois. He was indicted for acquiring and
possessing food stamps in violation of § 2024(b)(1). The Department of
Agriculture had not authorized petitioner's restaurant to accept food
stamps. At trial, the Government proved that petitioner on three
occasions purchased food stamps from an undercover Department of
Agriculture agent for substantially less than their face value. On the
first occasion, the agent informed petitioner that she had \$195 worth
of food stamps to sell. The agent then accepted petitioner's offer of
\$150 and consummated the transaction in a back room of the restaurant
with petitioner's brother. A similar transaction occurred one week
later, in which the agent sold \$500 worth of coupons for \$350.
Approximately one month later, petitioner bought \$500 worth of food
stamps from the agent for \$300.

The controversy between the parties concerns the mental state, if any,
that the Government must show in proving that petitioner acted "in any
manner not authorized by \[the statute\] or the regulations." The
Government argues that petitioner violated the statute if he knew that
he acquired or possessed food stamps and if in fact that acquisition or
possession was in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations.
According to the Government, no *mens rea,* or "evil-meaning *mind,"
Morissette* v. *United States,* 342 U. S. 246, 251 (1952), is necessary
for conviction. Petitioner claims that the Government's interpretation,
by dispensing with *mens rea,* dispenses with the only morally
blameworthy element in the definition of the crime. To avoid this
allegedly untoward result, he claims that an individual violates the
statute if he knows that he has acquired or possessed food stamps *and*
if he also knows that he has done so in an unauthorized manner. Our task
is to determine which meaning Congress intended.

Absent indication of contrary purpose in the language or legislative
history of the statute, we believe that § 2024(b)(1) requires a showing
that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or
regulations. "The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only
when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is
as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in
freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the
normal individual to choose between good and evil." Thus, in *United
States* v. *United States Gypsum Co.,* 438 U. S. 422, 438 (1978), we
noted that "\[c\]ertainly far more than the simple omission of the
appropriate phrase from the statutory definition is necessary to justify
dispensing with an intent requirement" and that criminal offenses
requiring no *mens rea* have a "generally disfavored status." Similarly,
in this case, the failure of Congress explicitly and unambiguously to
indicate whether *mens rea* is required does not signal a departure from
this background assumption of our criminal law.

This construction is particularly appropriate where, as here, to
interpret the statute otherwise would be to criminalize a broad range of
apparently innocent conduct. For instance, § 2024(b)(1) declares it
criminal to use, transfer, acquire, alter, or possess food stamps in any
manner not authorized by statute or regulations. The statute provides
further that "\[c\]oupons issued to eligible households shall be used by
them only to purchase food in retail food stores which have been
approved for participation in the food stamp program *at prices
prevailing in such stores.\"* 7 U.S.C. § 2016(b) (emphasis added); *see
also* 7 CFR § 274.10(a) (1985). This seems to be the *only* authorized
use. A strict reading of the statute with no knowledge-of-illegality
requirement would thus render criminal a food stamp recipient who, for
example, used stamps to purchase food from a store that, unknown to him,
charged higher than normal prices to food stamp program participants.
Such a reading would also render criminal a nonrecipient of food stamps
who "possessed" stamps because he was mistakenly sent them through the
mail due to administrative error, "altered" them by tearing them up, and
"transferred" them by throwing them away. Of course, Congress *could*
have intended that this broad range of conduct be made illegal, perhaps
with the understanding that prosecutors would exercise their discretion
to avoid such harsh results. However, given the paucity of material
suggesting that Congress did so intend, we are reluctant to adopt such a
sweeping interpretation.

In addition, requiring *mens rea* is in keeping with our longstanding
recognition of the principle that "ambiguity concerning the ambit of
criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity." Application of
the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair
warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate
balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in
defining criminal liability. See *United States* v. *Bass, supra,* at
348 ("\[B\]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because
criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the
community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal
activity"). Although the rule of lenity is not to be applied where to do
so would conflict with the implied or expressed intent of Congress, it
provides a time-honored interpretive guideline when the congressional
purpose is unclear. In the instant case, the rule directly supports
petitioner's contention that the Government must prove knowledge of
illegality to convict him under § 2024(b)(1).

We hold that in a prosecution for violation of § 2024(b)(1), the
Government must prove that the defendant knew that his acquisition or
possession of food stamps was in a manner unauthorized by statute or
regulations. This holding does not put an unduly heavy burden on the
Government in prosecuting violators of § 2024(b)(1). To prove that
petitioner knew that his acquisition or possession of food stamps was
unauthorized, for example, the Government need not show that he had
knowledge of specific regulations governing food stamp acquisition or
possession. Nor must the Government introduce any extraordinary evidence
that would conclusively demonstrate petitioner's state of mind. Rather,
as in any other criminal prosecution requiring *mens rea,* the
Government may prove by reference to facts and circumstances surrounding
the case that petitioner knew that his conduct was unauthorized or
illegal.

*Reversed.*

Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of this
case.

Justice White, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.

In relying on the "background assumption of our criminal law" that *mens
rea* is required, the Court ignores the equally well founded assumption
that ignorance of the law is no excuse. It is "the conventional position
that knowledge of the existence, meaning or application of the law
determining the elements of an offense is not an element of that offense
. . ." Model Penal Code.

This Court's prior cases indicate that a statutory requirement of a
"knowing violation" does not supersede this principle. For example,
under the statute at issue in *United States* v. *International Minerals
& Chemical Corp.,* 402 U. S. 558 (1971), the Interstate Commerce
Commission was authorized to promulgate regulations regarding the
transportation of corrosive liquids, and it was a crime to "knowingly
violat\[e\] any such regulation." 18 U.S.C. § 834(f) (1970). Viewing the
word "regulations" as "a shorthand designation for specific acts or
omissions which violate the Act," we adhered to the traditional rule
that ignorance of the law is not a defense. The violation had to be
"knowing" in that the defendant had to know that he was transporting
corrosive liquids and not, for example, merely water. But there was no
requirement that he be aware that he was violating a particular
regulation. Similarly, in this case the phrase "in any manner not
authorized by" the statute or regulations is a shorthand incorporation
of a variety of legal requirements. To be convicted, a defendant must
have been aware of what he was doing, but not that it was illegal.

In *Boyce Motor Lines, Inc.* *v. United States,* 342 U.S. 337 (1952),
the Court considered a statute that punished anyone who "knowingly
violates" a regulation requiring trucks transporting dangerous items to
avoid congested areas where possible. In rejecting a vagueness
challenge, the Court read "knowingly" to mean not that the driver had to
be aware of the regulation, but that he had to know a safer alternative
route was available. Likewise, in construing 18 U. S. C. § 1461, which
punishes "\[w\]hoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing \... of
anything declared by this section or section 3001(e) of Title 39 to be
nonmailable," we held that the defendant need not have known that the
materials were nonmailable. *Hamling* v. *United States,* 418 U.S. 87,
120-124 (1974). "To require proof of a defendant's knowledge of the
legal status of the materials would permit the defendant to avoid
prosecution by simply claiming that he had not brushed up on the law,"
and was not required by the statute.

In each of these cases, the statutory language lent itself to the
approach adopted today if anything more readily than does § 2024(b)(1).
I would read § 2024(b)(1) like those statutes, to require awareness of
only the relevant aspects of one's conduct rendering it illegal, not the
fact of illegality. This reading does not abandon the "background
assumption" of *mens rea* by creating a strict-liability offense, and is
consistent with the equally important background assumption that
ignorance of the law is not a defense.

I wholly agree that "\[t\]he contention that an injury can amount to a
crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient
notion." *Morissette* v. *United States,* 342 U. S. 246, 250 (1952). But
the holding of the court below is not at all inconsistent with that
longstanding and important principle. Petitioner's conduct was
intentional; the jury found that petitioner "realized what he was doing,
and was aware of the nature of his conduct, and did not act through
ignorance, mistake, or accident." Whether he knew which regulation he
violated is beside the point.

Ratzlaf v. United States

 

### *Ratzlaf v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

510 U.S. 135 (1994)

 

Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

**I**

On the evening of October 20, 1988, defendant-petitioner Waldemar
Ratzlaf ran up a debt of \$160,000 playing blackjack at the High Sierra
Casino in Reno, Nevada. The casino gave him one week to pay. On the due
date, Ratzlaf returned to the casino with cash of \$100,000 in hand. A
casino official informed Ratzlaf that all transactions involving more
than \$10,000 in cash had to be reported to state and federal
authorities. The official added that the casino could accept a cashier's
check for the full amount due without triggering any reporting
requirement. The casino helpfully placed a limousine at Ratzlaf's
disposal, and assigned an employee to accompany him to banks in the
vicinity. Informed that banks, too, are required to report cash
transactions in excess of \$10,000, Ratzlaf purchased cashier's checks,
each for less than \$10,000 and each from a different bank. He delivered
these checks to the High Sierra Casino.

Based on this endeavor, Ratzlaf was charged with "structuring
transactions" to evade the banks' obligation to report cash transactions
exceeding \$10,000; this conduct, the indictment alleged, violated 31
U.S.C. §§ 5322(a) and 5324(3). The trial judge instructed the jury that
the Government had to prove defendant's knowledge of the banks'
reporting obligation and his attempt to evade that obligation, but did
not have to prove defendant knew the structuring was unlawful. Ratzlaf
was convicted, fined, and sentenced to prison.

Ratzlaf maintained on appeal that he could not be convicted of
"willfully violating" the antistructuring law solely on the basis of his
knowledge that a financial institution must report currency transactions
in excess of \$10,000 and his intention to avoid such reporting. To gain
a conviction for "willful" conduct, he asserted, the Government must
prove he was aware of the illegality of the "structuring" in which he
engaged. The Ninth Circuit upheld the trial court's construction of the
legislation and affirmed Ratzlaf's conviction. 976 F. 2d 1280 (1992). We
granted certiorari and now conclude that, to give effect to the
statutory "willfulness" specification, the Government had to prove
Ratzlaf knew the structuring he undertook was unlawful. We therefore
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

**II**

**A**

Congress enacted the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act
(Bank Secrecy Act) in 1970, Pub. L. 91-2508, Tit. II, 84 Stat. 1118, in
response to increasing use of banks and other institutions as financial
intermediaries by persons engaged in criminal activity. The Act imposes
a variety of reporting requirements on individuals and institutions
regarding foreign and domestic financial transactions. See 31 U.S.C. §§
5311-5325. The reporting requirement relevant here, § 5313(a), applies
to domestic financial transactions. Section 5313(a) reads:

"When a domestic financial institution is involved in a transaction for
the payment, receipt, or transfer of United States coins or currency (or
other monetary instruments the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes), in
an amount, denomination, or amount and denomination, or under
circumstances the Secretary prescribes by regulation, the institution
and any other participant in the transaction the Secretary may prescribe
shall file a report on the transaction at the time and in the way the
Secretary prescribes\..."

To deter circumvention of this reporting requirement, Congress enacted
an antistructuring provision, 31 U.S.C. § 5324, as part of the Money
Laundering Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570, Tit. I, Subtit. H, §
1354(a), 100 Stat. 3207-22.4 Section 5324 which Ratzlaf is charged with
"willfully violating," reads:

"No person shall for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements
of section 5313(a) with respect to such transaction---

"(3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or
assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic
financial institutions."

The criminal enforcement provision at issue, 31 U.S.C. § 5322(a), sets
out penalties for "\[a\] person willfully violating," *inter alia,* the
antistructuring provision. Section 5322(a) reads:

"A person willfully violating this subchapter \[31 U.S.C. §5311 *et*
seg. or a regulation prescribed under this subchapter (except section
5315 of this title or a regulation prescribed under section 5315) shall
be fined not more than \$250,000, or \[imprisoned for\] not more than
five years, or both."

**B**

Section 5324 forbids structuring transactions with a "purpose of evading
the reporting requirements of section 5313(a)." Ratzlaf admits that he
structured cash transactions, and that he did so with knowledge of, and
a purpose to avoid, the banks' duty to report currency transactions in
excess of \$10,000. The statutory formulation (§ 5322) under which
Ratzlaf was prosecuted, however, calls for proof of "willful\[ness\]" on
the actor's part. The trial judge in Ratzlaf's case, with the Ninth
Circuit's approbation, treated § 5322(a)'s "willfulness" requirement
essentially as surplus-age --- as words of no consequence. Judges should
hesitate so to treat statutory terms in any setting, and resistance
should be heightened when the words describe an element of a criminal
offense. See *Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare* v. *Davenport,* 495
U. S. 552, 562 (1990) (expressing "deep reluctance" to interpret
statutory provisions "so as to render superfluous other provisions in
the same enactment") (citation omitted); cf. *Potter* v. *United
States,* 155 U. S. 438, 446 (1894) (word "wilful" used to describe
certain offenses but not others in same statute "cannot be regarded as
mere surplusage; it means something").

"Willful," this Court has recognized, is a "word of many meanings," and
"its construction \[is\] often . . . influenced by its context." *Spies*
v. *United States,* 317 U. S. 492, 497 (1943). Accordingly, we view §§
5322(a) and 5324(3) mindful of the complex of provisions in which they
are embedded. In this light, we count it significant that § 5322(a)'s
omnibus "willfulness" requirement, when applied to other provisions in
the same subchapter, consistently has been read by the Courts of Appeals
to require both "knowledge of the reporting requirement" *and* a
"specific intent to commit the crime," *i.e.,* "a purpose to disobey the
law." See *United States* v. *Bank of New England, N. A.,* 821 F. 2d
844, 854-859 (CA1 1987) ("willful violation" of § 5313's reporting
requirement for cash transactions over \$10,000 requires "voluntary,
intentional, and bad purpose to disobey the law"); *United States* v.
*Eisenstein,* 731 F. 2d 1540, 1543 (CA11 1984) ("willful violation" of §
5313's reporting requirement for cash transactions over \$10,000
requires " 'proof of the defendant's knowledge of the reporting
requirement and his specific intent to commit the crime'") (quoting
*United States* v. *Granda,* 565 F. 2d 922, 926 (CA5 1978)).

The United States urges, however, that § 5324 violators, by their very
conduct, exhibit a purpose to do wrong, which suffices to show
"willfulness":

"On occasion, criminal statutes --- including some requiring proof of
'willfulness' --- have been understood to require proof of an
intentional violation of a known legal duty, *i. e.,* specific knowledge
by the defendant that his conduct is unlawful. But where that
construction has been adopted, it has been invoked only to ensure that
the defendant acted with a wrongful purpose. See *Liparota* v. *United
States,* 471 U. S. 419, 426 (1985).

"The anti-structuring statute, 31 U.S.C. § 5324, satisfies the 'bad
purpose' component of willfulness by explicitly defining the wrongful
purpose necessary to violate the law: it requires proof that the
defendant acted with the purpose to evade the reporting requirement of
Section 5313(a)."

"Structuring is not the kind of activity that an ordinary person would
engage in innocently." the United States asserts. It is therefore
"reasonable," the Government concludes, "to hold a structurer
responsible for evading the reporting requirements without the need to
prove specific knowledge that such evasion is unlawful."

Undoubtedly there are bad men who attempt to elude official reporting
requirements in order to hide from Government inspectors such criminal
activity as laundering drug money or tax evasion. But currency
structuring is not inevitably nefarious. Consider, for example, the
small business operator who knows that reports filed under 31 U.S.C. §
5313(a) are available to the Internal Revenue Service. To reduce the
risk of an IRS audit, she brings \$9,500 in cash to the bank twice each
week, in lieu of transporting over \$10,000 once each week. That person,
if the United States is right, has committed a criminal offense, because
she structured cash transactions "for the specific purpose of depriving
the Government of the information that Section 5313(a) is designed to
obtain." Nor is a person who structures a currency transaction
invariably motivated by a desire to keep the Government in the dark. But
under the Government's construction an individual would commit a felony
against the United States by making cash deposits in small doses,
fearful that the bank's reports would increase the likelihood of
burglary, or in an endeavor to keep a former spouse unaware of his
wealth.

Courts have noted "many occasions" on which persons, without violating
any law, may structure transactions "in order to avoid the impact of
some regulation or tax." This Court, over a century ago, supplied an
illustration:

"The Stamp Act of 1862 imposed a duty of two cents upon a bank-check,
when drawn for an amount not less than twenty dollars. A careful
individual, having the amount of twenty dollars to pay, pays the same by
handing to his creditor two checks of ten dollars each. He thus draws
checks in payment of his debt to the amount of twenty dollars, and yet
pays no stamp duty\... While his operations deprive the government of
the duties it might reasonably expect to receive, it is not perceived
that the practice is open to the charge of fraud. He resorts to devices
to avoid the payment of duties, but they are not illegal. He has the
legal right to split up his evidences of payment, and thus to avoid the
tax." *United States* v. *Isham,* 17 Wall. 496, 506 (1873).

In current days, as an *amicus* noted, countless taxpayers each year
give a gift of \$10,000 on December 31 and an identical gift the next
day, thereby legitimately avoiding the taxable gifts reporting required
by 26 U.S.C. § 2503(b).

In light of these examples, we are unpersuaded by the argument that
structuring is so obviously "evil" or inherently "bad" that the
"willfulness" requirement is satisfied irrespective of the defendant's
knowledge of the illegality of structuring. Had Congress wished to
dispense with the requirement, it could have furnished the appropriate
instruction.

**C**

In § 5322, Congress subjected to criminal penalties only those
"willfully violating" § 5324, signaling its intent to require for
conviction proof that the defendant knew not only of the bank's duty to
report cash transactions in excess of \$10,000, but also of his duty not
to avoid triggering such a report. There are, we recognize, contrary
indications in the statute's legislative history. But we do not resort
to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.
Moreover, were we to find § 5322(a)'s "willfulness" requirement
ambiguous as applied to § 5324, we would resolve any doubt in favor of
the defendant. *Hughey* v. *United States,* 495 U. S. 411, 422 (1990)
(lenity principles "demand resolution of ambiguities in criminal
statutes in favor of the defendant"); *Crandon* v. *United States,* 494
U.S. 152, 160 (1990) ("Because construction of a criminal statute must
be guided by the need for fair warning, it is rare that legislative
history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute
broader than that clearly warranted by the text."); *United States* v.
*Bass,* 404 U.S. 336, 347-350 (1971) (rule of lenity premised on
concepts that " 'fair warning should be given to the world in language
that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if
a certain line is passed' " and that "legislatures and not courts should
define criminal activity") (quoting *McBoyle* v. *United States,* 283
U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.)).

We do not dishonor the venerable principle that ignorance of the law
generally is no defense to a criminal charge. See *Cheek* v. *United
States,* 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). In particular contexts, however,
Congress may decree otherwise. That, we hold, is what Congress has done
with respect to 31 U.S.C. § 5322(a) and the provisions it controls. To
convict Ratzlaf of the crime with which he was charged, violation of 31
U.S.C. §§ 5322(a) and 5324(3), the jury had to find he knew the
structuring in which he engaged was unlawful. Because the jury was not
properly instructed in this regard, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth
Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

*It is so ordered.*

 

Justice BLACKMUN, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'CONNOR, and
Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.

The petitioner in this case was informed by casino officials that a
transaction involving more than \$10,000 in cash must be reported, was
informed by the various banks he visited that banks are required to
report cash transactions in excess of \$10,000, and then purchased
\$76,000 in cashier's checks, each for less than \$10,000 and each from
a different bank. Petitioner Ratzlaf, obviously not a person of limited
intelligence, was anything but uncomprehending as he traveled from bank
to bank converting his bag of cash to cashier's checks in \$9,500
bundles. I am convinced that his actions constituted a "willful"
violation of the antistructuring provision embodied in 31 U.S.C. § 5324.
As a result of today's decision, Waldemar Ratzlaf --- to use an old
phrase --- will be "laughing all the way to the bank."

The majority's interpretation of the antistructuring provision is at
odds with the statutory text, the intent of Congress, and the
fundamental principle that knowledge of illegality is not required for a
criminal act. Now Congress must try again to fill a hole it rightly felt
it had filled before. I dissent.

Official Reliance

 

Finally, we look at those situations where the law prohibits the
defendant\'s conduct, but she has either been told that it does not or
else she has not been given notice that her otherwise innocent conduct
is illegal. This section examines when such a defendant will be excused,
even if her conduct satisfies all the elements of the statute.

Hopkins v. State

 

### *Hopkins v. State*

Court of Appeals of Maryland

69 A.2d 456 (Md. App. 1949)

 

This appeal was taken by the Rev. William F. Hopkins, of Elkton, from
the judgment of conviction entered upon the verdict of a jury in the
Circuit Court for Cecil County for violation of the statute making it
unlawful to erect or maintain any sign intended to aid in the
solicitation or performance of marriages.

The State charged that on September 1, 1947, defendant maintained a sign
at the entrance to his home at 148 East Main Street in Elkton, and also
a sign along a highway leading into the town, to aid in the solicitation
and performance of marriages. Four photographs were admitted in
evidence. One photograph, taken on an afternoon in September, 1947,
shows the sign in Elkton containing the name \"Rev. W.F. Hopkins.\"
Another, taken at night shows the same sign illuminated at night by
electricity. The third shows the other sign along the highway containing
the words, \"W.F. Hopkins, Notary Public, Information.\" The fourth
shows this sign illuminated at night.

The State showed that during the month of August, 1947, thirty ministers
performed 1,267 marriages in Cecil County, and of this number defendant
performed 286, only three of which were ceremonies in which the parties
were residents of Cecil County. Defendant contended that the judge erred
in excluding testimony offered to show that the State\'s Attorney
advised him in 1944 before he erected the signs, that they would not
violate the law. It is generally held that the advice of counsel, even
though followed in good faith, furnishes no excuse to a person for
violating the law and cannot be relied upon as a defense in a criminal
action. Moreover, advice given by a public official, even a State\'s
Attorney, that a contemplated act is not criminal will not excuse an
offender if, as a matter of law, the act performed did amount to a
violation of the law. These rules are founded upon the maxim that
ignorance of the law will not excuse its violation. If an accused could
be exempted from punishment for crime by reason of the advice of
counsel, such advice would become paramount to the law.

While ignorance of fact may sometimes be admitted as evidence of lack of
criminal intent, ignorance of the law ordinarily does not give immunity
from punishment for crime, for every man is presumed to intend the
necessary and legitimate consequences of what he knowingly does. In the
case at bar defendant did not claim that the State\'s Attorney misled
him regarding any facts of the case, but only that the State\'s Attorney
advised him as to the law based upon the facts. Defendant was aware of
the penal statute enacted by the Legislature. He knew what he wanted to
do, and he did the thing he intended to do. He claims merely that he was
given advice regarding his legal rights. If there was any mistake, it
was a mistake of law and not of fact. If the right of a person to erect
a sign of a certain type and size depends upon the construction and
application of a penal statute, and the right is somewhat doubtful, he
erects the sign at his peril. In other words, a person who commits an
act which the law declares to be criminal cannot be excused from
punishment upon the theory that he misconstrued or misapplied the law.
For these reasons the exclusion of the testimony offered to show that
defendant had sought and received advice from the State\'s Attorney was
not prejudicial error.

Lambert v. California

 

### *Lambert v. California*

United States Supreme Court

355 U.S. 225 (1957)

 

Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Section 52.38(a) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code defines "convicted
person" as follows:

"Any person who, subsequent to January 1, 1921, has been or hereafter is
convicted of an offense punishable as a felony in the State of
California, or who has been or who is hereafter convicted of any offense
in any place other than the State of California, which offense, if
committed in the State of California, would have been punishable as a
felony."

Section 52.39 provides that it shall be unlawful for "any convicted
person" to be or remain in Los Angeles for a period of more than five
days without registering; it requires any person having a place of abode
outside the city to register if he comes into the city on five occasions
or more during a 30-day period; and it prescribes the information to be
furnished the Chief of Police on registering.

Section 52.43(b) makes the failure to register a continuing offense,
each day's failure constituting a separate offense.

Appellant, arrested on suspicion of another offense, was charged with a
violation of this registration law. The evidence showed that she had
been at the time of her arrest a resident of Los Angeles for over seven
years. Within that period she had been convicted in Los Angeles of the
crime of forgery, an offense which California punishes as a felony.
Though convicted of a crime punishable as a felony, she had not at the
time of her arrest registered under the Municipal Code. At the trial,
appellant asserted that § 52.39 of the Code denies her due process of
law and other rights under the Federal Constitution, unnecessary to
enumerate. The trial court denied this objection. The case was tried to
a jury which found appellant guilty. The court fined her \$250 and
placed her on probation for three years. The registration provision,
carrying criminal penalties, applies if a person has been convicted "of
an offense punishable as a felony in the State of California" or, in
case he has been convicted in another State, if the offense "would have
been punishable as a felony" had it been committed in California. No
element of willfulness is by terms included in the ordinance nor read
into it by the California court as a condition necessary for a
conviction.

We must assume that appellant had no actual knowledge of the requirement
that she register under this ordinance, as she offered proof of this
defense which was refused. The question is whether a registration act of
this character violates due process where it is applied to a person who
has no actual knowledge of his duty to register, and where no showing is
made of the probability of such knowledge.

We do not go with Blackstone in saying that "a vicious will" is
necessary to constitute a crime, for conduct alone without regard to the
intent of the doer is often sufficient. There is wide latitude in the
lawmakers to declare an offense and to exclude elements of knowledge and
diligence from its definition. But we deal here with conduct that is
wholly passive --- mere failure to register. It is unlike the commission
of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the
doer to the consequences of his deed The rule that "ignorance of the law
will not excuse is deep in our law, as is the principle that of all the
powers of local government, the police power is "one of the least
limitable." On the other hand, due process places some limits on its
exercise. Engrained in our concept of due process is the requirement of
notice. Notice is sometimes essential so that the citizen has the chance
to defend charges. Notice is required before property interests are
disturbed, before assessments are made, before penalties are assessed.
Notice is required in a myriad of situations where a penalty or
forfeiture might be suffered for mere failure to act.

Registration laws are common and their range is wide. Many such laws are
akin to licensing statutes in that they pertain to the regulation of
business activities. But the present ordinance is entirely different.
Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever,
mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which
might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are
completely lacking. At most the ordinance is but a law enforcement
technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies
through which a list of the names and addresses of felons then residing
in a given community is compiled. The disclosure is merely a compilation
of former convictions already publicly recorded in the jurisdiction
where obtained. Nevertheless, this appellant on first becoming aware of
her duty to register was given no opportunity to comply with the law and
avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. She
could but suffer the consequences of the ordinance, namely, conviction
with the imposition of heavy criminal penalties thereunder. We believe
that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the
probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are
necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand. As Holmes
wrote in The Common Law, "A law which punished conduct which would not
be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too
severe for that community to bear." Its severity lies in the absence of
an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend
any prosecution brought under it. Where a person did not know of the
duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such
knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process. Were
it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is
written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the
community.

Reversed.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter, whom Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice
Whittaker join, dissenting.

The present laws of the United States and of the forty-eight States are
thick with provisions that command that some things not be done and
others be done, although persons convicted under such provisions may
have had no awareness of what the law required or that what they did was
wrongdoing. The body of decisions sustaining such legislation, including
innumerable registration laws, is almost as voluminous as the
legislation itself. The matter is summarized in *United States v.
Balint*, 258 U. S. 250, 252: "Many instances of this are to be found in
regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power
where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some
social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases
of mala in se."

Surely there can hardly be a difference as a matter of fairness, of
hardship, or of justice, if one may invoke it, between the case of a
person wholly innocent of wrongdoing, in the sense that he was not
remotely conscious of violating any law, who is imprisoned for five
years for conduct relating to narcotics, and the case of another person
who is placed on probation for three years on condition that she pay
\$250, for failure, as a local resident, convicted under local law of a
felony, to register under a law passed as an exercise of the State's
"police power." Considerations of hardship often lead courts, naturally
enough, to attribute to a statute the requirement of a certain mental
element --- some consciousness of wrongdoing and knowledge of the law's
command --- as a matter of statutory construction. Then, too, a cruelly
disproportionate relation between what the law requires and the sanction
for its disobedience may constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment
as a cruel and unusual punishment, and, in respect to the States, even
offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

But what the Court here does is to draw a constitutional line between a
State's requirement of doing and not doing. What is this but a return to
Year Book distinctions between feasance and nonfeasance --- a
distinction that may have significance in the evolution of common-law
notions of liability, but is inadmissible as a line between
constitutionality and unconstitutionality. One can be confident that Mr.
Justice Holmes would have been the last to draw such a line. What he
wrote about "blameworthiness" is worth quoting in its context:

"It is not intended to deny that criminal liability, as well as civil,
is founded on blameworthiness. Such a denial would shock the moral sense
of any civilized community; or, to put it another way, a law which
punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of
the community would be too severe for that community to bear." (This
passage must be read in the setting of the broader discussion of which
it is an essential part. Holmes, The Common Law, at 49-50.)

If the generalization that underlies, and alone can justify, this
decision were to be given its relevant scope, a whole volume of the
United States Reports would be required to document in detail the
legislation in this country that would fall or be impaired. I abstain
from entering upon a consideration of such legislation, and
adjudications upon it, because I feel confident that the present
decision will turn out to be an isolated deviation from the strong
current of precedents --- a derelict on the waters of the law.
Accordingly, I content myself with dissenting.

 

 

 

2.2.5.4

Note based on US v. Wilson

 

### Note on *United States v. Wilson*, 159 F.3d 280 (7th Cir. 1998).

As part of divorce proceedings, Wilson\'s wife sought and obtained a
restraining order requiring him to stay away from her. No one explained
to Wilson at the time that a recently enacted federal statute, 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(g)(8), made it illegal for anyone subject to such an order to
possess a firearm. When Wilson was pulled over on an unrelated arrest
warrant, officers found two weapons in his possession and he was
ultimately charged and convicted of violating the federal statute. The
7th Circuit upheld his conviction over the dissent of Judge Richard
Posner who wrote:

It is wrong to convict a person of a crime if he had no reason to
believe that the act for which he was convicted was a crime, or even
that it was wrongful. This is one of the bedrock principles of American
law. It lies at the heart of any civilized system of law. Yet like most
legal generalizations, it can be maintained only with careful
qualification. We generally do not require prosecutors to prove that the
defendant knew that he was violating the law, even in cases in which the
law is sufficiently remote from the moral code of the society that such
knowledge cannot be presumed or its absence taken as evidence of
culpable moral obtuseness. We say instead that \"ignorance of the law is
no defense,\" and do not pause to consider the consistency of this maxim
with what we elsewhere affirm to be a fundamental constituent of the
rule of law and the Constitution of the United States. In the unusual
circumstances of this case, the maxim of expedience should yield to the
bedrock principle; and there is enough room in the statutory language to
achieve this end without having to trundle out the heavy artillery of
constitutional law.

Congress created, and the Department of Justice sprang, a trap on
Carlton Wilson as a result of which he will serve more than three years
in federal prison for an act (actually an omission to act) that he could
not have suspected was a crime or even a civil wrong. We can release him
from the trap by interpreting the statute under which he was convicted
to require the government to prove that the violator knew that he was
committing a crime. This is the standard device by which the courts
avoid having to explore the outer boundaries of the constitutional
requirement of fair notice of potential criminal liability. *See*,
*e.g.*, *Ratzlaf v. United States*, 510 U.S. 135 (1994); *Staples v.
United States*, 511 U.S. 600, 618-19 (1994).

The stalking provision was enacted in 1994 and the number of
prosecutions for violating it has been minuscule (perhaps fewer than 10,
though I have not been able to discover the exact number, which is not a
reported statistic) in relation to the probable number of violations. I
estimate that every year the law has been in effect almost one hundred
thousand restraining orders against domestic violence have been issued.
Since 40 percent of U.S. households own guns, there can be very little
doubt that a large percentage of those orders were issued against gun
owners.

How many of these gun owners, when they got notice of the restraining
order, dispossessed themselves of their guns? I doubt that any did. The
law is malum prohibitum, not malum in se; that is, it is not the kind of
law that a lay person would intuit existed because the conduct it
forbade was contrary to the moral code of his society. Compare *United
States v. Robinson*, 137 F.3d 652, 654 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"child
pornography offends the moral sensibility of the community at large\"),
with *United States v. Grigsby*, 111 F.3d 806, 816-21 (11th Cir. 1997)
(importation of ivory in violation of the African Elephant Conservation
Act not criminal without knowledge of the Act). Yet the Department of
Justice took no steps to publicize the existence of the law until long
after Wilson violated it, even to the extent of advising the state
judiciaries of it so that judges could warn defendants in
domestic-relations disputes. At argument the prosecutor told us that the
Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois has
made no effort to advise the local judiciary of the law. Later he sent
us two bulletins from Department of Justice headquarters in Washington
to the U.S. Attorneys\' Offices throughout the country directing the
U.S. Attorneys to \"educate your state and local counterparts on these
provisions. Their assistance, particularly in working with local judges
to fashion domestic violence protective orders, is essential to the
effective implementation of the \[provisions\].\" But these bulletins
--- a tacit admission that four years after the enactment of the law,
the word hasn\'t gotten out even to judges --- were not circulated until
after Wilson\'s trial.

The federal criminal code contains thousands of separate prohibitions,
many ridiculously obscure, such as the one against using the coat of
arms of Switzerland in advertising, 18 U.S.C. § 708, or using \"Johnny
Horizon\" as a trade name without the authorization of the Department of
the Interior. 18 U.S.C. § 714. The prohibition in § 922(g)(8) is one of
the most obscure. A person owns a hunting rifle. He knows or should know
that if he is convicted of a felony he will have to get rid of the gun;
if he doesn\'t know, the judge or the probation service will tell him.
But should he be made subject to a restraining order telling him to keep
away from his ex-wife, whom he has not ever threatened with his hunting
rifle (the judge who issued the restraining order could but did not
issue an order forbidding Wilson to possess a firearm as long as the
order was in force), it will not occur to him that he must give up the
gun unless the judge issuing the order tells him. The judge didn\'t tell
Wilson; so far as appears, the judge was unaware of the law. Wilson\'s
lawyer didn\'t tell him either --- Wilson didn\'t have a lawyer. No one
told him. And there is no reason that he should have guessed, for while
he had beaten his wife and threatened to kill her, there is no
indication that guns played any part in the beating or the threats. The
fact that the restraining order contained no reference to guns may have
lulled him into thinking that, as long as he complied with the order and
stayed away from his wife, he could carry on as before.

When a defendant is morally culpable for failing to know or guess that
he is violating some law (as would be the case of someone who committed
a burglary without thinking --- so warped was his moral sense --- that
burglary might be a crime), we rely on conscience to provide all the
notice that is required. Sometimes the existence of the law is common
knowledge, as in the case of laws forbidding people to own hand grenades
(*see* *United States v. Freed*, 401 U.S. 601, 609 (1971)), forbidding
convicted felons to own any firearms, and requiring a license to carry a
handgun. And sometimes, though the law is obscure to the population at
large and nonintuitive, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to
learn about it, as in the case of persons engaged in the shipment of
pharmaceuticals who run afoul of the criminal prohibitions in the
federal food and drug laws. See *United States v. Dotterweich*, 320 U.S.
277 (1943). We want people to familiarize themselves with the laws
bearing on their activities. But a reasonable opportunity doesn\'t mean
being able to go to the local law library and read Title 18. It would be
preposterous to suppose that someone from Wilson\'s milieu is able to
take advantage of such an opportunity. If none of the conditions that
make it reasonable to dispense with proof of knowledge of the law is
present, then to intone \"ignorance of the law is no defense\" is to
condone a violation of fundamental principles for the sake of a modest
economy in the administration of criminal justice.

Do you agree with Judge Posner, probably one of the most famous American
judges never to reach the Supreme Court, that the passage of § 922(g)(8)
was a trap for the unwary? Does it matter that Wilson was found with a
12 gauge shotgun and an AK-47 in his truck?

Homicide

 

Every homicide involves a defendant unlawfully causing the death of
another. Thus, cases like killings in time of war or killings in self
defense are not homicide \-- they are lawful killings. What
distingsuishes homicides from one another is the defendant\'s relative
blame in causing the death. When the defendant acts intentionally, we
generally (though not always) call the killing murder; when she is
careless her killing might be deemed manslaughter; in some cases of
accidental killings we leave it to the tort system to determine adequate
compensation.\
\
Homicide, then, is an opportunity to reflect on what we have learned of
mens rea and to test those ideas in context.

 

 

 

 

3.1

Statutes

 

As the examples below make clear, each jurisdiction defines the various
homicide crimes slightly differently. We will draw some generalizations
about both the traditional, common law approach and the approach taken
by the drafters of the Model Penal Code. It is important to remember
though, that when practicing in a particular jurisdiction, it is always
the statute drawn up by the legislature that defines the prohibited
conduct.

 

 

 

 

3.1.1

Pennsylvania Statute

 

§ 2501. Criminal homicide.

\(a\) Offense defined.\--A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he
intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of
another human being.

\(b\) Classification.\--Criminal homicide shall be classified as murder,
voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter.

§ 2502. Murder.

\(a\) Murder of the first degree.\--A criminal homicide constitutes
murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional
killing.

\(b\) Murder of the second degree.\--A criminal homicide constitutes
murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was
engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.

\(c\) Murder of the third degree.\--All other kinds of murder shall be
murder of the third degree. Murder of the third degree is a felony of
the first degree.

§ 2503. Voluntary manslaughter.

\(a\) General rule.\--A person who kills an individual without lawful
justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the
killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from
serious provocation by:

\(1\) the individual killed; or

\(2\) another whom the actor endeavors to kill, but he negligently or
accidentally causes the death of the individual killed.

\(b\) Unreasonable belief killing justifiable.\--A person who
intentionally or knowingly kills an individual commits voluntary
manslaughter if at the time of the killing he believes the circumstances
to be such that, if they existed, would justify the killing under
Chapter 5 of this title (relating to general principles of
justification), but his belief is unreasonable.

\(c\) Grading.\--Voluntary manslaughter is a felony of the first degree.

§ 2504. Involuntary manslaughter.

\(a\) General rule.\--A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter
when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or
grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or
grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.

\(b\) Grading.\--Involuntary manslaughter is a misdemeanor of the first
degree. Where the victim is under 12 years of age and is in the care,
custody or control of the person who caused the death, involuntary
manslaughter is a felony of the second degree.

§ 2505. Causing or aiding suicide.

\(a\) Causing suicide as criminal homicide.\--A person may be convicted
of criminal homicide for causing another to commit suicide only if he
intentionally causes such suicide by force, duress or deception.

\(b\) Aiding or soliciting suicide as an independent offense.\--A person
who intentionally aids or solicits another to commit suicide is guilty
of a felony of the second degree if his conduct causes such suicide or
an attempted suicide, and otherwise of a misdemeanor of the second
degree.

§ 2506. Drug delivery resulting in death.

\(a\) Offense defined.\--A person commits a felony of the first degree
if the person intentionally administers, dispenses, delivers, gives,
prescribes, sells or distributes any controlled substance or counterfeit
controlled substance in violation of section 13(a)(14) or (30) of the
act of April 14, 1972 (P.L.233, No.64), known as The Controlled
Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, and another person dies as a
result of using the substance.

\(b\) Penalty.\--A person convicted under subsection (a) shall be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment which shall be fixed by the court at
not more than 40 years.

execution of any innocent person; or

(d) Under circumstances evidencing an attitude of universal malice
manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life generally,

person, or persons, other than himself, and thereby causes the death of
another;  or

(e) He or she commits unlawful distribution, dispensation, or sale of a

\(3\)

(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection
(3), murder in the second degree is a class 2 felony.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection
(3), murder in the second degree is a class 3 felony where the act
causing the death was performed upon a sudden heat of passion, caused by
a serious and highly provoking act of the intended victim, affecting the
defendant sufficiently to excite an irresistible passion in a reasonable
person;  but, if between the provocation and the killing there is an
interval sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard,
the killing is a class 2 felony.

§ 18-3-104

(1) A person commits the crime of manslaughter if:

(a) Such person recklessly causes the death of another person; or

(b) Such person intentionally causes or aids another person to commit

a strict liability crime.

...

\(c\) Vehicular homicide, in violation of paragraph (a) of this
subsection (1), is a class 4 felony. Vehicular homicide, in violation of
paragraph (b) of this subsection (1), is a class 3 felony.

 

 

 

3.1.3

California Penal Code

 

 

 §187

\(a\) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with
malice aforethought.

§188

\(a\) For purposes of Section 187, malice may be express or implied.

\(1\) Malice is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention
to unlawfully take away the life of a fellow creature.

\(2\) Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or
when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and
malignant heart.

\(3\) Except as stated in subdivision (e) of Section 189, in order to be
convicted of murder, a principal in a crime shall act with malice
aforethought. Malice shall not be imputed to a person based solely on
his or her participation in a crime.

\(b\) If it is shown that the killing resulted from an intentional act
with express or implied malice, as defined in subdivision (a), no other
mental state need be shown to establish the mental state of malice
aforethought. Neither an awareness of the obligation to act within the
general body of laws regulating society nor acting despite that
awareness is included within the definition of malice.

§189. 

\(a\) All murder that is perpetrated by means of a destructive device or
explosive, a weapon of mass destruction, knowing use of ammunition
designed primarily to penetrate metal or armor, poison, lying in wait,
torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated
killing, or that is committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to
perpetrate, arson, rape, carjacking, robbery, burglary, mayhem,
kidnapping, train wrecking, or any act punishable under Section 206,
286, 287, 288, or 289, or former Section 288a, or murder that is
perpetrated by means of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle,
intentionally at another person outside of the vehicle with the intent
to inflict death, is murder of the first degree.

\(b\) All other kinds of murders are of the second degree.

...

\(d\) To prove the killing was "deliberate and premeditated," it is not
necessary to prove the defendant maturely and meaningfully reflected
upon the gravity of the defendant's act.

§192.  Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without
malice. It is of three kinds:

(a) Voluntary---upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.

(b) Involuntary---in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to
a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce
death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection.
This subdivision shall not apply to acts committed in the driving of a
vehicle.

(c) Vehicular---

(1) Except as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 191.5, driving a
vehicle in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony,
and with gross negligence; or driving a vehicle in the commission of a
lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, and with
gross negligence.

(2) Driving a vehicle in the commission of an unlawful act, not
amounting to a felony, but without gross negligence; or driving a
vehicle in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in
an unlawful manner, but without gross negligence.

(3) Driving a vehicle in connection with a violation of paragraph (3) of
subdivision (a) of Section 550, where the vehicular collision or
vehicular accident was knowingly caused for financial gain and
proximately resulted in the death of any person. This paragraph does not
prevent prosecution of a defendant for the crime of murder.

(d) This section shall not be construed as making any homicide in the
driving of a vehicle punishable that is not a proximate result of the
commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony, or of the
commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful
manner.

(e) "Gross negligence," as used in this section, does not prohibit or
preclude a charge of murder under Section 188 upon facts exhibiting
wantonness and a conscious disregard for life to support a finding of
implied malice, or upon facts showing malice, consistent with the
holding of the California Supreme Court in People v. Watson (1981) 30
Cal.3d 290.

(f) 

(1) For purposes of determining sudden quarrel or heat of passion
pursuant to subdivision (a), the provocation was not objectively
reasonable if it resulted from the discovery of, knowledge about, or
potential disclosure of the victim's actual or perceived gender, gender
identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, including under
circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible romantic
or sexual advance towards the defendant, or if the defendant and victim
dated or had a romantic or sexual relationship. Nothing in this section
shall preclude the jury from considering all relevant facts to determine
whether the defendant was in fact provoked for purposes of establishing
subjective provocation.

(2) For purposes of this subdivision, "gender" includes a person's
gender identity and gender-related appearance and behavior regardless of
whether that appearance or behavior is associated with the person's
gender as determined at birth.

 

 

 

3.1.4

MPC Section 210

 

§ 210.1. Criminal Homicide.

\(1\) A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he purposely,
knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human
being.

\(2\) Criminal homicide is murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide.

§ 210.2. Murder.

\(1\) Except as provided in Section 210.3(1 )(b), criminal homicide
constitutes murder when:

\(a\) it is committed purposely or knowingly; or

\(b\) it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme
indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and
indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in
the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing
or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by
force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious
escape.

\(2\) Murder is a felony of the first degree \[but a person convicted of
murder may be sentenced to death, as provided in Section 210.6\].

§ 210.3. Manslaughter.

\(1\) Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:

\(a\) it is committed recklessly; or

\(b\) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the
influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is
reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation
or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the
actor\'s situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.

\(2\) Manslaughter is a felony of the second degree.

§ 210.4. Negligent Homicide.

\(1\) Criminal homicide constitutes negligent homicide when it is
committed negligently.

\(2\) Negligent homicide is a felony of the third degree.

 

 

 

3.2

Grading Intentional Homicide

 

In all of the cases in this section, the defendant intentionally killed
the victim. However we will see that these killings fall into three
possible categories \-- first degree murder, second degree murder, and
voluntary manslaughter. We will focus on the lines drawn between these
categories.

 

 

 

 

3.2.1

First v. Second Degree Murder

 

The Pennsylvania legislature divided murder into degrees in 1794 in
order to limit the number of defendants who would be liable for the
death penalty; only those convicted of first degree murder could be put
to death. The line drawn then is one that persists in many jurisdictions
to this day \-- first degree murders require premeditation and
deliberation. In this section we discuss both the meaning of
premeditation and whether it (or something else) is a valid way of
distinguishing the worst of the worst killers.

Maestas v. People

 

### *Maestas v. People*

Supreme Court of Colorado

11 P.2d 227 (Colo. 1932)

 

The facts are substantially as follows: Ben Addis, a registered
pharmacist, was, on September 9, 1931, engaged as a salesman, and he,
together with his sister, Mrs. Millie Freeman, were traveling in an
automobile to the San Luis Valley for the purpose of soliciting orders
from merchants there. They arrived at Fort Garland, Costilla County,
Colo., at about 10 o\'clock on the evening of September 9, 1931, to find
that the merchant there, upon whom they desired to call, had closed his
place of business; they decided to spend the night there, sleeping in
their car, and transact their business in the morning. They parked their
car on vacant property near the roadside, closed their windows, locked
their car doors, and, after they had been asleep for about two hours,
Mrs. Freeman was awakened by defendant and one Fernandez attempting to
open the car door on Mrs. Freeman\'s side. Mrs. Freeman awakened her
brother, who asked defendant and Fernandez what they wanted, whereupon
Fernandez disappeared, and defendant went to Addis\' side of the car
and, with curses, demanded that he open the window. Addis, in turn,
demanded who defendant was, and was answered 'that didn\'t make any
difference who I am,' and defendant again demanded that the window be
opened, and asked for some identification card, which Addis gave him
through the window, opened wide enough to pass out a card, but not
sufficiently wide to allow defendant to push his hand through, as he
attempted to do. After defendant had the identification card which Addis
gave him, he complained that he could not read it in the darkness, and
Addis suggested that if defendant would go to the front of the car, he
(Addis) would turn on the lights. Defendant did as was suggested and
Addis turned on the lights, and while defendant was apparently reading
the card, Addis started the engine and attempted to back the car towards
Fort Garland. Defendant got on the bumper, and eventually on the running
board, and from there broke the window glass on Addis\' side of the car
with his fist. In the meanwhile, the car was brought to a stop, and
while Addis was attempting to put defendant off the running board, Mrs.
Freeman got out of the car and ran towards Fort Garland for assistance,
whereupon defendant ran after her, and when about to grab her, she
eluded him and ran back to her brother, who was then standing near the
rear of the car. Defendant then disappeared for a short time, leaving
Addis and his sister standing near the car, when he suddenly reappeared,
and immediately fired several shots from an automatic pistol at Addis,
inflicting wounds, from the effects of which Addis died the next day in
a hospital at Alamosa.

Defendant was indigent, and counsel who represented him at the trial,
and also here, was appointed by the court to defend him.

The information charged that defendant and Fernandez "did then and there
feloniously, wilfully and of their malice aforethought kill and murder."
At the conclusion of all the evidence, a motion for a directed verdict
of not guilty was granted, as to defendant Fernandez, and a verdict of
guilty returned by the jury, as to the defendant here.

No objection was made to any of the instructions given by the court, and
no tendered instruction was refused. Counsel for defendant states in his
brief: "We shall present our argument under one general head and the
point we wish to emphasize is that the evidence in this case failed to
show 'deliberate and premeditated design' on the part of the defendant,
Maestas, to kill at the time he fired the fatal shots that caused the
death of Addis, and therefore, he is not guilty of murder in the first
degree."

The jurors were instructed upon the question of premeditation and
deliberation, and we assume that in their deliberation, they followed
the law as given them. In *Van Houton v. People*, 22 Colo. 53, 66 we
held: \"In this case the proof must establish deliberation and
premeditation to support the verdict. Time, however, is not essential if
there was a design and determination to kill formed in the mind of the
defendant previous to or at the time the mortal wound was given. It
matters not how short the interval, if it was sufficient for one thought
to follow another, and the defendant actually formed the design to kill,
and deliberated and premeditated upon such design before firing the
fatal shot, this was sufficient to raise the crime to the highest grade
known to the law \... Under these acts premeditation and deliberation
are the subject of inference and presumption to be drawn by the jury
from the facts and circumstances leading up to, surrounding, and
explanatory of the homicide.' *Van Houton*, supra, has been cited with
approval on this point a number of times, and as recently as *Robinson
v. People*, 76 Colo. 416 The rule announced therein states a correct
principle of law, and is one of almost universal acceptation.  There was
ample evidence from which the jury might well find deliberation and
premeditation.

Commonwealth v. Carroll

 

### *Commonwealth v. Carroll*

Pennsylvania Supreme Court

194 A.2d 911 (Penn. 1963)

 

OPINION BY MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BELL, November 12, 1963:

The defendant, Carroll, pleaded guilty generally to an indictment
charging him with the murder of his wife, and was tried by a Judge
without a jury. That Court found him guilty of first degree murder and
sentenced him to life imprisonment. Following argument and denial of
motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, defendant took this
appeal.

The defendant married the deceased in 1955, when he was serving in the
Army in California. Subsequently he was stationed in Alabama, and later
in Greenland. During the latter tour of duty, defendant\'s wife and two
children lived with his parents in New Jersey. Because this arrangement
proved incompatible, defendant returned to the United States on
emergency leave in order to move his family to their own quarters. On
his wife\'s insistence, defendant was forced first to secure a
\"compassionate transfer\" back to the States, and subsequently to
resign from the Army in July of 1960, by which time he had attained the
rank of Chief Warrant Officer. Defendant was a hard worker, earned a
substantial salary and bore a very good reputation among his neighbors.

In 1958, decedent-wife suffered a fractured skull while attempting to
leave defendant\'s car in the course of an argument. Allegedly this
contributed to her mental disorder which was later diagnosed as a
schizoid personality type. In 1959 she underwent psychiatric treatment
at the mental hygiene clinic in Aberdeen, Maryland. She complained of
nervousness and told the examining doctor \"I feel like hurting my
children.\" This sentiment sometimes took the form of sadistic
\"discipline\" toward their very young children. Nevertheless, upon her
discharge from the clinic, the doctors considered her much improved.
With this background we come to the immediate events of the crime.

In January, 1962, defendant was selected to attend an electronics school
in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for nine days. His wife greeted this
news with violent argument. Immediately prior to his departure for
Winston-Salem, at the suggestion and request of his wife, he put a
loaded .22 calibre pistol on the window sill at the head of their common
bed, so that she would feel safe. On the evening of January 16, 1962,
defendant returned home and told his wife that he had been temporarily
assigned to teach at a school in Chambersburg, which would necessitate
his absence from home four nights out of seven for a ten-week period. A
violent and protracted argument ensued at the dinner table and continued
until four o\'clock in the morning.

Defendant\'s own statement after his arrest details the final moments
before the crime:

We went into the bedroom a little before 3 o\'clock on Wednesday morning
where we continued to argue in short bursts. Generally she laid with her
back to me facing the wall in bed and would just talk over her shoulder
to me. I became angry and more angry especially what she was saying
about my kids and myself, and sometime between 3 and 4 o\'clock in the
morning I remembered the gun on the window sill over my head. I think
she had dozed off. I reached up and grabbed the pistol and brought it
down and shot her twice in the back of the head.\[2\]

Defendant\'s testimony at the trial elaborated this theme. He started to
think about the children:

\[S\]eeing my older son\'s feet what happened to them. I could see the
bruises on him and Michael\'s chin was split open, four stitches. I
didn\'t know what to do. I wanted to help my boys. Sometime in there she
said something in there, she called me some kind of name. I kept
thinking of this. During this time I either thought or felt --- I
thought of the gun, just thought of the gun. I am not sure whether I
felt my hand move toward the gun --- I saw my hand move, the next thing
--- the only thing I can recollect after that is right after the shots
or right during the shots I saw the gun in my hand just pointed at my
wife\'s head. She was still lying on her back --- mean her side. I could
smell the gunpowder and I could hear something --- it sounded like
running water. I didn\'t know what it was at first, didn\'t realize what
I\'d done at first. Then I smelled it. I smelled blood before\...

Q. At the time you shot her, Donald, were you fully aware and intend to
do what you did?

A. I don\'t know positively. All I remember hearing was two shots and
feeling myself go cold all of a sudden.

Shortly thereafter defendant wrapped his wife\'s body in a blanket,
spread, and sheets, tied them on with a piece of plastic clothesline,
and took her down to the cellar. He tried to clean up as well as he
could. That night he took his wife\'s body, wrapped in a blanket with a
rug over it to a desolate place near a trash dump. He then took the
children to his parents\' home in Magnolia, New Jersey. He was arrested
the next Monday in Chambersburg where he had gone to his teaching
assignment.

The applicable principles of law are well settled, but because they are
so frequently misunderstood or misapplied or overlooked, we deem it wise
to restate them. Many of them are set forth and reaffirmed in
*Commonwealth v. Gooslin*, 410 Pa. 285, 189 A.2d 157, where the Court
said (pages 286, 288, 289):

Murder . . . is defined as an unlawful killing of another with malice
aforethought, express or implied.\" The legislature divided murder into
two classifications, murder in the first degree and murder in the second
degree; and provided that (1) all murder perpetrated by poison or lying
in wait; or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate \[and\] premeditated
killing, or any murder which shall be committed in the perpetration of
or attempt to perpetrate certain specified felonies \[arson, rape,
robbery, burglary, or kidnapping\], is murder in the first degree and
(2) every other kind of murder is murder in the second degree: Act of
June 24, 1939.

Malice express or implied is \[the hallmark\] the criterion and
absolutely essential ingredient of murder. Malice in its legal sense
exists not only where there is a particular ill will, but also whenever
there is a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, wanton conduct,
cruelty, recklessness of consequences and a mind regardless of social
duty. Legal malice may be inferred and found from the attending
circumstances. Malice is present if the defendant had an intent to do
the deceased serious bodily harm.

The specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute in a
nonfelony murder, murder in the first degree, may be found from a
defendant\'s words or conduct or from the attendant circumstances
together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, and may be inferred
from the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body
of another human being.

If we consider only the evidence which is favorable to the Commonwealth,
it is without the slightest doubt sufficient in law to prove first
degree. However, even if we believe all of defendant\'s statements and
testimony, there is no doubt that this killing constituted murder in the
first degree. Defendant first urges that there was insufficient time for
premeditation in the light of his good reputation. This is based on an
isolated and oft repeated statement in *Commonwealth v. Drum*, 58 Pa. 9,
16, that \" \'no time is too short for a wicked man to frame in his mind
his scheme of murder.\' \" Defendant argues that, conversely, a long
time is necessary to find premeditation in a \"good man.\" We find no
merit in defendant\'s analogy or contention. As Chief Justice MAXEY
appropriately and correctly said in *Commonwealth v. Earnest*, 342 Pa.
544, 21 A.2d 38 (pages 549-550): \"Whether the intention to kill and the
killing, that is, the premeditation and the fatal act, were within a
brief space of time or a long space of time is immaterial if the killing
was in fact intentional, willful, deliberate and premeditated. . . . As
Justice AGNEW said in *Com. v. Drum*: \'The law fixes upon no length of
time as necessary to form the intention to kill, but leaves the
existence of a fully formed intent as a fact to be determined by the
jury, from all the facts and circumstances in the evidence.\' \"

Defendant further contends that the time and place of the crime, the
enormous difficulty of removing and concealing the body, and the obvious
lack of an escape plan, militate against and make a finding of
premeditation legally impossible. This is a \"jury argument\"; it is
clear as crystal that such circumstances do not negate premeditation.
This contention of defendant is likewise clearly devoid of merit.

Defendant\'s most earnestly pressed contention is that the
psychiatrist\'s opinion of what defendant\'s state of mind must have
been and was at the time of the crime, clearly establishes not only the
lack but also the legal impossibility of premeditation. Dr. Davis, a
psychiatrist of the Allegheny County Behavior Clinic, testified that
defendant was

. . . for a number of years . . . passively going along with a situation
which he . . . \[was\] not controlling and he . . . \[was\] not making
any decisions, and finally a decision . . . \[was\] forced on him . . .
. He had left the military to take this assignment, and he was averaging
about nine thousand a year; he had a good job. He knew that if he
didn\'t accept this teaching assignment in all probability he would be
dismissed from the Government service, and at his age and his special
training he didn\'t know whether he would be able to find employment.
More critical to that was the fact that at this point, as we understand
it, his wife issued an ultimatum that if he went and gave this training
course she would leave him . . . . He was so dependent upon her he
didn\'t want her to leave. He couldn\'t make up his mind what to do. He
was trapped. . .

The doctor then gave his opinion that \"rage\", \"desperation\", and
\"panic\" produced

an impulsive automatic reflex type of homicide, . . . as opposed to an
intentional premeditated type of homicide. . . . Our feeling was that if
this gun had fallen to the floor he wouldn\'t have been able to pick it
up and consummate that homicide. And I think if he had to load the gun
he wouldn\'t have done it. This is a matter of opinion, but this is our
opinion about it.

There are three answers to this contention. First, as we have
hereinbefore stated, neither a Judge nor a jury has to believe all or
any part of the testimony of the defendant or of any witness. Secondly,
the opinion of the psychiatrists was based to a large extent upon
statements made to them by the defendant, which need not be believed and
which are in some instances opposed by the facts themselves. Thirdly, a
psychiatrist\'s opinion of a defendant\'s impulse or lack of intent or
state of mind is, in this class of case, entitled to very little weight,
and this is especially so when defendant\'s own actions, or his
testimony or confession, or the facts themselves, belie the opinion.

Defendant\'s own statement after his arrest, upon which his counsel so
strongly relies, as well as his testimony at his trial, clearly convict
him of first degree murder and justify the finding and sentence of the
Court below. Defendant himself described his actions at the time he
killed his wife. From his own statements and from his own testimony, it
is clear that, terribly provoked by his allegedly nagging, belligerent
and sadistic wife, defendant remembered the gun, deliberately took it
down, and deliberately fired two shots into the head of his sleeping
wife. There is no doubt that this was a wilful, deliberate, and
premeditated murder.

While this picture of his wife is different from that depicted by her
neighbors, if defendant\'s version is true, the remedy lies in a
commutation by the Board of Pardons and not by a disregard of the law by
the Courts.

While defendant makes no contention that he was insane at the commission
of the murder or at any time, what this Court said in *Commonwealth v.
Tyrrell*, 405 Pa. is equally appropriate here:

Defendant\'s psychiatrist did not testify that the defendant was insane.
What he did say was that because defendant\'s wife frequently picked on
him and just before the killing insulted or goaded him, defendant had an
emotional impulse to kill her which he could not resist.

. . . society would be almost completely unprotected from criminals if
the law permitted a blind or irresistible impulse or inability to
control one\'s self, to excuse or justify a murder or to reduce it from
first degree to second degree. In the times in which we are living
nearly every normal adult human being has moments or hours or days or
longer periods when he or she is depressed and disturbed with resultant
emotional upset feelings and so-called blind impulses; and the young
especially have many uncontrolled emotions every day which are
euphemistically called irresistible impulses. The Courts of Justice
should not abdicate their function and duty of determining criminal
responsibility to the psychiatrist. In such event, the test will differ
not only with each psychiatrist but also with the prevailing psychiatric
winds of the moment.

Just as the Courts cannot abdicate to the psychiatrists the task of
determining criminal responsibility in law, so also they cannot remit to
psychiatrists the right to determine the intent or the state of mind of
an accused at the time of the commission of a homicide.

Judgment and sentence affirmed.

State v. Guthrie

 

### *State v. Guthrie*

Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia

461 S.E.2d 163 (W. Vir. 1995)

 

CLECKLEY, Justice:

The defendant, Dale Edward Guthrie, appeals the January, 1994, jury
verdict of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County finding him guilty of
first degree murder. In May of 1994, the defendant was sentenced to
serve a life sentence with a recommendation of mercy.

It is undisputed that on the evening of February 12, 1993, the defendant
removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed his co-worker, Steven Todd
Farley, in the neck and killed him. The two men worked together as
dishwashers at Danny\'s Rib House in Nitro and got along well together
before this incident. On the night of the killing, the victim, his
brother, Tracy Farley, and James Gibson were joking around while working
in the kitchen of the restaurant. The victim was poking fun at the
defendant who appeared to be in a bad mood. He told the defendant to
\"lighten up\" and snapped him with a dishtowel several times.
Apparently, the victim had no idea he was upsetting the defendant very
much. The dishtowel flipped the defendant on the nose and he became
enraged.

The defendant removed his gloves and started toward the victim. Mr.
Farley, still teasing, said: \"Ooo, he\'s taking his gloves off.\" The
defendant then pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the victim in
the neck. He also stabbed Mr. Farley in the arm as he fell to the floor.
Mr. Farley looked up and cried: \"Man, I was just kidding around.\" The
defendant responded: \"Well, man, you should have never hit me in my
face.\"

It is also undisputed that the defendant suffers from a host of
psychiatric problems. He experiences up to two panic attacks daily and
had received treatment for them at the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Huntington for more than a year preceding the killing. He suffers
from chronic depression (dysthymic disorder), an obsession with his nose
(body dysmorphic disorder), and borderline personality disorder. The
defendant\'s father shed some light on his nose fixation. He stated that
dozens of times a day the defendant stared in the mirror and turned his
head back and forth to look at his nose. His father estimated that 50
percent of the time he observed his son he was looking at his nose. The
defendant repeatedly asked for assurances that his nose was not too big.
This obsession began when he was approximately seventeen years old. The
defendant was twenty-nine years old at the time of trial.

The defendant testified he suffered a panic attack immediately preceding
the stabbing. He described the attack as \"intense\"; he felt a lot of
pressure and his heart beat rapidly. In contrast to the boisterous
atmosphere in the kitchen that evening, the defendant was quiet and kept
to himself. He stated that Mr. Farley kept irritating him that night.
The defendant could not understand why Mr. Farley was picking on him
because he had never done that before. Even at trial, the defendant did
not comprehend his utter overreaction to the situation. In hindsight,
the defendant believed the better decision would have been to punch out
on his time card and quit over the incident. However, all the witnesses
related that the defendant was in no way attacked, as he perceived it,
but that Mr. Farley was playing around. The defendant could not bring
himself to tell the other workers to leave him alone or inform them
about his panic attacks.

The principal question before us under this assignment of error is
whether our instructions on murder when given together deprive a
criminal defendant of due process or are otherwise wrong and confusing.

State\'s Instruction No. 8 stated:

\"The Court instructs the jury that to constitute a willful, deliberate
and premeditated killing, it is not necessary that the intention to kill
should exist for any particular length of time prior to the actual
killing; it is only necessary that such intention should have come into
existence for the first time at the time of such killing, or at any time
previously.\"

The linchpin of the problems that flow from these instructions is the
failure adequately to inform the jury of the difference between first
and second degree murder. Of particular concern is the lack of guidance
to the jury as to what constitutes premeditation and the manner in which
the instructions infuse premeditation with the intent to kill.

While many jurisdictions do not favor the distinction between first and
second degree murder, given the doctrine of separation of powers, we do
not have the judicial prerogative to abolish the distinction between
first and second degree murder and rewrite the law of homicide for West
Virginia; unless, of course, we were to declare this classification a
violation of due process and force the Legislature to rewrite the
law---a bold stroke that we refuse to do. On the other hand, we believe
within the parameters of our current homicide statutes the definition of
premeditation and deliberation is confusing, if not meaningless. To
allow the State to prove premeditation and deliberation by only showing
that the intention came \"into existence for the first time at the time
of such killing\" completely eliminates the distinction between the two
degrees of murder. Hence, we feel compelled in this case to attempt to
make the dichotomy meaningful by making some modifications to our
homicide common law.

Premeditation and deliberation should be defined in a more careful, but
still general way to give juries both guidance and reasonable
discretion. Although premeditation and deliberation are not measured by
any particular period of time, there must be some period between the
formation of the intent to kill and the actual killing, which indicates
the killing is by prior calculation and design. As suggested by the
dissenting opinion in *Green v. State,* 1 Tenn.Crim.App. 719, 735
(1970): \"True, it is not necessary to prove premeditation existed for
any definite period of time. But it is necessary to prove that it did
exist.\" This means there must be an opportunity for some reflection on
the intention to kill after it is formed. The accused must kill
purposely after contemplating the intent to kill. Although an elaborate
plan or scheme to take life is not required, our notion of instantaneous
premeditation and momentary deliberation is not satisfactory for proof
of first degree murder. In *Bullock v. United States,* 74 App.D.C. 220,
221 (1941), the court discussed the need to have some appreciable time
elapse between the intent to kill and the killing:

\"To speak of premeditation and deliberation which are instantaneous, or
which take no appreciable time, is a contradiction in terms. It deprives
the statutory requirement of all meaning and destroys the statutory
distinction between first and second degree murder. At common law there
were no degrees of murder. If the accused had no overwhelming
provocation to kill, he was equally guilty whether he carried out his
murderous intent at once or after mature reflection. Statutes like ours,
which distinguish deliberate and premeditated murder from other murder,
reflect a belief that one who meditates an intent to kill and then
deliberately executes it is more dangerous, more culpable or less
capable of reformation than one who kills on sudden impulse; or that the
prospect of the death penalty is more likely to deter men from
deliberate than from impulsive murder. The deliberate killer is guilty
of first degree murder; the impulsive killer is not. The quoted part of
the charge was therefore erroneous.\"

Thus, there must be some evidence that the defendant considered and
weighed his decision to kill in order for the State to establish
premeditation and deliberation under our first degree murder statute.
This is what is meant by a ruthless, cold-blooded, calculating killing.
Any other intentional killing, by its spontaneous and nonreflective
nature, is second degree murder.

\[W\]e agree with the defendant that the language in \[State\'s
Instruction Number 8\] virtually eliminates the distinction in this
State between first and second degree murder, equating as it does
premeditation with the formation of the intent to kill.\
\
\[The court then approved an alternative instruction that stated that
\"The time in which to form a deliberate and premeditated design varies
as the minds and temperaments of people differ, and according to the
circumstances in which they may be placed. Any interval of time between
the forming of the intent to kill and the execution of that intent,
which is of sufficient duration for the accused to be fully conscious of
what he intended, is sufficient to support a conviction for first degree
murder.\" \--sk\]

Note: People v. Anderson

 

TW: Sexual Assault

 

### Note on *People v. Anderson*, 447 P.2d 942 (Cal. 1968)

The horrific facts of the case were as follows:\[1\]

When the police arrived at 7 p.m. the shades were down on all the
windows and the doors were locked. Defendant finally opened the front
door for one of the officers who arrested and handcuffed defendant. The
arresting officer testified that defendant was wearing slacks, no shirt
or shoes, and that there was no blood on him.

The arresting officer found Victoria\'s body on the floor near her bed.
He found defendant\'s blood-spotted shorts on a chair in the living
room, and a knife and defendant\'s socks, with blood encrusted on the
soles, in the master bedroom. The evidence established that the
victim\'s torn and bloodstained dress had been ripped from her, that her
clothes, including her panties out of which the crotch had been ripped,
were found in various rooms of the house, that there were bloody
footprints matching the size of the victim\'s leading from the master
bedroom to Victoria\'s room, and that there was blood in almost every
room including the kitchen, the floor of which appeared to have been
mopped.

The TV cameraman who covered the murder story for channel 11, the
officer who drove defendant to the police station, and the officer who
\"observed\" defendant for four hours at the station the night of
December 7, 1962, all testified that defendant did not appear
intoxicated. The officers who talked to defendant testified, however,
that they smelled alcohol on his breath; a blood test taken at 7:45 p.m.
indicated that the alcohol content in defendant\'s blood was .34
percent, which was more than necessary for an automobile driver to be
classified as \"under the influence.\"

Over 60 wounds, both severe and superficial, were found on Victoria\'s
body. The cuts extended over her entire body. Several of the wounds ...
were post mortem.

Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.
He argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to
support a first degree murder conviction and the State Supreme Court
agreed.

Given the presumption that an unjustified killing of a human being
constitutes murder of the second, rather than of the first, degree, and
the clear legislative intention to differentiate between first and
second degree murder, we must determine in any case of circumstantial
evidence whether the proof is such as will furnish a reasonable
foundation for an inference of premeditation and deliberation, or
whether it \"leaves only to conjecture and surmise the conclusion that
defendant either arrived at or carried out the intention to kill as the
result of a concurrence of deliberation and premeditation.\"

Thus we have held that in order for a killing with malice aforethought
to be first rather than second degree murder, \"\'\[t\]he intent to kill
must be \... formed upon a pre-existing reflection,\' \... \[and have\]
been the subject of actual deliberation or forethought \....\" We have
therefore held that \"\[a\] verdict of murder in the first degree \...
\[on a theory of a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing\] is
proper only if the slayer killed \'as a result of careful thought and
weighing of considerations; as a deliberate judgment or plan; carried on
cooly and steadily, \[especially\] according to a preconceived design.\'

The type of evidence which this court has found sufficient to sustain a
finding of premeditation and deliberation falls into three basic
categories: (1) facts about how and what defendant did prior to the
actual killing which show that the defendant was engaged in activity
directed toward, and explicable as intended to result in, the
killing\--what may be characterized as \"planning\" activity; (2) facts
about the defendant\'s prior relationship and/or conduct with the victim
from which the jury could reasonably infer a \"motive\" to kill the
victim, which inference of motive, together with facts of type (1) or
(3), would in turn support an inference that the killing was the result
of \"a pre-existing reflection\" and \"careful thought and weighing of
considerations\" rather than \"mere unconsidered or rash impulse hastily
executed\"; (3) facts about the nature of the killing from which the
jury could infer that the manner of killing was so particular and
exacting that the defendant must have intentionally killed according to
a \"preconceived design\" to take his victim\'s life in a particular way
for a \"reason\" which the jury can reasonably infer from facts of type
(1) or (2).

Applying this standard to the facts of Anderson, the Court was unable to
find sufficient facts from which a jury could conclude that Anderson
premeditated the killing. The Court concluded that the brutal and
senseless nature of the killing showed an absence of the kinds of facts

3.2.1.5

Official Comment to Section 210.6

 

Withdrawn in 2009, Section 210.6 of the MPC provided those circumstances
under which the death penalty was appropriate. In the commentary to that
section, the authors discuss why the code rejected the traditional line
between first and second degree murder.

 

### Official Comment to MPC § 210.6

Prior reflection may reveal the uncertainties of a tortured conscience
rather than exceptional depravity. The very fact of a long internal
struggle may be evidence that the homicidal impulse was deeply
aberrational and far more the product of extraordinary circumstances
than a true reflection of the actor's normal character Thus, for
example, one suspects that most mercy killings are the consequence of
long and careful deliberation, but they are not especially appropriate
cases for imposition of capital punishment.

It also seems clear, moreover, that some purely impulsive murders will
present no extenuating circumstance. The suddenness of the killing may
simply reveal callousness so complete and depravity so extreme that no
hesitation is required.

 

 

 

3.2.2

Murder v. Voluntary Manslaughter

 

Voluntary manslaughter is a common law concept whereby an intentional
killing is reduced from murder to manslaughter because the killing
occured after an adequate provocation and before a suffienct cooling
time had passed. The traditional approach to provocation is set forth in
the more modern case, Girourard: only certain provocative acts would
suffice to reduce an intentional killing from murder to manslaughter. By
contrast, the modern approach is set forth in the older case, Maher:
Juries should decide whether a reasonable person in the defendant\'s
position would have been provoked under the circumstances. As we read
these cases and the MPC approach, consider whether voluntary
manslaughter is a sensible concept and, if so, how it should be
delimited.

Girouard v. State

 

### *Girouard v. State*

Court of Appeals of Maryland

538 A.2d 718 (Md. App. 1991)

 

COLE, Judge.

In this case we are asked to reconsider whether the types of provocation
sufficient to mitigate the crime of manslaughter should be limited to
the categories we have heretofore recognized, or whether the sufficiency
of the provocation should be decided by the factfinder on a case-by-case
basis. Specifically, we must determine whether words alone are
provocation adequate to justify a conviction of manslaughter rather than
one of second degree murder.

The Petitioner, Steven S. Girouard, and the deceased, Joyce M. Girouard,
had been married for about two months on October 28, 1987, the night of
Joyce\'s death. Both parties, who met while working in the same
building, were in the army. They married after having known each other
for approximately three months. The evidence at trial indicated that the
marriage was often tense and strained, and there was some evidence that
after marrying Steven, Joyce had resumed a relationship with her old
boyfriend, Wayne.

On the night of Joyce\'s death, Steven overheard her talking on the
telephone to her friend, whereupon she told the friend that she had
asked her first sergeant for a hardship discharge because her husband
did not love her anymore. Steven went into the living room where Joyce
was on the phone and asked her what she meant by her comments; she
responded, \"nothing.\" Angered by her lack of response, Steven kicked
away the plate of food Joyce had in front of her. He then went to lie
down in the bedroom.

Joyce followed him into the bedroom, stepped up onto the bed and onto
Steven\'s back, pulled his hair and said, \"What are you going to do,
hit me?\" She continued to taunt him by saying, \"I never did want to
marry you and you are a lousy fuck and you remind me of my dad.\" The
barrage of insults continued with her telling Steven that she wanted a
divorce, that the marriage had been a mistake and that she had never
wanted to marry him. She also told him she had seen his commanding
officer and filed charges against him for abuse. She then asked Steven,
\"What are you going to do?" Receiving no response, she continued her
attack. She added that she had filed charges against him in the Judge
Advocate General\'s Office (JAG) and that he would probably be court
martialed.

When she was through, Steven asked her if she had really done all those
things, and she responded in the affirmative. He left the bedroom with
his pillow in his arms and proceeded to the kitchen where he procured a
long-handled kitchen knife. He returned to Joyce in the bedroom with the
knife behind the pillow. He testified that he was enraged and that he
kept waiting for Joyce to say she was kidding, but Joyce continued
talking. She said she had learned a lot from the marriage and that it
had been a mistake. She also told him she would remain in their
apartment after he moved out. When he questioned how she would afford
it, she told him she would claim her brain-damaged sister as a dependent
and have the sister move in. Joyce reiterated that the marriage was a
mistake, that she did not love him and that the divorce would be better
for her.

After pausing for a moment, Joyce asked what Steven was going to do.
What he did was lunge at her with the kitchen knife he had hidden behind
the pillow and stab her 19 times. Realizing what he had done, he dropped
the knife and went to the bathroom to shower off Joyce\'s blood. 
Feeling like he wanted to die, Steven went back to the kitchen and found
two steak knives with which he slit his own wrists. He lay down on the
bed waiting to die, but when he realized that he would not die from his
self-inflicted wounds, he got up and called the police, telling the
dispatcher that he had just murdered his wife.

When the police arrived they found Steven wandering around outside his
apartment building. Steven was despondent and tearful and seemed
detached, according to police officers who had been at the scene. He was
unconcerned about his own wounds, talking only about how he loved his
wife and how he could not believe what he had done. Joyce Girouard was
pronounced dead at the scene.

At trial, defense witness, psychologist, Dr. William Stejskal, testified
that Steven was out of touch with his own capacity to experience anger
or express hostility. He stated that the events of October 28, 1987,
were entirely consistent with Steven\'s personality, that Steven had
"basically reach\[ed\] the limit of his ability to swallow his anger, to
rationalize his wife\'s behavior, to tolerate, or actually to remain in
a passive mode with that. He essentially went over the limit of his
ability to bottle up those emotions. What ensued was a very extreme
explosion of rage that was intermingled with a great deal of panic."
Another defense witness, psychiatrist, Thomas Goldman, testified that
Joyce had a "compulsive need to provoke jealousy so that she\'s always
asking for love and at the same time destroying and undermining any
chance that she really might have to establish any kind of mature love
with anybody."

Steven Girouard was convicted, at a court trial in the Circuit Court for
Montgomery County, of second degree murder and was sentenced to 22 years
incarceration, 10 of which were suspended. Upon his release, Petitioner
is to be on probation for five years, two years supervised and three
years unsupervised. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment
of the circuit court in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari to
determine whether the circumstances of the case presented provocation
adequate to mitigate the second degree murder charge to manslaughter.

Petitioner relies primarily on out of state cases to provide support for
his argument that the provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter
should not be limited only to the traditional circumstances of extreme
assault or battery upon the defendant; mutual combat; defendant\'s
illegal arrest; injury or serious abuse of a close relative of the
defendant's or the sudden discovery of a spouse\'s adultery. Petitioner
argues that manslaughter is a catchall for homicides which are criminal
but that lack the malice essential for a conviction of murder. Steven
argues that the trial judge did find provocation (although he held it
inadequate to mitigate murder) and that the categories of provocation
adequate to mitigate should be broadened to include factual situations
such as this one.

The State counters by stating that although there is no list of legally
adequate provocations, the common law developed to a point at which it
may be said there are some concededly provocative acts that society is
not prepared to recognize as reasonable. Words spoken by the victim, no
matter how abusive or taunting, fall into a category society should not
accept as adequate provocation.

According to the State, if abusive words alone could mitigate murder to
manslaughter, nearly every domestic argument ending in the death of one
party could be mitigated to manslaughter. This, the State avers, is not
an acceptable outcome. Thus, the State argues that the courts below were
correct in holding that the taunting words by Joyce Girouard were not
provocation adequate to reduce Steven's second degree murder charge to
voluntary manslaughter.

Initially, we note that the difference between murder and manslaughter
is the presence or absence of malice. Voluntary manslaughter has been
defined as \"an *intentional* homicide, done in a sudden heat of
passion, caused by adequate provocation, before there has been a
reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool" (emphasis in original).

There are certain facts that may mitigate what would normally be murder
to manslaughter. For example, we have recognized as falling into that
group: (1) discovering one\'s spouse in the act of sexual intercourse
with another; (2) mutual combat; (3) assault and battery. There is also
authority recognizing injury to one of the defendant\'s relatives or to
a third party, and death resulting from resistance of an illegal arrest
as adequate provocation for mitigation to manslaughter. Those acts
mitigate homicide to manslaughter because they create passion in the
defendant and are not considered the product of free will.

In order to determine whether murder should be mitigated to manslaughter
we look to the circumstances surrounding the homicide and try to
discover if it was provoked by the victim. Over the facts of the case we
lay the template of the so-called "Rule of Provocation." The courts of
this State have repeatedly set forth the requirements of the Rule of
Provocation:

1\. There must have been adequate provocation;\
2. The killing must have been in the heat of passion;\
3. It must have been a sudden heat of passion---that is, the killing
must have followed the provocation before there had been a reasonable
opportunity for the passion to cool;\
4. There must have been causal connection between the provocation, the
passion, and the fatal act.

We shall assume without deciding that the second, third, and fourth of
the criteria listed above were met in this case. We focus our attention
on an examination of the ultimate issue in this case, that is, whether
the provocation of Steven by Joyce was enough in the eyes of the law so
that the murder charge against Steven should have been mitigated to
voluntary manslaughter. For provocation to be \"adequate,\" it must be
"\'calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to
cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason.'" The
issue we must resolve, then, is whether the taunting words by Joyce were
enough to inflame the passion of a reasonable man so that that man would
be sufficiently infuriated so as to strike out in hot-blooded blind
passion to kill her.  Although we agree with the trial judge that there
was needless provocation by Joyce, we also agree with him that the
provocation was not adequate to mitigate second degree murder to
voluntary manslaughter.

Although there are few Maryland cases discussing the issue at bar, those
that do hold that words alone are not adequate provocation. Most
recently, in *Sims v. State*, 319 Md. 540, 573 A.2d 1317, we held that
\"\[i\]nsulting words or gestures, no matter how opprobrious, do not
amount to an affray and standing alone, do not constitute adequate
provocation." That case involved the flinging of racial slurs and
derogatory comments by the victim at the defendant. That conduct did not
constitute adequate provocation.

In *Lang v. State,* 6 Md.App. 128 (1969), the Court of Special Appeals
stated that it is "generally held that mere words, threats, menaces or
gestures, however offensive and insulting, do not constitute adequate
provocation.\" Before the shooting, the victim had called the appellant
\"a chump\" and "a chicken,\" dared the appellant to fight, shouted
obscenities at him and shook his fist at him. *Id.* The provocation,
again, was not enough to mitigate murder.

The court, in *Lang,* did note, however, that words can constitute
adequate provocation if they are accompanied by conduct indicating a
present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm.
Clearly, no such conduct was exhibited by Joyce in this case. While
Joyce did step on Steven\'s back and pull his hair, he could not
reasonably have feared bodily harm at her hands. This, to us, is certain
based on Steven\'s testimony at trial that Joyce was about 5\'1\" tall
and weighed 115 pounds, while he is 6'2" tall, weighing over 200 pounds.
Joyce simply did not have the size or strength to cause Steven to fear
for his bodily safety. Thus, since there was no ability on the part of
Joyce to cause Steven harm, the words she hurled at him could not, under
the analysis in *Lang,* constitute legally sufficient provocation.

Thus, with no reservation, we hold that the provocation in this case was
not enough to cause a reasonable man to stab his provoker 19 times.
Although a psychologist testified to Steven\'s mental problems and his
need for acceptance and love, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals
speaking through Judge Moylan that \"there must be not simply
provocation in psychological fact, but one of certain fairly
well-defined classes of provocation recognized as being adequate as a
matter of law.\" The standard is one of reasonableness; it does not and
should not focus on the peculiar frailties of mind of the Petitioner.
That standard of reasonableness has not been met here. We cannot in good
conscience countenance holding that a verbal domestic argument ending in
the death of one spouse can result in a conviction of manslaughter. We
agree with the trial judge that social necessity dictates our holding.
Domestic arguments easily escalate into furious fights. We perceive no
reason for a holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a
domestic dispute is by killing the spouse.

Maher v. People

 

### *Maher v. People*

Michigan Supreme Court

10 Mich. 212 (1862)

 

CHRISTIANCY, J.

The prisoner was charged with an assault with intent to kill and murder
one Patrick Hunt. The evidence on the part of the prosecution was, that
the prisoner entered the saloon of one Michael Foley, in the village of
Houghton, where said Hunt was standing with several other persons; that
prisoner entered through a back door and by a back way leading to it, in
his shirt sleeves, in a state of great perspiration, and appearing to be
excited; that as soon as the prisoner came up to where Hunt was
standing, he fired a pistol at Hunt, the charge of which took effect
upon the head of Hunt, in and through the left ear, causing a severe
wound thereon; by reason of which Hunt in a few moments fell to the
floor, was partially deprived of his sense of hearing in that ear, and
received a severe shock to his system which caused him to be confined to
his bed for about a week. The prisoner offered evidence tending to show
an adulterous intercourse between his wife and Hunt on the morning of
the assault, and within less than half an hour previous; that the
prisoner saw them going into the woods together about half an hour
before the assault; that on their coming out of the woods the prisoner
followed them immediately (evidence having already been given that
prisoner had followed them to the woods); that, on their coming out of
the woods, the prisoner followed them and went after said Hunt into the
saloon, where, on his arrival, the assault was committed; that the
prisoner on his way to the saloon, a few minutes before entering it, was
met by a friend who informed him that Hunt and the prisoner\'s wife had
had sexual intercourse the day before in the woods- This evidence was
rejected by the Court, and the prisoner excepted. Was the evidence
properly rejected? This is the main question in the case, and its
decision must depend upon the question whether the proposed evidence
would have tended to reduce the killing---had death ensued---from murder
to manslaughter? If the homicide---in case death had ensued --- would
have been but manslaughter, then defendant could not be guilty of the
assault with intent to murder, but only of a simple assault and battery.
The question therefore involves essentially the same principles as where
evidence is offered for a similar purpose in a prosecution for murder;
except that, in some cases of murder, an actual intention to kill need
not exist; but in a prosecution for an assault with intent to murder,
the actual intention to kill must be found, and that under circumstances
which would make the killing murder.

To give the homicide the legal character of murder, all the authorities
agree that it must have been perpetrated with malice prepense or
aforethought. This malice is just as essential an ingredient of the
offense as the act which causes the death. It is sufficient to say that,
within the principle of all the recognized definitions, the homicide
must, in all ordinary cases, have been committed with some degree of
coolness and deliberation, or, at least, under circumstances in which
ordinary men, or the average of men recognized as peaceable citizens,
would not be liable to have their reason clouded or obscured by passion;
and the act must be prompted by, or the circumstances indicate that it
sprung from, a wicked, depraved or malignant mind .

But if the act of killing, though intentional, be committed under the
influence of passion or in heat of blood, produced by an adequate or
reasonable provocation, and before a reasonable time has elapsed for the
blood to cool and reason to resume its habitual control, and is the
result of the temporary excitement, by which the control of reason was
disturbed, rather than of any wickedness of heart or cruelty or
recklessness of disposition; then the law, out of indulgence to the
frailty of human nature, or rather, in recognition of the laws upon
which human nature is constituted, very properly regards the offense as
of a less heinous character than murder, and gives it the designation of
manslaughter.

To what extent the passions must be aroused and the dominion of reason
disturbed to reduce the offense from murder to manslaughter, the cases
are by no means agreed; and any rule which should embrace all the cases
that have been decided in reference to this point, would come very near
obliterating, if it did not entirely obliterate, all distinction between
murder and manslaughter in such cases. \"We must therefore endeavor to
discover the principle upon which the question is to be determined. It
\"will not do to hold that reason should be entirely dethroned, or
overpowered by passion so as to destroy intelligent volition." Such a
degree of mental disturbance would be equivalent to utter insanity, and,
if the result of adequate provocation, would render the perpetrator
morally innocent. But the law regards manslaughter as a high grade of
offense; as a felony. On principle, therefore, the extent to which the
passions are required to be aroused and reason obscured must be
considerably short of this, and never beyond that degree within which
ordinary men have the power, and are therefore morally as well as
legally bound, to restrain their passions. It is only on the idea of a
violation of this clear duty, that the act can be held criminal.

The principle involved in the question, and which, I think, clearly
deducible from the majority of well considered cases, would seem to
suggest as the true general rule, that reason should, at the time of the
act, be disturbed or obscured by passion to an extent which might render
ordinary men, of fair average disposition, liable to act rashly or
without due deliberation or reflection, and from passion, rather than
judgment. To the question, what shall be considered in law a reasonable
or adequate provocation for such a state of mind, so as to give to a
homicide, committed under its influence, the character of manslaughter;
on principle, the answer, as a general rule, must be, anything the
natural tendency of which would be to produce such a state of mind in
ordinary men, and which the jury are satisfied did produce it in the
case before them---not such a provocation as must, by the laws of the
human mind, produce such an effect with the certainty that physical
effects follow from physical causes; for then the individual could
hardly be held morally accountable. Nor, on the other hand, must the
provocation, in every case, be held sufficient or reasonable, because
such a state of excitement has followed from it; for then, by habitual
and long continued indulgence of evil passions, a bad man might acquire
a claim to mitigation which would not be available to better men, and on
account of that very wickedness of heart which, in itself, constitutes
an aggravation both in morals and in law.

In determining whether the provocation is sufficient or reasonable,
ordinary human nature, or the average of men recognized as men of fair
average mind and disposition, should be taken as the standard---unless,
indeed, the person whose guilt is in question be shown to have some
peculiar weakness of mind or infirmity of temper, not arising from
wickedness of heart or cruelty of disposition. It is doubtless, in one
sense, the province of the Court to define what, in law, will constitute
a reasonable or adequate provocation, but not, I think, in ordinary
cases, to determine whether the provocation proved in the particular
case is sufficient or reasonable. This is essentially a question of
fact, and to be decided with reference to the peculiar facts of each
particular case. As a general rule, the Court, after informing the jury
to what extent the passions must be aroused and reason obscured to
render the homicide manslaughter, should inform them that the
provocation must be one, the tendency of which would be to produce such
a degree of excitement and disturbance in the minds of ordinary men; and
if they should find such provocation from the facts proved, and should
further find that it did produce that effect in the particular instance,
and that the homicide was the result of such provocation, it would give
it the character of manslaughter. Besides the consideration that the
question is essentially one of fact, jurors, from the mode of their
selection, coming from the various classes and occupations of society,
and conversant with the practical affairs of life, are, in my opinion,
much better qualified to judge of the sufficiency and tendency of a
given provocation, and much more likely to fix, with some degree of
accuracy the standard of what constitutes the average of ordinary human
nature, than the Judge whose habits and course of life give him much
less experience of the workings of passion in the actual conflicts of
life.

The Judge, it is true, must, to some extent, assume to decide upon the
sufficiency of the alleged provocation, when the question arises upon
the admission of testimony; and when it is so clear as to admit of no
reasonable doubt upon any theory, that the alleged provocation could not
have had any tendency to produce such state of mind, in ordinary men,
lie may properly exclude the evidence; but, if the alleged provocation
be such as to admit of any reasonable doubt, whether it might not have
had such tendency, it is much safer, I think, and more in accordance
with principle, to let the evidence go to the jury under the proper
instructions.

The same principles which govern, as to the extent to which the passions
must be excited and reason disturbed, apply with equal force to the time
during which its continuance may be recognized as a ground for
mitigating the homicide to the degree of manslaughter, or, in other
words, to the question of cooling time. This, like the provocation
itself, must depend upon the nature of man and the laws of the human
mind, as well as upon the nature and circumstances of the provocation,
the extent to which the passions have been aroused, and the fact,
whether the injury inflicted by the provocation is more or less
permanent or irreparable. The passion excited by a blow received in a
sudden quarrel, though perhaps equally violent for the moment, would be
likely much sooner to subside than if aroused by a rape committed upon a
sister or a daughter, or the discovery of an adulterous intercourse with
a wife; and no two cases of the latter kind would be likely to be
identical in all their circumstances of provocation. No precise time,
therefore, in hours or minutes, can be laid down by the Court, as a rule
of law, within which the passions must be held to have subsided and
reason to have resumed its control, without setting at defiance the laws
of man\'s nature, and ignoring the very principle on which provocation
and passion are allowed to be shown, at all, in mitigation of the
offense. it is a question of fact for the jury; and the Court cannot
take it from the jury by assuming to decide it as a question of law,
without confounding the respective provinces of the Court and jury: this
question of reasonable cooling time was expressly held to be a question
of fact for the jury.

It remains only to apply these principles to the present case. The
proposed evidence, in connection with what had already been given, would
have tended strongly to show the commission of adultery by Hunt with the
prisoner\'s wife, within half an hour before the assault; that the
prisoner saw them going to the woods together, under circumstances
calculated strongly to impress upon his mind the belief of the
adulterous purpose; that he followed after them to the woods; that Hunt
and the prisoner\'s wife were, not long after, seen coming from the
woods, and that the prisoner followed them, and went in hot pursuit
after Hunt to the saloon, and was informed by a friend on the way that
they had committed adultery the day before in the woods. I can not
resist the conviction that this would have been sufficient evidence of
provocation to go to the jury, and from which, when taken in connection
with the excitement and \"great perspiration\" exhibited on entering the
saloon, the hasty manner in which he approached and fired the pistol at
Hunt, it would have been competent for the jury to find that the act was
committed in consequence of the passion excited by the provocation, and
in a state of mind which, within the principle already explained, would
have given to the homicide, had death ensued, the character of
manslaughter only.

 

MARTIN C. J. and CAMPBELL J. concurred.

J. MANNING

I differ from my brethren in this case. I think the evidence was
properly excluded. To make that manslaughter which would otherwise be
murder, the provocation---I am not speaking of its sufficiency, but of
the provocation itself--- must be given in the presence of the person
committing the homicide. The cause of the provocation must occur in his
presence. More especially since the abolition of the death penalty for
murder, and the division of the crime into murder in the first and
second degree. There is not now the same reason, namely, the severity of
the punishment, for relaxing the rules of law in favor of a party
committing homicide as before. It would, it seems to me, be extremely
mischievous to let passion engendered by suspicion, or by something one
has heard, enter into and determine the nature of a crime committed
while under its influence. The innocent as well as the guilty, or those
who had not as well as those who had given provocation, might be the
sufferers. If it be said that in such cases the giving of the
provocation must be proved or it would go for nothing; the answer is,
that the law will not, and should not permit the lives of the innocent
to be exposed with the guilty in this way, as it would do did it not
require the cause of the provocation to occur in the presence of the
person committing the homicide.

I think the judgment should be affirmed.

 

 

 

3.2.2.3

Comment to Section 210.3

 

### Comment to Section 210.3

This formulation effects substantial changes in the traditional notion
of provocation. For one thing, it does not require that the actor's
emotional distress arise from some injury, affront, or other provocative
act perpetrated upon him by the deceased. Under the Code, mitigation may
be appropriate where the actor believes that the deceased is responsible
for some injustice to another or even where he strikes out in a blinding
rage and kills an innocent bystander.

Section 210.3 also sweeps away the rigid rules that limited provocation
to certain defined circumstances. Instead it casts the issue in phrases
that have no common-law antecedents and hence no accumulated doctrinal
content... This development reflects the trend of many modern decisions
to abandon preconceived notions of what constitutes adequate provocation
and to submit that question to the jury's deliberation.

The critical element in the Model Code formulation is the clause
requiring that reasonable be assessed "from the viewpoint of a person in
the actor's situation." The word "situation" is designedly ambiguous. On
the one hand, it is clear that personal handicaps and some external
circumstances must be taken into account. Thus, blindness, shock from
traumatic injury, and extreme grief are all easily read into the term
"situation" This result is sound, for it would be morally obtuse to
appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment without reference to these
factors. On the other hand, it is equally plain that idiosyncratic moral
values are not part of the actor's situation. An assassin who kills a
political leader because he believes it is right to do so cannot ask
that he be judged by the standard of a reasonable extremist. Any other
result would undermine the normative message of the criminal law. In
between these two extremes, however, there are matters neither as
clearly distinct from individual blameworthiness as blindness or
handicap nor as integral a part of moral depravity as a belief in the
rightness of killing.

TW: Intimate partner violence

 

### *People v. Casassa*

Court of Appeals of New York

404 NE.2d 1310 (NY App. 1980)

 

JASEN, Judge.

On February 28, 1977, Victoria Lo Consolo was brutally murdered.
Defendant Victor Casassa and Miss Lo Consolo had been acquainted for
some time prior to the latter\'s tragic death. They met in August, 1976
as a result of their residence in the same apartment complex. Shortly
thereafter, defendant asked Miss Lo Consolo to accompany him to a social
function and she agreed. The two apparently dated casually on other
occasions until November, 1976 when Miss Lo Consolo informed defendant
that she was not \"falling in love\" with him. Defendant claims that
Miss Lo Consolo\'s candid statement of her feelings \"devastated him.\"

Miss Lo Consolo\'s rejection of defendant\'s advances also precipitated
a bizarre series of actions on the part of defendant. Defendant, aware
that Miss Lo Consolo maintained social relationships with others, broke
into the apartment below Miss Lo Consolo\'s on several occasions to
eavesdrop. These eavesdropping sessions allegedly caused him to be under
great emotional stress. Thereafter, on one occasion, he broke into Miss
Lo Consolo\'s apartment while she was out. Defendant took nothing, but,
instead, observed the apartment, disrobed, and lay for a time in Miss Lo
Consolo\'s bed. During this break-in, defendant was armed with a knife
which, he later told police, he carried \"because he knew that he was
either going to hurt Victoria or Victoria was going to cause him to
commit suicide.\"

Defendant\'s final visit to his victim\'s apartment occurred on February
28, 1977. Defendant brought several bottles of wine and liquor with him
to offer as a gift. Upon Miss Lo Consolo\'s rejection of this offering,
defendant produced a steak knife which he had brought with him, stabbed
Miss Lo Consolo several times in the throat, dragged her body to the
bathroom and submerged it in a bathtub full of water to \"make sure she
was dead.\"

The defendant did not contest the underlying facts of the crime.
Instead, the sole issue presented to the trial court was whether the
defendant, at the time of the killing, had acted under the influence of
\"extreme emotional disturbance\". (Penal Law, § 125.25(1)(a).) The
defense presented only one witness, a psychiatrist, who testified, in
essence, that the defendant had become obsessed with Miss Lo Consolo and
that the course which their relationship had taken, combined with
several personality attributes peculiar to defendant, caused him to be
under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the
killing.

In rebuttal, the People produced several witnesses. Among these
witnesses was a psychiatrist who testified that although the defendant
was emotionally disturbed, he was not under the influence of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\" within the meaning of § 125.25(1)(a) of the
Penal Law because his disturbed state was not the product of external
factors but rather was \"a stress he created from within himself,
dealing mostly with a fantasy, a refusal to accept the reality of the
situation.\"

The trial court in resolving this issue noted that extreme emotional
disturbance may be based upon a series of events, rather than a single
precipitating cause. In order to be entitled to the defense, the court
held, a defendant must show that his reaction to such events was
reasonable. In determining whether defendant\'s emotional reaction was
reasonable, the court considered the appropriate test to be whether in
the totality of the circumstances the finder of fact could understand
how a person might have his reason overcome. Concluding that the test
was not to be applied solely from the viewpoint of defendant, the court
found that defendant\'s emotional reaction at the time of the commission
of the crime was so peculiar to him that it could not be considered
reasonable so as to reduce the conviction to manslaughter in the first
degree. Accordingly, the trial court found defendant guilty of the crime
of murder in the second degree. The Appellate Division affirmed, without
opinion.

On this appeal defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing
to afford him the benefit of the affirmative defense of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\". It is argued that the defendant established
that he suffered from a mental infirmity not arising to the level of
insanity which disoriented his reason to the extent that his emotional
reaction, from his own subjective point of view, was supported by a
reasonable explanation or excuse. Defendant asserts that by refusing to
apply a wholly subjective standard the trial court misconstrued section
125.25(1)(a) of the Penal Law. We cannot agree.

Section 125.25(1)(a) of the Penal Law provides that it is an affirmative
defense to the crime of murder in the second degree where \"\[t\]he
defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for
which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.\" This defense
allows a defendant charged with the commission of acts which would
otherwise constitute murder to demonstrate the existence of mitigating
factors which indicate that, although he is not free from responsibility
for his crime, he ought to be punished less severely by reducing the
crime upon conviction to manslaughter in the first degree.

In enacting section 125.25(1)(a) of the Penal Law, the Legislature
adopted the language of the manslaughter provisions of the Model Penal
Code (see § 201.3(1)(b)). The Model Penal Code formulation, however, as
enacted by the Legislature, represented a significant departure from the
prior law of this State.

The \"extreme emotional disturbance\" defense is an outgrowth of the
\"heat of passion\" doctrine which had for some time been recognized by
New York as a distinguishing factor between the crimes of manslaughter
and murder.

For example, the \"heat of passion\" doctrine required that a
defendant\'s action be undertaken as a response to some provocation
which prevented him from reflecting upon his actions. Moreover, such
reaction had to be immediate. The existence of a \"cooling off\" period
completely negated any mitigating effect which the provocation might
otherwise have had.

The thrust of defendant\'s claim, however, concerns a question arising
out of another perceived distinction between \"heat of passion\" and
\"extreme emotional disturbance,\" to wit: whether, assuming that the
defense is applicable to a broader range of circumstances, the standard
by which the reasonableness of defendant\'s emotional reaction is to be
tested must be an entirely subjective one.

Section 125.25(1)(a) of the Penal Law states it is an affirmative
defense to the crime of murder that \"\[t\]he defendant acted under the
influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a
reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be
determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\'s situation
under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\" Whether
the language of this statute requires a completely subjective evaluation
of reasonableness is a question that has never been decided by this
court, although it has been raised in our lower courts with diverse
results.

Consideration of the Comments to the Model Penal Code, from which the
New York statute was drawn, are instructive. Model Penal Code, § 201.3,
Comment (Tent Draft No. 9 (1959)). The defense of \"extreme emotional
disturbance\" has two principal components (1) the particular defendant
must have \"acted under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance\", and (2) there must have been \"a reasonable explanation
or excuse\" for such extreme emotional disturbance, \"the reasonableness
of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the
defendant\'s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed
them to be\". The first requirement is wholly subjective i. e., it
involves a determination that the particular defendant did in fact act
under extreme emotional disturbance, that the claimed explanation as to
the cause of his action is not contrived or sham.

The second component is more difficult to describe i.e., whether there
was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance. It
was designed to sweep away \"the rigid rules that have developed with
respect to the sufficiency of particular types of provocation, such as
the rule that words alone can never be enough\" *(Id.,* at pp. 46-47),
and \"avoids a merely arbitrary limitation on the nature of the
antecedent circumstances that may justify a mitigation\" (*Id.*). \"The
ultimate test, however, is objective; there must be \'reasonable\'
explanation or excuse for the actor\'s disturbance\" (*Id.*, at p. 41).
In light of these comments and the necessity of articulating the defense
in terms comprehensible to jurors, we conclude that the determination
whether there was reasonable explanation or excuse for a particular
emotional disturbance should be made by viewing the subjective, internal
situation in which the defendant found himself and the external
circumstances as he perceived them at the time, however inaccurate that
perception may have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the
explanation or excuse for his emotional disturbance was reasonable, so
as to entitle him to a reduction of the crime charged from murder in the
second degree to manslaughter in the first degree.\[2\] We recognize
that even such a description of the defense provides no precise
guidelines and necessarily leaves room for the exercise of judgmental
evaluation by the jury. This, however, appears to have been the intent
of the draftsmen. \"The purpose was explicitly to give full scope to
what amounts to a plea in mitigation based upon a mental or emotional
trauma of significant dimensions, with the jury asked to show whatever
empathy it can.\" (Wechsler, *Codification of Criminal Law in the United
States: The Model Penal Code*, 68 Col.L.Rev. 1425, 1446.)

By suggesting a standard of evaluation which contains both subjective
and objective elements, we believe that the drafters of the code
adequately achieved their dual goals of broadening the \"heat of
passion\" doctrine to apply to a wider range of circumstances while
retaining some element of objectivity in the process. The result of
their draftsmanship is a statute which offers the defendant a fair
opportunity to seek mitigation without requiring that the trier of fact
find mitigation in each case where an emotional disturbance is shown or
as the drafters put it, to offer \"room for argument as to the
reasonableness of the explanations or excuses offered.\"

We note also that this interpretation comports with what has long been
recognized as the underlying purpose of any mitigation statute. In the
words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, referring to an earlier statute: \"What we
have is merely a privilege offered to the jury to find the lesser degree
when the suddenness of the intent, the vehemence of the passion, seems
to call irresistibly for the exercise of mercy. I have no objection to
giving them this dispensing power, but it should be given to them
directly and not in a mystifying cloud of words.\" (Cardozo, Law and
Literature, pp. 100-101.) In the end, we believe that what the
Legislature intended in enacting the statute was to allow the finder of
fact the discretionary power to mitigate the penalty when presented with
a situation which, under the circumstances, appears to them to have
caused an understandable weakness in one of their fellows. Perhaps the
chief virtue of the statute is that it allows such discretion without
engaging in a detailed explanation of individual circumstances in which
the statute would apply, thus avoiding the \"mystifying cloud of words\"
which Mr. Justice Cardozo abhorred.

We conclude that the trial court, in this case, properly applied the
statute. The court apparently accepted, as a factual matter, that
defendant killed Miss Lo Consolo while under the influence of \"extreme
emotional disturbance\", a threshold question which must be answered in
the affirmative before any test of reasonableness is required. The
court, however, also recognized that in exercising its function as trier
of fact, it must make a further inquiry into the reasonableness of that
disturbance. In this regard, the court considered each of the mitigating
factors put forward by defendant, including his claimed mental
disability, but found that the excuse offered by defendant was so
peculiar to him that it was unworthy of mitigation. The court obviously
made a sincere effort to understand defendant\'s \"situation\" and \"the
circumstances as defendant believed them to be\", but concluded that the
murder in this case was the result of defendant\'s malevolence rather
than an understandable human response deserving of mercy. We cannot say,
as a matter of law, that the court erred in so concluding.

defendant\'s emotional disturbance, and not the act of killing, was
supported by a reasonable explanation or excuse.

Unintentional Homicide

 

Unlike in the previous section, all of these killings involve defendants
who did not mean to cause death. They may have acted negligently,
recklessly, or, in the case of felony murder, wholly without mens rea
with regard to death. We will study the various ways the common law and
MPC distinguish among these killings.

In these cases, we look at accidental killings that straddle the line
between crime and tort. Remember our discussion that we had early in the
semester about what makes criminal law different from tort and contract.
Are the defendants in these cases deserving of the law\'s condemnation
and punishment?

### *Commonwealth v. Welansky*

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

55 N.E.2d 902 (Mass. 1942) 

 

LUMMUS, J.

\[The defendant was charged with multiple counts of homicide for his
involvement in the Cocoanut Grove fire, an infamous nightclub disaster
that claimed the lives of nearly 500 people in Boston.\]

On November 28, 1942, and for about nine years before that day, a
corporation named New Cocoanut Grove, Inc., maintained and operated a
\"night club\" in Boston, for the furnishing to the public for
compensation of food, drink, and entertainment consisting of orchestra
and band music, singing and dancing. It employed about eighty persons.

The defendant was accustomed to spend his evenings at the night club,
inspecting the premises and superintending the business. On November 16,
1942, he became suddenly ill, and was carried to a hospital, where he
was in bed for three weeks and remained until discharged on December 11,
1942. During his stay at the hospital, although employees visited him
there, he did not concern himself with the night club, because, as he
testified, he \"knew it would be all right\" and that \"the same system
. . . \[he\] had would continue\" during his absence. There is no
evidence of any act, omission or condition at the night club on November
28, 1942, (apart from the lighting of a match hereinafter described),
that was not within the usual and regular practice during the time
before the defendant was taken ill when he was at the night club nearly
every evening.

We now come to the story of the fire. A little after ten o\'clock on the
evening of Saturday, November 28, 1942, the night club was well filled
with a crowd of patrons. It was during the busiest season of the year.
An important football game in the afternoon had attracted many visitors
to Boston. Upon the evidence it could have been found that at that time
there were from two hundred fifty to four hundred persons in the Melody
Lounge, from four hundred to five hundred in the main dining room and
the Caricature Bar, and two hundred fifty in the Cocktail Lounge. Yet it
could have been found that the crowd was no larger than it had been on
other Saturday evenings before the defendant was taken ill, and that
there had been larger crowds at earlier times.

A bartender in the Melody Lounge noticed that an electric light bulb
which was in or near the cocoanut husks of an artificial palm tree in
the corner had been turned off and that the corner was dark. He directed
a sixteen year old bar boy who was waiting on customers at the tables to
cause the bulb to be lighted. A soldier sitting with other persons near
the light told the bar boy to leave it unlighted. But the bar boy got a
stool, lighted a match in order to see the bulb, turned the bulb in its
socket, and thus lighted it. The bar boy blew the match out, and started
to walk away. Apparently the flame of the match had ignited the palm
tree and that had speedily ignited the low cloth ceiling near it, for
both flamed up almost instantly. The fire spread with great rapidity
across the upper part of the room, causing much heat. The crowd in the
Melody Lounge rushed up the stairs, but the fire preceded them. People
got on fire while on the stairway. The fire spread with great speed
across the foyer and into the Caricature Bar and the main dining room,
and thence into the Cocktail Lounge. Soon after the fire started the
lights in the night club went out. The smoke had a peculiar odor. The
crowd were panic stricken, and rushed and pushed in every direction
through the night club, screaming, and overturning tables and chairs in
their attempts to escape.

The door at the head of the Melody Lounge stairway was not opened until
firemen broke it down from outside with an axe and found it locked by a
key lock, so that the panic bar could not operate. Two dead bodies were
found close to it, and a pile of bodies about seven feet from it. The
door in the vestibule of the office did not become open, and was barred
by the clothing rack. The revolving door soon jammed, but was burst out
by the pressure of the crowd. The head waiter and another waiter tried
to get open the panic doors from the main dining room to Shawmut Street,
and succeeded after some difficulty. The other two doors to Shawmut
Street were locked, and were opened by force from outside by firemen and
others. Some patrons escaped through them, but many dead bodies were
piled up inside them. A considerable number of patrons escaped through
the Broadway door, but many died just inside that door. Some employees,
and a great number of patrons, died in the fire. Others were taken out
of the building with fatal burns and injuries from smoke, and died
within a few days.

## I. The pleadings, verdicts, and judgments.

The alleged misconduct of the defendant consisted in causing or
permitting or failing reasonably to prevent defective wiring, the
installation of inflammable decorations, the absence of fire doors, the
absence of \"proper means of egress properly maintained\" and
\"sufficient proper\" exits, and overcrowding.

## II. The principles governing liability.

The Commonwealth disclaimed any contention that the defendant
intentionally killed or injured the persons named in the indictments as
victims. It based its case on involuntary manslaughter through wanton or
reckless conduct. The judge instructed the jury correctly with respect
to the nature of such conduct.

Usually wanton or reckless conduct consists of an affirmative act, like
driving an automobile or discharging a firearm, in disregard of probable
harmful consequences to another. But where, as in the present case,
there is a duty of care for the safety of business visitors invited to
premises which the defendant controls, wanton or reckless conduct may
consist of intentional failure to take such care in disregard of the
probable harmful consequences to them or of their right to care. To
define wanton or reckless conduct so as to distinguish it clearly from
negligence and gross negligence is not easy. Sometimes the word
\"wilful\" is prefaced to the words \"wanton\" and \"reckless\" in
expressing the concept. That only blurs it. Wilful means intentional. In
the phrase \"wilful, wanton or reckless conduct,\" if \"wilful\"
modifies \"conduct\" it introduces something different from wanton or
reckless conduct, even though the legal result is the same. Wilfully
causing harm is a wrong, but a different wrong from wantonly or
recklessly causing harm. If \"wilful\" modifies \"wanton or reckless
conduct\" its use is accurate. What must be intended is the conduct, not
the resulting harm. The words \"wanton\" and \"reckless\" are
practically synonymous in this connection, although the word \"wanton\"
may contain a suggestion of arrogance or insolence or heartlessness that
is lacking in the word \"reckless.\" But intentional conduct to which
either word applies is followed by the same legal consequences as though
both words applied.

The standard of wanton or reckless conduct is at once subjective and
objective, as has been recognized ever since *Commonwealth v. Pierce*,
138 Mass. 165. Knowing facts that would cause a reasonable man to know
the danger is equivalent to knowing the danger. The judge charged the
jury correctly when he said,

\"To constitute wanton or reckless conduct, as distinguished from mere
negligence, grave danger to others must have been apparent, and the
defendant must have chosen to run the risk rather than alter his conduct
so as to avoid the act or omission which caused the harm. If the grave
danger was in fact realized by the defendant, his subsequent voluntary
act or omission which caused the harm amounts to wanton or reckless
conduct, no matter whether the ordinary man would have realized the
gravity of the danger or not. But even if a particular defendant is so
stupid \[or\] so heedless . . . that in fact he did not realize the
grave danger, he cannot escape the imputation of wanton or reckless
conduct in his dangerous act or omission, if an ordinary normal man
under the same circumstances would have realized the gravity of the
danger. A man may be reckless within the meaning of the law although he
himself thought he was careful.\"

The essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way
either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which
conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will
result to another. Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to what has been
variously described as indifference to or disregard of probable
consequences to that other.

The words \"wanton\" and \"reckless\" are thus not merely rhetorical or
vituperative expressions used instead of negligent or grossly negligent.
They express a difference in the degree of risk and in the voluntary
taking of risk so marked, as compared with negligence, as to amount
substantially and in the eyes of the law to a difference in kind. For
many years this court has been careful to preserve the distinction
between negligence and gross negligence, on the one hand, and wanton or
reckless conduct on the other. In pleadings as well as in statutes the
rule is that \"negligence and wilful and wanton conduct are so different
in kind that words properly descriptive of the one commonly exclude the
other.\"

Notwithstanding language used commonly in earlier cases, and
occasionally in later ones, it is now clear in this Commonwealth that at
common law conduct does not become criminal until it passes the borders
of negligence and gross negligence and enters into the domain of wanton
or reckless conduct. There is in Massachusetts at common law no such
thing as \"criminal negligence.\"

Wanton or reckless conduct is the legal equivalent of intentional
conduct. If by wanton or reckless conduct bodily injury is caused to
another, the person guilty of such conduct is guilty of assault and
battery. To convict the defendant of manslaughter, the Commonwealth was
not required to prove that he caused the fire by some wanton or reckless
conduct. Fire in a place of public resort is an ever present danger. It
was enough to prove that death resulted from his wanton or reckless
disregard of the safety of patrons in the event of fire from any cause.

Judgments affirmed.

TW: Child Death\
\
This case mentions in passing native parents\' fear that their child
would be taken from them if they brought him to a hospital. This was not
an idle fear. The Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in 1978, in part
to address the history of native children being removed from their homes
and placed in white homes in order to assimilate them. See this

### *State v. Williams*

Court of Appeals of Washington

484 P.2d 1167 (1971)

 

HOROWITZ, Chief Judge.

Defendants, husband and wife, were charged by information filed October
3, 1968, with the crime of manslaughter for negligently failing to
supply their 17-month child with necessary medical attention, as a
result of which he died on September 12, 1968. Upon entry of findings,
conclusions and judgment of guilty, sentences were imposed on April 22,
1969. Defendants appeal.

The defendant husband, Walter Williams, is a 24-year old full-blooded
Sheshont Indian with a sixth-grade education. His sole occupation is
that of laborer. The defendant wife, Bernice Williams, is a 20-year-old
part Indian with an 11th grade education. At the time of the marriage,
the wife had two children, the younger of whom was a 14-month son. Both
parents worked and the children were cared for by the 85-year-old mother
of the defendant husband. The defendant husband assumed parental
responsibility with the defendant wife to provide clothing, care and
medical attention for the child. Both defendants possessed a great deal
of love and affection for the defendant wife\'s young son.

The court expressly found:

That both defendants were aware that William Joseph Tabafunda was ill
during the period September 1, 1968 to September 12, 1968. The
defendants were ignorant. They did not realize how sick the baby was.
They thought that the baby had a toothache and no layman regards a
toothache as dangerous to life. They loved the baby and gave it aspirin
in hopes of improving its condition. They did not take the baby to a
doctor because of fear that the Welfare Department would take the baby
away from them. They knew that medical help was available because of
previous experience. They had no excuse that the law will recognize for
not taking the baby to a doctor.

The defendants Walter L. Williams and Bernice J. Williams were negligent
in not seeking medical attention for William Joseph Tabafunda.

That as a proximate result of this negligence, William Joseph Tabafunda
died.

From these and other findings, the court concluded that the defendants
were each guilty of the crime of manslaughter as charged.

Parental duty to provide medical care for a dependent minor child was
recognized at common law and characterized as a natural duty. Under
\[Washington\] statutes the crime is deemed committed even though the
death of the victim is the proximate result of only simple or ordinary
negligence. The concept of simple or ordinary negligence describes a
failure to exercise the \'ordinary caution\' necessary to make out the
defense of excusable homicide. Ordinary caution is the kind of caution
that a man of reasonable prudence would exercise under the same or
similar conditions. If, therefore, the conduct of a defendant,
regardless of his ignorance, good intentions and good faith, fails to
measure up to the conduct required of a man of reasonable prudence, he
is guilty of ordinary negligence because of his failure to use
\'ordinary caution.\' If such negligence proximately causes the death of
the victim, the defendant, as pointed out above, is guilty of statutory
manslaughter.

Because of the serious nature of the charge against the parent and
step-parent of a well-loved child, and out of our concern for the
protection of the constitutional rights of the defendants, we have made
an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether it
substantially supports the court\'s express finding on proximate cause
and its implied finding that the duty to furnish medical care became
activated in time to prevent death of the child.

Dr. Gale Wilson, the autopsy surgeon and chief pathologist for the King
County Coroner, testified that the child died because an abscessed tooth
had been allowed to develop into an infection of the mouth and cheeks,
eventually becoming gangrenous. This condition, accompanied by the
child\'s inability to eat, brought about malnutrition, lowering the
child\'s resistance and eventually producing pneumonia, causing the
death. Dr. Wilson testified that in his opinion the infection had lasted
for approximately 2 weeks, and that the odor generally associated with
gangrene would have been present for approximately 10 days before death.
He also expressed the opinion that had medical care been first obtained
in the last week before the baby\'s death, such care would have been
obtained too late to have saved the baby\'s life. Accordingly, the
baby\'s apparent condition between September 1 and September 5, 1968
became the critical period for the purpose of determining whether in the
exercise of ordinary caution defendants should have provided medical
care for the minor child.

The testimony concerning the child\'s apparent condition during the
critical period is not crystal clear, but is sufficient to warrant the
following statement of the matter. The defendant husband testified that
he noticed the baby was sick about 2 weeks before the baby died. The
defendant wife testified that she noticed the baby was ill about a week
and a half or 2 weeks before the baby died. The evidence showed that in
the critical period the baby was fussy; that he could not keep his food
down; and that a cheek started swelling up. The swelling went up and
down, but did not disappear. In that same period, the cheek turned \'a
bluish color like.\' The defendants, not realizing that the baby was as
ill as it was or that the baby was in danger of dying, attempted to
provide some relief to the baby by giving the baby aspirin during the
critical period and continued to do so until the night before the baby
died. The defendants thought the swelling would go down and were waiting
for it to do so; and defendant husband testified, that from what he had
heard, neither doctors nor dentists pull out a tooth \'when it\'s all
swollen up like that.\' There was an additional explanation for not
calling a doctor given by each defendant. Defendant husband testified
that \'the way the cheek looked, . . . and that stuff on his hair, they
would think we were neglecting him and take him away from us and not
give him back.\' Defendant wife testified that the defendants were
\'waiting for the swelling to go down,\' and also that they were afraid
to take the child to a doctor for fear that the doctor would report them
to the welfare department, who, in turn, would take the child away.
\'It\'s just that I was so scared of losing him.\' They testified that
they had heard that the defendant husband\'s cousin lost a child that
way. The evidence showed that the defendants did not understand the
significance or seriousness of the baby\'s symptoms. However, there is
no evidence that the defendants were physically or financially unable to
obtain a doctor, or that they did not know an available doctor, or that
the symptoms did not continue to be a matter of concern during the
critical period. Indeed, the evidence shows that in April 1968 defendant
husband had taken the child to a doctor for medical attention.

In our opinion, there is sufficient evidence from which the court could
find, as it necessarily did, that applying the standard of ordinary
caution, I.e., the caution exercisable by a man of reasonable prudence
under the same or similar conditions, defendants were sufficiently put
on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby\'s illness and lack of
improvement in the baby\'s apparent condition in the period from
September 1 to September 5, 1968, to have required them to have obtained
medical care for the child. The failure so to do in this case is
ordinary or simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to
support a conviction of statutory manslaughter.

The judgment is affirmed.

UTTER and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.

 

 

 

3.3.2

Unintentional Murder

 

Recall the statutes that opened this section. Many described murder as a
killing done with malice aforethought. We\'ve already seen that intent
to kill is one way that malice aforethought can be satisfied. In this
section, we examine other mental states that will also suffice. We will
see that some accidental killings may also qualify as murder if the
defendant\'s recklessness was so extreme that it is akin to intentional
killing.

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

47 A.2d 445 (Penn. 1946)

 

MAXEY, Chief Justice.

This is an appeal from the judgment and sentence under a conviction of
murder in the second degree. William H. Long, age 13 years, was killed
by a shot from a 32-caliber revolver held against his right side by the
defendant, then aged 17 years. These youths were on friendly terms at
the time of the homicide. The defendant and his mother while his father
and brother were in the U. S. Armed Forces, were residing in Lancaster,
Pa., with the family of William H. Long, whose son was the victim of the
shooting.

On the evening of February 26th, 1945, when the defendant went to a
moving picture theater, he carried in the pocket of his raincoat a
revolver which he had obtained at the home of his uncle on the preceding
day. In the afternoon preceding the shooting, the decedent procured a
cartridge from his father\'s room and he and the defendant placed it in
the revolver.

After leaving the theater, the defendant went to a dairy store and there
met the decedent. Both youths sat in the rear of the store ten minutes,
during which period the defendant took the gun out of his pocket and
loaded the chamber to the right of the firing pin and then closed the
gun. A few minutes later, both youths sat on stools in front of the
lunch counter and ate some food. The defendant suggested to the decedent
that they play 'Russian Poker.' ^1^ Long replied; 'I don\'t care; go
ahead.'

The defendant then placed the revolver against the right side of Long
and pulled the trigger three times. The third pull resulted in a fatal
wound to Long. The latter jumped off the stool and cried: 'Oh! Oh! Oh!'
and Malone said: 'Did I hit you, Billy? Gee, Kid, I\'m sorry.' Long died
from the wounds two days later.

The defendant testified that the gun chamber he loaded was the first one
to the right of the firing chamber and that when he pulled the trigger
he did not 'expect to have the gun go off.' He declared he had no
intention of harming Long, who was his friend and companion. The
defendant was indicted for murder, tried and found guilty of murder in
the second degree and sentenced to a term in the penitentiary for a
period not less than five years and not exceeding ten years. A new trial
was refused and after sentence was imposed, an appeal was taken.

At common law, the 'grand criterion' which 'distinguished murder from
other killing' was malice on the part of the killer and this malice was
not necessarily 'malevolent to the deceased particularly' but 'any evil
design in general; the dictate of a wicked, depraved and malignant
heart'; 4 Blackstone 199. Among the examples that Blackstone cites of
murder is 'coolly discharging a gun among a multitude of people,'
causing the death of someone of the multitude.

In Pennsylvania, the common law crime of murder is divided into two
degrees, and murder of the second degree includes every element which
enters into first degree murder except the intention to kill: When an
individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he must
reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result, he
exhibits that 'wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty,
recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty'
which proved that there was at that time in him 'the state or frame of
mind termed malice.\' This court has declared that if a driver
'wantonly, recklessly, and in disregard of consequences\' hurls 'his car
against another, or into a crowd' and death results from that act 'he
ought . . . to face the same consequences that would be meted out to him
if he had accomplished death by wantonly and wickedly firing a gun.'
 'Malice in law means a depraved and wicked heart that is reckless and
disregards the rights of others. Reckless conduct that results in the
death of another is malice. To illustrate that: If a man fires a gun
into a crowd and kills another it is murder, because the fact of the
reckless shooting of a gun into a crowd is malice in law. That wicked
and depraved disposition and that recklessness and disregard of human
life is malice.'

'When a man uses a gun loaded with powder and shot and aimed at a vital
part of the body of another and discharges it, he must be presumed to
know that death is likely to follow.' In *Com. v. Arnold*, 292 Pa. 210,
at page 213, this court said: 'Malice will be implied from conduct,
recklessness of consequences, or the cruelty of the crime.'

Trial judges should make it clear to the jury that an unlawful killing
in order to constitute murder must result from an intentional, felonious
act and not merely from an inadvertent or negligent act.

The killing of William H. Long by this defendant resulted from an act
intentionally done by the latter, in reckless and wanton disregard of
the consequences which were at least sixty percent certain from his
thrice attempted discharge of a gun known to contain one bullet and
aimed at a vital part of Long\'s body. This killing was, therefore,
murder, for malice in the sense of a wicked disposition is evidenced by
the intentional doing of an uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its
likely harmful effects on others. The fact that there was no motive for
this homicide does not exculpate the accused. In a trial for murder
proof of motive is always relevant but never necessary.

^1^It has been explained that 'Russian Poker' is a game in which the
participants, in turn, place a single cartridge in one of the five
chambers of a revolver cylinder, give the latter a quick twirl, place
the muzzle of the gun against the temple and pull the trigger, leaving
it to chance whether or not death results to the trigger puller.

United States v. Fleming

 

### *United States v. Fleming*

United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit

739 F.2d 945 (4^th^ Cir. 1984)

 

HARRISON L. WINTER, Chief Judge:

This case requires us to decide whether a non-purposeful vehicular
homicide can ever amount to murder. We conclude that it can.

I.

Defendant David Earl Fleming was convicted of second-degree murder, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1111 in the death of Margaret Jacobsen Haley.
Mrs. Haley was the driver of an automobile with which an automobile
operated by the defendant collided when defendant lost control while
traveling at a high rate of speed.

Fleming\'s car was observed at about 3:00 p.m. on June 15, 1983,
traveling southbound on the George Washington Memorial Parkway in
northern Virginia at speeds variously estimated by witnesses as between
70 and 100 miles per hour. The speed limit on the Parkway is, at most
points, 45 miles per hour. Fleming several times directed his southbound
car into the northbound lanes of the Parkway in order to avoid traffic
congestion in the southbound lanes. Northbound traffic had to move out
of his way in order to avoid a head-on collision. At one point, a
pursuing police officer observed Fleming steer his car into the
northbound lanes, which were separated from the southbound lanes at that
point and for a distance of three-tenths of a mile by a raised concrete
median, and drive in the northbound lanes, still at a high rate of
speed, for the entire length of the median. At two other points, Fleming
traveled in northbound lanes that were separated from the southbound
lanes by medians.

Approximately six miles from where his car was first observed traveling
at excessive speed, Fleming lost control of it on a sharp curve. The car
slid across the northbound lanes, striking the curb on the opposite side
of the highway. After striking the curb, Fleming\'s car straightened out
and at that moment struck the car driven by Mrs. Haley that was coming
in the opposite direction. Fleming\'s car at the moment of impact was
estimated by witnesses to have been traveling 70 to 80 miles per hour;
the speed limit at that point on the Parkway was 30 miles per hour. Mrs.
Haley received multiple severe injuries and died before she could be
extricated from her car.

Fleming was pulled from the wreckage of his car and transported to a
Washington hospital for treatment. His blood alcohol level was there
tested at .315.

Fleming was indicted by a grand jury on a charge of second-degree murder
and a number of other charges which are not relevant to this appeal. He
was tried before a jury on the murder charge and convicted.

II\.

Defendant maintains that the facts of the case cannot support a verdict
of murder. Particularly, defendant contends that the facts are
inadequate to establish the existence of malice aforethought, and thus
that he should have been convicted of manslaughter at most.

Malice aforethought, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a), is the
distinguishing characteristic which, when present, makes a homicide
murder rather than manslaughter. Whether malice is present or absent
must be inferred by the jury from the whole facts and circumstances
surrounding the killing.

Proof of the existence of malice does not require a showing that the
accused harbored hatred or ill will against the victim or others.
Neither does it require proof of an intent to kill or injure. Malice may
be established by evidence of conduct which is "reckless and wanton and
a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care, of such a nature
that a jury is warranted in inferring that defendant was aware of a
serious risk of death or serious bodily harm." To support a conviction
for murder, the government need only have proved that defendant intended
to operate his car in the manner in which he did with a heart that was
without regard for the life and safety of others.

We conclude that the evidence regarding defendant\'s conduct was
adequate to sustain a finding by the jury that defendant acted with
malice aforethought. It is urged upon us, however, that a verdict of
murder in this case should be precluded by the existence of a statute
defining and proscribing involuntary manslaughter, 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a).
Defendant maintains that vehicular homicide where no purpose on the part
of the accused to have caused death or injury has been shown should
result only in conviction of involuntary manslaughter. Otherwise,
defendant argues, all drunk driving homicides and many reckless driving
ones will be prosecutable as murder. We are not persuaded by the
argument.

The difference between malice, which will support conviction for murder,
and gross negligence, which will permit of conviction only for
manslaughter, is one of degree rather than kind. In the vast majority of
vehicular homicides, the accused has not exhibited such wanton and
reckless disregard for human life as to indicate the presence of malice
on his part. In the present case, however, the facts show a deviation
from established standards of regard for life and the safety of others
that is markedly different in degree from that found in most vehicular
homicides. In the average drunk driving homicide, there is no proof that
the driver has acted while intoxicated with the purpose of wantonly and
intentionally putting the lives of others in danger. Rather, his driving
abilities were so impaired that he recklessly put others in danger
simply by being on the road and attempting to do the things that any
driver would do. In the present case, however, danger did not arise only
by defendant\'s determining to drive while drunk. Rather, in addition to
being intoxicated while driving, defendant drove in a manner that could
be taken to indicate depraved disregard of human life, particularly in
light of the fact that because he was drunk his reckless behavior was
all the more dangerous.

AFFIRMED.

 

 

 

3.3.2.3

Note based on People v. Watson

 

### Note based on *People v. Watson*, 637 P.2d 279 (Ca. 1981)

In *Watson*, the defendant was charged with second degree murder after
driving between 70 and 80 in a 35 MPH zone, ultimately killing the
driver and six-year-old passenger of another car. Thirty minutes after
the incident defendant's BAC was .23 percent. The California Supreme
Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to charge Watson with
reckless homicide: "Defendant had consumed enough alcohol to raise his
blood alcohol content to a level which would support a finding that he
was legally intoxicated. He had driven his car to the establishment
where he had been drinking, and he must have known that he would have to
drive it later. It also may be presumed that defendant was aware of the
hazards of driving while intoxicated."

In dissent, Chief Justice Bird disagreed:

The fact that respondent was under the influence of alcohol made his
driving more dangerous. A high percentage of accidents is caused by such
drivers. No one holds a brief for this type of activity. However, a rule
should not be promulgated by this court that driving while under the
influence of alcohol is sufficient to establish an act "likely to kill."
Death or injury is not the probable result of driving while under the
influence of alcohol. "Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of
Californians each week reach home without accident despite their driving
intoxicated."

The majority also fail to demonstrate that it is reasonable to infer
that respondent had a conscious disregard for life. Can a conscious
disregard for life be established by the fact that several hours before
the accident respondent drove his car to a bar? The majority hold as a
matter of law that he "must have known" he would have to drive his car
later and that he wilfully drank alcohol until he was under its
influence.

How does respondent\'s state of mind at the time he drove to the bar and
began drinking justify an inference that he had a reckless state of mind
at the time of the accident? This meager evidence does not justify the
inference that by drinking alcohol he harbored a conscious disregard for
life when he later drove his car! I submit that the majority\'s
reasoning that such an inference may be drawn to support a finding of
implied malice will be used to establish second degree murder in every
case in which a person drives a car to a bar, a friend\'s home, or a
party, drinks alcohol so that he is under its influence, drives away and
is involved in a fatal accident.

Who do you think has the better argument here?

 

 

 

3.3.2.4

Excerpt of People v. Jefferson

 

The Colorado Penal Code has an unusual quirk: A defendant may be
convicted of first degree murder \-- punishable by a life term without
parole \-- based on either intent to kill or universal malice, though if
he kills knowingly, he may be convicted only of second-degree murder
which is punishable by a term of years rather than a life term.\
\
In this case the defendant argues that this distinction is irrational
and that an accidental killing such as the one with which he was charged
should result in no more than a second-degree murder conviction.

 

### Excerpt of *People v. Jefferson*

Supreme Court of Colorado

748 P.2d 1223 (Colo. 1988)

 

\[Defendants were charged with first degree murder under a theory of
universal malice and challenged the statute as depriving them of equal
protection; they argued that there was no rational basis for treating
some accidental killings as first degree murder while knowing,
unpremeditated killings are treated as second degree murder.\]

Section 18--3--102(1)(d) provides that a person commits the crime of
murder in the first degree if:

Under circumstances evidencing an attitude of universal malice
manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life generally,
he knowingly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to a
person, or persons, other than himself, and thereby causes the death of
another.

By comparison, section 18--3--103(1)(a) provides that a person commits
the crime of murder in the second degree if "\[h\]e causes the death of
a person knowingly, but not after deliberation." If these two crimes
cannot be sufficiently distinguished so that a person of average
intelligence could understand the difference between them, then the
defendant who engages in identical conduct proscribed by both statutes
but is sentenced under the harsher penalty accompanying a conviction for
first-degree murder, would be denied the equal protection of the laws.
We now turn to an analysis of the extreme indifference murder statute to
determine if it proscribes conduct different from that proscribed by the
state\'s second-degree murder statute.

At common law, murder was defined as the unlawful killing of another
human being with "malice aforethought." There were no degrees of murder
at common law; instead, malice was the essential ingredient
distinguishing murder from other types of criminal homicide. Over time,
the phrase malice aforethought became an arbitrary symbol used by common
law judges to signify any of a number of mental states deemed sufficient
to support liability for murder. Among the categories was what became
known as "depraved-heart murder." This label derived from decisions and
statutes condemning as murder unintentional homicide under circumstances
evincing a "depraved mind" or an "abandoned and malignant heart."

Malice aforethought could be either express or implied. Malice included
more than simply an intent to kill or endanger human life. Malice could
also be found where the killer directed no animosity, enmity, or ill
will toward the victim. In describing the kind of malice which would
support a conviction for murder at common law, a number of commentators
seized upon the following definition:

Malice is not restricted to hatred, spite, or malevolence toward the
particular person slain, but also includes that general malignity and
reckless disregard of human life proceeding from a heart void of a just
sense of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.

1 Warren on Homicide § 66 at 271

The essential concept was one of extreme recklessness regarding
homicidal risk. Thus, a person might be liable for murder absent any
actual intent to kill or injure if he caused the death of another in a
manner exhibiting "a wanton and willful disregard of an unreasonable
human risk," or, in the confusing elaboration of one court "a wickedness
of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of
consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty." Since "depraved
heart" murderers exhibit the same disregard for the value of human life
as deliberate or premeditated murderers, they are viewed as deserving of
the same serious sanctions.

Examples of the kinds of conduct which would demonstrate "depraved
heart" murder at common law include: the firing of a loaded gun, without
provocation, into a moving train and the resultant death of an innocent
bystander; the discharge of a firearm into a crowd of people, operating
a vehicle at high speed, placing obstructions on a railroad track,
throwing a heavy piece of timber from a roof onto a crowded street;
pointing a revolver loaded with a single cartridge and firing it on the
third pull of the trigger during a game of Russian Roulette; firing
several shots into a home known to be occupied; intending to shoot over
a victim\'s head in order to scare him, but hitting him by "mistake;"
and throwing a heavy beer glass at a woman carrying a lighted oil lamp.

The Pennsylvania General Assembly first divided the crime of murder into
degrees in 1794. In 1861, the territory of Colorado adopted the
innovative degree structure introduced by Pennsylvania, and classified
murder into two degrees. The earliest Colorado murder statutes embraced
as murder in the first degree more than premeditated or intentional
murder. Also classified as murder in the first degree were those
homicides perpetrated by an "act greatly dangerous to the lives of
others and indicating a depraved mind, regardless of human life."

From Colorado\'s earliest days the legislature has elected to punish the
forerunner of extreme indifference murder as murder of the highest
degree. The language quoted above remained a fixture of Colorado\'s
murder statutes despite periodic updating and revising of the state\'s
criminal laws.

The appearance of the Model Penal Code prompted the Colorado General
Assembly to recodify the state\'s criminal laws in the 1972 Colorado
Criminal Code (Code). Effective July 1, 1972, the new Code reflected
many reforms recommended by the Model Penal Code, particularly the use
of four concepts to find the mental culpability required of most crimes.
At the same time, the Code retained various measures of common law
origin, including the degree structure for murder. The new first-degree
murder statute proscribed premeditated and felony murder, as well as a
modernized form of depraved heart murder.

What has consistently exercised the legislature in proscribing extreme
indifference murder is aggravated recklessness, not that practical
certainty of death which is at the heart of the second-degree murder
statute. This interpretation is supported by section 210.1 of the Model
Penal Code, a major source for the 1972 revision of the Colorado
Criminal Code. That section proscribes as murder, homicides committed
"purposely or knowingly," as well as homicides "committed recklessly
under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of
human life."

The comments to the Model Penal Code state that "there is a kind of
reckless homicide that cannot fairly be distinguished in grading terms
from homicides committed purposely or knowingly." Ordinary recklessness
is sufficient for conviction of manslaughter. In a prosecution for
murder, however, the code calls for the further judgment "whether the
actor\'s conscious disregard of the risk, under the circumstances,
manifests extreme indifference to the value of human life." Whether an
actor\'s recklessness is so extreme is a question which "must be left
directly to the trier of fact under instructions which make it clear
that recklessness that can fairly be assimilated to purpose or knowledge
should be treated as murder\...." The comments to this section of the
Model Penal Code list as examples of that extreme or aggravated
recklessness which would qualify as criminal homicide: shooting into a
crowd, an occupied house, or a moving automobile.

What the legislature sought to proscribe, especially through its 1981
amendments, was aggravated or extremely reckless conduct, under
circumstances manifesting cold-blooded disregard for the value of human
life generally.

The 1981 addition of the words "universal malice" and "generally" to the
language of the statute is an unmistakable indication of the legislative
intent to limit the application of extreme indifference murder to
situations in which the actor demonstrates an indifference to human life
generally, as distinguished from indifference to, or willingness to
take, a particular human life. This interpretation is supported by the
addition of the words "or persons" following person in the statute.

These changes reinforce the element of cold-bloodedness. When a person
creates a grave risk of death to a person or persons and kills for
essentially no reason, or upon slight or insufficient provocation
without knowing or caring who the victim may be, the state is justified
in treating the crime as first-degree murder. The amended statute
emphasizes those crucial factors which make extreme indifference murder
a more serious crime than second-degree murder, even assuming an
identical mens rea requirement for both crimes.

Rather than attempting to define a heightened degree of awareness more
culpable than acting "knowingly," and at the same time avoiding the
confusion which has accompanied the division of "intentionally" into
specific and general categories, the legislature has attempted to
proscribe a kind of knowing, killing conduct which it considers to be of
greater social consequence and which merits greater punishment. The
extreme indifference murder charge is more blameworthy than the
second-degree murder charge, because the defendant\'s conduct
demonstrates that his lack of care and concern for the value of human
life generally are extreme, and that the circumstances of his actions
evidence that aggravated recklessness or cold-bloodedness which has come
to be known as "universal malice."

Further, the circumstances under which an act is performed may have a
significant effect upon the legal sanction imposed. If, for example, a
person "knowingly causes the death of another person under circumstances
where the act causing the death was performed upon a sudden heat of
passion," he is guilty of manslaughter rather than first-degree murder
under the Colorado Criminal Code.

A comparison of the two statutes reveals that extreme indifference
murder contains an element in addition to those required for
second-degree murder. A person commits the crime of extreme indifference
murder if: (1) under circumstances evidencing an attitude of universal
malice manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life
generally; (2) he knowingly engages in conduct which creates a grave
risk of death to a person, or persons, and (3) thereby causes the death
of another. By comparison, a person commits the crime of second-degree
murder if he: (1) knowingly causes the death of a person, but (2) not
after deliberation.

The presence of this additional element in the definition of extreme
indifference murder requires the prosecution to prove that the
defendant\'s conduct manifested extreme indifference to the value of
human life generally, and that the circumstances evidence an attitude of
universal malice.

It is rational for the legislature to differently punish knowing conduct
of a type directed against a particular individual, and knowing, killing
conduct---aggravated recklessness or cold-bloodedness---which by its
very nature evidences a willingness to take human life without regard to
the victim. A more specific actus reus is sufficient to distinguish
prohibited conduct

In summary, we uphold the constitutionality of section 18--3--102(1)(d),
Colorado\'s extreme indifference murder statute. As amended, the
statute, proscribing as it does knowing, killing conduct "under
circumstances evidencing an attitude of universal malice manifesting
extreme indifference to the value of human life generally," is
qualitatively and categorically distinct from the kind of knowing
killing proscribed by the second-degree murder statute. In returning the
statute in 1981 to its common law and historical roots of
cold-bloodedness or aggravated recklessness, the legislature has
provided an intelligible standard of criminal culpability. A person of
average intelligence can reasonably distinguish this offense from
conduct proscribed by the second-degree murder statute. That is all that
is necessary to distinguish the statutes in the wake of an equal
protection challenge.

Because a single criminal transaction may give rise to the violation of
more than one statute, it is for the trier of fact to decide whether the
facts of the individual case justify a finding that the defendant is
guilty of extreme indifference, as opposed to second-degree, murder. In
an extreme indifference murder case, the jury must make judgments of a
distinct kind beyond what is necessary for a verdict of guilty to
second-degree murder. It must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt
that the degree of indifference to human life generally shown by the
defendant in committing murder was extreme, and committed under
circumstances evidencing universal malice.

A variety of factors may exhibit a legally sufficient degree of
cold-bloodedness or aggravated recklessness to support the jury\'s
finding that the defendant\'s conduct should be penalized as
first-degree murder under the extreme indifference statute. The nature,
duration and intensity of the actor\'s culpable state of mind, his
manner of killing, his relationship to the victim(s), and the presence
or absence of mitigating factors---may all affect a jury\'s
determination of whether the extreme indifference statute fits the facts
of a particular case.

We reverse the district court rulings, and remand both cases with
directions to reinstate the extreme indifference counts in the
informations.

 

 

 

3.3.3

Felony Murder

 

The felony murder rule is one of the most controversial in all of
criminal law. It allows a defendant to be convicted of murder if it is
shown that a death occured in the course of a felony, even if the
defendant had no mens rea whatsoever with regard to the death of the
victim or of anyone else. We investigate the rule, its justifications,
and the limits courts and legislatures have placed on it to minimize the
inequities that might result from the rule\'s broadest application.

3.3.3.1.1

Auman v. People

 

In the early months of 2001, well-known journalist and author Hunter S.
Thompson received several letters from the Colorado State Penitentiary;
those letters continued for months and described the plight of a
Colorado woman who was serving a life sentence without the possibility
of parole for a murder she did not herself commit. Moved by her story,
in June 2004, Thompson co-wrote a piece in [Vanity Fair
Magazine](https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2004/6/prisoner-of-denver)
that highlighted the story of this Colorado woman who was convicted of
murder despite being handcuffed in the back of a police car when one of
the arresting officers was shot and killed by one of her accomplices;
this woman was Lisl Auman. The article, her website: "lisl.com", and the
newfound friendship between Auman and Thompson led to stars like Johnny
Depp, Jack Nicholson, Benicio del Toro and Woody Harrelson bringing her
case to the public attention. Ultimately, Auman served seven years in a
Colorado State Penitentiary before her conviction was overturned by the
Colorado Supreme Court in March 2005. The Colorado Supreme Court threw
out the felony murder and burglary convictions, stating the trial judge
left out "knowingly" when instructing jury about the elements of
second-degree burglary. Auman subsequently pled guilty to avoid a
retrial. She was subsequently released to Community Corrections where
she lived in a halfway house for about nine months and then eventually
returned into the Auman family home. Although perhaps one her greatest
champions, Thompson never saw Auman's release; he passed away in 2005.

 

### *Auman v. People*

Supreme Court of Colorado

109 P.3d 647 (Colo. 2005)

 

Auman was convicted of felony murder for her role in an alleged burglary
which resulted in the shooting death of a Denver police officer.

Auman had rented a room at an eleven-bedroom lodge (the Lodge) in
Buffalo Creek, Colorado and had dated another Lodge tenant, Shawn
Cheever, while she was there. Approximately one week before the alleged
burglary, Auman learned that Cheever no longer wanted to continue his
relationship with her.

Auman made plans to move out of the Lodge and to move in with her
friend, Demetria Soriano, at Soriano\'s apartment in southeast Denver.
In the process of moving her things out, Auman and the others with her
broke the padlock to Cheever's room, and removed some of his belongings
as well as some of Auman\'s things which were also in Cheever\'s room.

After loading the items into two cars they had driven to the Lodge, the
group drove away in their separate cars. When the police attempted to
stop the car that Auman was riding in, Matthew Jaehnig, the driver of
that car, led law enforcement officers on a high-speed chase into
Denver. During this chase, and while Auman held the steering wheel,
Jaehnig shot at an officer\'s car with an assault rifle. He then drove
to the apartment complex to which Auman was moving.

Upon reaching the apartment complex, police officers saw Auman and
Jaehnig run into a small alcove of the complex, and, shortly thereafter,
Auman surrendered to police. She had been under arrest for approximately
five minutes when a Denver police officer, Bruce VanderJagt, who was
searching for Jaehnig, looked around the corner of the alcove and was
shot and killed by Jaehnig. In the period between her arrest and the
fatal shooting, Auman did not tell police, despite their repeated
questions, that she knew that Jaehnig was probably still cornered in the
alcove and that he was armed with an assault rifle.

A conviction for the crime of felony murder requires that a death occur
in the commission of a specifically enumerated felony. Here, Auman\'s
conviction for second degree burglary served as the predicate felony for
her felony-murder conviction. Second degree burglary requires that a
defendant possess the intent to commit a crime when he or she breaks an
entrance into a building or occupied structure. The People argued that
Auman committed felony murder because she was guilty of burglary and
because \[the officer's\] death was caused by Jaehnig in immediate
flight from that burglary. The People argued that Auman\'s arrest did
not terminate her liability for felony murder while Jaehnig\'s immediate
flight continued and while she lied to and withheld information from
police.

The People charged that Auman intended to commit the crime of theft when
she, and the others with her, broke the lock and entered Cheever\'s
room. Hence, the jury\'s understanding of the definition of theft formed
an essential element of Auman\'s conviction for felony murder.

On its face, Colorado\'s felony-murder statute is broad in scope. The
words of the statute provide that if a person commits a specifically
enumerated felony and an innocent party dies during that felony or
during immediate flight from that felony, then that person commits
felony murder:

A person commits the crime of murder in the first degree if: \...
\[a\]cting either alone or with one or more persons, he \[or she\]
commits or attempts to commit \... burglary \... and, in the course of
or in furtherance of the crime that he \[or she\] is committing or
attempting to commit, or of immediate flight therefrom, the death of a
person, other than one of the participants, is caused by anyone. §
18--3--102(1)(b), 6 C.R.S. (1999).

Under this statute, a defendant who commits a predicate felony may be
liable when death occurs during either of two events, namely: (1) "in
the course of or in furtherance of the crime that \[the defendant\] is
committing or attempting to commit;" or, (2) "in the course of or in
furtherance \... of immediate flight therefrom."

It does not matter that the defendant had no intent to kill or that the
defendant did not cause the killing. Liability arises from the
defendant\'s participation in, and intent to commit, one of the
specifically named, or predicate, felonies. According to the
felony-murder doctrine, the intent to kill is imputed from the
participant\'s intent to commit the predicate felony.

Here, we address only whether the death was caused in the course of or
in furtherance of immediate flight from the predicate felony, which in
this case was burglary.

According to the plain language of the immediate flight provision of the
statute, there are four limitations on liability for felony murder when
a death occurs during flight from the predicate felony.

First, the flight from the predicate felony must be "immediate," which
requires a close temporal connection between the predicate felony, the
flight, and the resulting death. 

Second, the word "flight" limits felony-murder liability in such cases
to those circumstances in which death is caused while a participant is
escaping or running away from the predicate felony. 

Third, the death must occur either "in the course of" or "in furtherance
of" immediate flight, so that a defendant commits felony murder only if
a death is caused during a participant\'s immediate flight or while a
person is acting to promote immediate flight from the predicate felony. 

Fourth, the immediate flight must be "therefrom," indicating that the
flight must be from the predicate felony, as opposed to being from some
other episode or event.

The plain language of our statute supports the legal principle that a
co-participant in a predicate felony may be liable for felony murder
even after arrest while another participant remains in immediate flight.
The statute deems conduct as murder when one participates in the
predicate felony and a death is caused in the course of or in
furtherance of "immediate flight," which, by its terms, is not limited
to the flight of any particular participant. The felony-murder statute
regards all participants as liable for felony murder when a person acts
"with one or more persons" in the commission of a specifically
enumerated felony and death is "caused by anyone" "in the course of or
in furtherance \... of immediate flight" from the predicate felony. 

Just as important as what the statute says is what the statute does not
say. As it is worded, the statute does not differentiate between
liability for participants in the predicate felony who are in immediate
flight and those who are not; nor does the statute state that some
participants may be liable for a death that occurs in the course of or
in furtherance of immediate flight but that others may not. The statute
also does not state that if a co-participant\'s actual flight ends as a
result of arrest, and another participant remains in flight, that
immediate flight has ended for the co-participant under arrest. Most
importantly, the statute does not say that a co-participant may be
liable for felony murder for only those deaths caused during that
co-participant\'s immediate flight. We should not construe these
omissions by the General Assembly as unintentional.

We next turn to the statutory affirmative defense to determine how it
affects our analysis of this statutory crime. The General Assembly
created an affirmative defense to felony murder that allows a defendant
to avoid felony-murder prosecution if "he not only had nothing to do
with the killing itself, but was unarmed and had no reason to believe
that any of his confederates were armed or intended to engage in any
conduct dangerous to life." § 40--3--102. The affirmative defense also
provides that if a defendant discovers that a co-participant is armed or
dangerous during the commission of the crime or in flight therefrom, the
defendant may obtain the benefit of this defense by immediately
disengaging from either the predicate felony or the flight.

Like the plain language of the statutory offense, the affirmative
defense provides no support for the theory that arrest, by itself,
terminates a co-participant\'s liability for felony murder as a matter
of law. This conclusion, however, does not mean a jury should not
consider a co-participant\'s arrest as a factor in deciding whether the
prosecution has satisfied its burden of proving that the affirmative
defense does not apply.

### *People v. Phillips*

California Supreme Court

64 Cal.2d 574 (1966)

TOBRINER, J.

Defendant, a doctor of chiropractic, appeals from a judgment of the
Superior Court of Los Angeles County convicting him of second degree
murder in connection with the death from cancer of one of his patients.
We reverse solely on the ground that the trial court erred in giving a
felony-murder instruction.

Linda Epping died on December 29, 1961, at the age of 8, from a rare and
fast-growing form of eye cancer. Linda\'s mother first observed a
swelling over the girl\'s left eye in June of that year. The doctor whom
she consulted recommended that Linda be taken to Dr. Straatsma, an
opthalmologist at the UCLA Medical Center. On July 10th Dr. Straatsma
first saw Linda; on July 17th the girl, suffering great pain, was
admitted to the center. Dr. Straatsma performed an exploratory operation
and the resulting biopsy established the nature of the child\'s
affliction.

Dr. Straatsma advised Linda\'s parents that her only hope for survival
lay in immediate surgical removal of the affected eye. The Eppings were
loath to permit such surgery, but on the morning of July 21st Mr. Epping
called the hospital and gave his oral consent. The Eppings arrived at
the hospital that afternoon to consult with the surgeon. While waiting
they encountered a Mrs. Eaton who told them that defendant had cured her
son of a brain tumor without surgery.

Mrs. Epping called defendant at his office. According to the Eppings,
defendant repeatedly assured them that he could cure Linda without
surgery. They testified that defendant urged them to take Linda out of
the hospital, claiming that the hospital was \"an experimental place,\"
that the doctors there would use Linda as \"a human guinea pig\" and
would relieve the Eppings of their money as well.

The Eppings testified that in reliance upon defendant\'s statements they
took Linda out of the hospital and placed her under defendant\'s care.
They stated that if defendant had not represented to them that he could
cure the child without surgery and that the UCLA doctors were only
interested in experimentation, they would have proceeded with the
scheduled operation. The prosecution introduced medical testimony which
tended to prove that if Linda had undergone surgery on July 21st her
life would have been prolonged or she would have been completely cured.

Defendant treated Linda from July 22 to August 12, 1961. He charged an
advance fee of \$500 for three months\' care as well as a sum exceeding
\$200 for pills and medicines. On August 13th Linda\'s condition had not
improved; the Eppings dismissed defendant.

Later the Eppings sought to cure Linda by means of a Mexican herbal drug
known as yerba mansa and, about the 1st of September, they placed her
under the care of the Christian Science movement. They did not take her
back to the hospital for treatment.

Defendant testified that he knew that he could not cure cancer, that he
did not represent to the Eppings that he could do so, that he urged them
to return Linda to the hospital and that he agreed to treat her only
when it became clear that the Eppings would never consent to surgery. He
further testified that in administering treatment he sought to build up
Linda\'s general health and so prolong her life. He insisted that he had
never purported to \"treat\" cancer as such, but only to give
\"supportive\" care to the body as a whole. He variously described his
purpose as being \"to build up her resistance,\" \"assisting the body to
overcome its own deficiencies\" and \"supporting the body defenses.\"

As we have noted, the trial court gave an instruction on felony murder;
we point out that, although defendant could, of course, be prosecuted
for grand theft, such a crime, not an inherently dangerous felony, does
not support an instruction on felony murder. The giving of that
instruction caused defendant prejudice and compels reversal. Initially,
however, we dispose of defendant\'s argument that the prosecution failed
to establish such causal relationship between defendant\'s conduct and
the death as is requisite to his criminal responsibility.

Dr. Straatsma testified with \"reasonable medical certainty\" that the
performance of the operation on July 21st would have extended Linda\'s
life by a minimum of two months. He also gave his opinion that surgery
on that date could have effected a complete cure.

The evidence established that the tumor grew dramatically during the
period in which Linda submitted to defendant\'s ministrations; Dr.
Straatsma testified that her prospects dimmed rapidly with the passage
of time. The jury could properly have concluded that defendant\'s
conduct in preventing the operation during his treatment measurably
reduced the period by which surgery would have extended Linda\'s life
and significantly diminished her chances for a complete recovery.

Defendant challenges the propriety of the trial court\'s instructions to
the jury. The court gave the following tripartite instruction on murder
in the second degree:

\"\[T\]he unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought,
but without a deliberately formed and premeditated intent to kill, is
murder of the second degree:\"

\"(1) If the killing proximately results from an unlawful act, the
natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act is
deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers
the life of another, or\"

\"(2) If the circumstances proximately causing the killing show an
abandoned and malignant heart, or\"

\"(3) If the killing is done in the perpetration or attempt to
perpetrate a felony such as Grand Theft. If a death occurs in the
perpetration of a course of conduct amounting to Grand Theft, which
course of conduct is a proximate cause of the unlawful killing of a
human being, such course of conduct constitutes murder in the second
degree, even though the death was not intended.\"

The third part of this instruction rests upon the felony-murder rule and
reflects the prosecution\'s theory that defendant\'s conduct amounted to
grand theft by false pretenses in violation of Penal Code section 484.

Despite defendant\'s contention that the Penal Code does not expressly
set forth any provision for second degree felony murder and that,
therefore, we should not follow any such doctrine here, the concept lies
imbedded in our law. \[T\]he cases hold that the perpetration of some
felonies, exclusive of those enumerated in Penal Code section 189, may
provide the basis for a murder conviction under the felony-murder rule.

We have held, however, that only such felonies as are in themselves
\"inherently dangerous to human life\" can support the application of
the felony-murder rule. We have ruled that in assessing such peril to
human life inherent in any given felony \"we look to the elements of the
felony in the abstract, not the particular \'facts\' of the case.\"

We have thus recognized that the felony-murder doctrine expresses a
highly artificial concept that deserves no extension beyond its required
application. Indeed, the rule itself has been abandoned by the courts of
England, where it had its inception. It has been subjected to severe and
sweeping criticism. No case to our knowledge in any jurisdiction has
held that because death results from a course of conduct involving a
felonious perpetration of a fraud, the felony-murder doctrine can be
invoked.

Admitting that grand theft is not inherently dangerous to life, the
prosecution asks us to encompass the entire course of defendant\'s
conduct so that we may incorporate such elements as would make his crime
inherently dangerous. In so framing the definition of a given felony for
the purpose of assessing its inherent peril to life the prosecution
would abandon the statutory definition of the felony as such and
substitute the factual elements of defendant\'s actual conduct. In the
present case the Attorney General would characterize that conduct as
\"grand theft medical fraud,\" and this newly created \"felony,\" he
urges, clearly involves danger to human life and supports an application
of the felony-murder rule.

To fragmentize the \"course of conduct\" of defendant so that the
felony-murder rule applies if any segment of that conduct may be
considered dangerous to life would widen the rule beyond calculation. It
would then apply not only to the commission of specific felonies, which
are themselves dangerous to life, but to the perpetration of any felony
during which defendant may have acted in such a manner as to endanger
life.

The proposed approach would entail the rejection of our holding in
*People v. Williams,* 63 Cal. 2d 452. That case limited the
felony-murder doctrine to such felonies as were themselves inherently
dangerous to life. That decision eschews the prosecution\'s present
sweeping concept because, once the Legislature\'s own definition is
discarded, the number or nature of the contextual elements which could
be incorporated into an expanded felony terminology would be limitless.
We have been, and remain, unwilling to embark on such an uncharted sea
of felony murder.

The felony-murder instruction should not, then, have been given; its
rendition, further, worked prejudice upon defendant. It withdrew from
the jury the issue of malice, permitting a conviction upon the bare
showing that Linda\'s death proximately resulted from conduct of
defendant amounting to grand theft. The instruction as rendered did not
require the jury to find either express malice or the implied malice
which is manifested in an \"intent with conscious disregard for life to
commit acts likely to kill.\"

The instruction thus relieved the jury of the necessity of finding one
of the elements of the crime of murder. Even if the evidence could have
supported a finding of implied malice, the instruction failed to require
the jury so to determine. \"\[D\]efendants have a constitutional right
to have the jury determine every material issue presented by the
evidence\...\" The denial of defendant\'s right to a determination by
the jury as to whether he acted with malice resulted in a miscarriage of
justice within the meaning of California Constitution, article VI,
section 4 1/2.

Hines v. State

 

### *Hines v. State*

Supreme Court of Georgia

578 S.E.2d 868 (Ga. 2003)

 

FLETCHER, Chief Justice.

While hunting, Robert Lee Hines mistook his friend Steven Wood for a
turkey and shot him dead. A jury convicted Hines of felony murder based
on the underlying crime of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,
but acquitted him of felony murder based on the underlying felony of
misuse of a firearm while hunting. On appeal, Hines contends that the
jury\'s verdict is invalid because the jury cannot acquit him of killing
the victim by misusing a firearm, yet convict him of killing the victim
by possession of the same firearm, without having made inconsistent
factual findings. Because Georgia does not recognize an inconsistent
verdict rule and Hines\'s other enumerations are without merit, we
affirm.

Taken in the light most favorable to the jury\'s verdict of guilty, the
evidence at trial showed that, late in the afternoon of April 8, 2001,
Hines and some of his friends and relatives went turkey hunting. They
split into two groups, with Hines and his friend Randy Stoker hunting
together in one area, and the victim, the victim\'s wife, and Hines\'s
son hunting in a different area, approximately one-fourth mile away. As
the sky was growing dark, Hines heard a turkey gobble, \"saw it fan out
and shot.\" Hines\'s shot went through heavy foliage and hit the victim
approximately eighty feet away. Immediately thereafter, the victim\'s
wife screamed, \"You shot Wood.\" Hines and his son went for help, but
the victim died before help could arrive.

On his return, Hines tried to convince his son and Stoker to take
responsibility for the shooting. They both refused. The entire group,
however, agreed to say that they did not know who had shot Wood. Hines
removed his camouflage clothing and hid his shotgun and hunting gear
before the police arrived.

Two days later, Hines admitted he had shot Wood and showed the police
where he had hidden his shotgun. Hines\'s son showed the police where he
had hidden Hines\'s hunting clothing and gear, which included unopened
cans of beer. An open beer can and foam insulation wrap that belonged to
Hines were found near where Hines had fired the fatal shot.

We conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient for a reasonable
trier of fact to have found Hines guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

The jury acquitted Hines of felony murder based on misuse of a firearm
while hunting and convicted him of felony murder based on possession of
a firearm by a convicted felon. Hines contends that the verdict is void
because the jury made inconsistent determinations that he did not cause
Wood\'s death by misusing a firearm, but did cause his death by
possessing the same firearm.

Georgia does not recognize an inconsistent verdict rule, which would
permit a defendant to challenge the factual findings underlying a guilty
verdict on one count as inconsistent with the findings underlying a not
guilty verdict on a different count. A conviction on one count and
acquittal on another related count may reflect a compromise or lenity by
the jury rather than inconsistent factual conclusions, and Georgia
courts generally will not look behind the jury\'s decision to convict on
certain counts and acquit on other counts. Therefore, Hines\'s
enumeration is without merit.

Hines contends that a convicted felon\'s possession of a firearm while
turkey hunting cannot be one of the inherently dangerous felonies
required to support a conviction for felony murder. \"The only
limitation on the type of felony that may serve as an underlying felony
for a felony murder conviction is that the felony must be inherently
dangerous to human life.\" A felony is \"inherently dangerous\" when it
is \"\`dangerous per se\'\" or \"\'by its circumstances create\[s\] a
foreseeable risk of death.\'\" Depending on the facts, possession of a
firearm by a convicted felon can be an inherently dangerous felony.

In *Ford v. State,* the defendant was a convicted felon who was
unloading a handgun when it accidentally discharged, went through the
floor, and killed an occupant of the apartment below. A jury convicted
Ford for felony murder based on his felonious possession of a firearm.
This Court reversed, finding that, because no evidence showed the
defendant knew there was an apartment below him or that the victim was
present, his possession of a firearm could not support a conviction for
felony murder.

In contrast to *Ford,* Hines intentionally fired his shotgun intending
to hit his target. He had been drinking before he went hunting, and
there was evidence that he had been drinking while hunting. He knew that
other hunters were in the area and was unaware of their exact location.
He also knew that other people visited the area in which he was hunting.
He took an unsafe shot at dusk, through heavy foliage, at a target
eighty feet away that he had not positively identified as a turkey.
Under these circumstances, we conclude that Hines\'s illegal possession
of a firearm created a foreseeable risk of death. Accordingly, Hines\'s
violation of the prohibition against convicted felons possessing
firearms was an inherently dangerous felony that could support a felony
murder conviction.

Judgment affirmed.

State v. Sturdivant

 

TW: Child Abuse

 

### *State v. Sturdivant*

Supreme Court of Florida

94 So.3d 434 (2012)

 

The felony-murder statute in Florida provides that first-degree murder
includes: "The unlawful killing of a human being \... \[w\]hen committed
by a person engaged in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to
perpetrate, any \... \[a\]ggravated child abuse\...." § 782.04(1)(a)
2.h., Fla. Stat. (2007). In this case, Sturdivant "was indicted by a
grand jury for first-degree felony murder and aggravated child abuse. As
to the felony-murder charge, the indictment alleged that \[Sturdivant\]
killed the victim while committing aggravated child abuse by slapping
the \[two-year-old\] victim into a wall. The allegation was the same for
the aggravated child abuse charge." \[T\]he State, out of an abundance
of caution, also filed an information charging second-degree murder on
the same allegation as had been made in the indictment. The first-degree
and second-degree murder cases were consolidated.

Following the trial, the jury returned verdicts finding Sturdivant
guilty of first-degree felony murder, second-degree murder, and
aggravated child abuse.

On appeal, Sturdivant argued that he could not be convicted of both the
first-degree felony murder and the underlying felony of aggravated child
abuse because of the merger doctrine.

The merger doctrine is a principle of statutory construction rather than
a principle of constitutional law. The origins of the merger doctrine
have been explained as follows:

Conceived in the nineteenth century, the merger doctrine was developed
\... as a shorthand explanation for the conclusion that the
felony-murder rule should not be applied in circumstances where the only
underlying (or "predicate") felony committed by the defendant was
assault. The name of the doctrine derived from the characterization of
the assault as an offense that "merged" with the resulting homicide.

With respect to the merger doctrine being one of preserving legislative
intent, the Tennessee Supreme Court has explained:

Courts have generally declined to hold that the merger doctrine
implicates any principles of constitutional law. Instead, courts have
viewed the merger doctrine as a principle for preserving legislative
intent and, more specifically, as a principle that preserves "some
meaningful domain in which the Legislature\'s careful graduation of
homicide offenses can be implemented."

The court observed that "\[t\]he doctrine has been applied largely in
those states where the felony murder statute fails to specifically list
the felonies capable of supporting a felony murder conviction."

In a prior decision, this Court also recognized this distinction.  In
*Robles v. State*, 188 So.2d 789, 792 (Fla.1966), this Court
distinguished between a felony-murder statute that provided that "any"
felony could serve as a basis for felony murder and an enumerated
felony-murder statute, such as Florida\'s. In that case, the defendant
asserted that the facts of the case---where the victim was killed during
the course of a burglary---were not appropriate for the application of
the felony-murder rule. The defendant directed the Court\'s attention to
a line of New York cases holding that the felony-murder rule does not
apply unless the felony is separate and independent from the homicide
and where the underlying felony is not separate and independent, the
underlying felony and the homicide merge. This Court disagreed, noting
the difference between the general catch-all felony-murder statute in
New York and the enumerated felony-murder statute in Florida, which
listed burglary as an offense on which felony-murder can be predicated:

As appellant acknowledges, the concern of the New York court, which was
to preserve the integrity of the statutory degrees of homicide, resulted
from the fact that the statute of that state makes a homicide committed
in the perpetration of any felony first degree murder. Since the phrase
"any felony" is broad enough to include even the aggravated assault that
is usually involved in any homicide, the result would be that
substantially every homicide would constitute first degree murder.

It was to avoid this result that the New York court adopted the doctrine
that the supporting felony had to be independent of the homicide\...

It is obvious that the problem that motivated the New York court to
adopt the above rule cannot exist under a statute like Florida\'s, which
limits the felony-murder rule to homicides committed in the perpetration
of specified felonies, not including assault in any of its forms.

Accordingly, this Court concluded that the concern motivating the New
York courts---preserving the integrity of statutory degrees of
homicide---did not compel the same result in Florida.

Florida\'s felony-murder statute specifically lists the underlying
offenses that can justify a conviction for first-degree felony murder.
Aggravated child abuse is one of the enumerated felonies in the statute.
The felony-murder statute provides that first-degree murder includes:
"The unlawful killing of a human being \... \[w\]hen committed by a
person engaged in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to perpetrate,
any \... \[a\]ggravated child abuse\...." § 782.04(1)(a) 2.h., Fla.
Stat. Aggravated child abuse is defined as follows:

"Aggravated child abuse" occurs when a person:

\(a\) Commits aggravated battery on a child;

\(b\) Willfully tortures, maliciously punishes, or willfully and
unlawfully cages a child; or

\(c\) Knowingly or willfully abuses a child and in so doing causes great
bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement to the
child.

§ 827.03(2), Fla. Stat. (2007). The statute defines "maliciously" as
follows:

For purposes of this section, "maliciously" means wrongfully,
intentionally, and without legal justification or excuse. Maliciousness
may be established by circumstances from which one could conclude that a
reasonable parent would not have engaged in the damaging acts toward the
child for any valid reason and that the primary purpose of the acts was
to cause the victim unjustifiable pain or injury.

§ 827.03(4), Fla. Stat.

Sturdivant argues that the merger doctrine should apply in his case,
which would preclude his felony-murder conviction being based on
aggravated child abuse consisting of a single violent act. However, we
note that the merger doctrine "has been applied largely in those states
where the felony murder statute fails to specifically list the felonies
capable of supporting a felony murder conviction. Where a 'legislature
explicitly states that a particular felony is a predicate felony for
felony-murder, no "merger" occurs.'" Here, the Florida Legislature has
specifically listed aggravated child abuse as a predicate offense that
will support a conviction for first-degree felony murder. Accordingly,
we conclude that the merger doctrine does not apply where the underlying
felony is the enumerated felony of aggravated child abuse.

 

 

 

3.3.3.3.2

People v. Chun

 

### *People v. Chun*

California Supreme Court

203 P.3d 425 (Cal. 2009)

 

In this murder case, the trial court instructed the jury on second
degree felony murder with shooting at an occupied vehicle under Penal
Code section 246 the underlying felony.† We granted review to consider
various issues concerning the validity and scope of the second degree
felony-murder rule.

Section 187, subdivision (a), defines murder as "the unlawful killing of
a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought." ...Murder is
divided into first and second degree murder. (§ 189.) "Second degree
murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice, but without
the additional elements (i.e., willfulness, premeditation, and
deliberation) that would support a conviction of first degree murder."

Critical for our purposes is that the crime of murder, as defined in
section 187, includes, as an element, malice. Section 188 defines
malice. It may be either express or implied. It is express "when there
is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of
a fellow creature." It is implied "when no considerable provocation
appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an
abandoned and malignant heart." This definition of implied malice is
quite vague. Trial courts do not instruct the jury in the statutory
language of an abandoned and malignant heart. Doing so would provide the
jury with little guidance. "The statutory definition of implied malice
has never proved of much assistance in defining the concept in concrete
terms." Accordingly, the statutory definition permits, even requires,
judicial interpretation. We have interpreted implied malice as having
"both a physical and a mental component. The physical component is
satisfied by the performance of 'an act, the natural consequences of
which are dangerous to life.' The mental component is the requirement
that the defendant 'knows that his conduct endangers the life of another
and \... acts with a conscious disregard for life.'"

A defendant may also be found guilty of murder under the felony-murder
rule. The felony-murder rule makes a killing while committing certain
felonies murder without the necessity of further examining the
defendant\'s mental state.  The rule has two applications: first degree
felony murder and second degree felony murder. We have said that first
degree felony murder is a "creation of statute" (i.e., § 189) but,
because no statute specifically describes it, that second degree felony
murder is a "common law doctrine." First degree felony murder is a
killing during the course of a felony specified in section 189, such as
rape, burglary, or robbery. Second degree felony murder is "an unlawful
killing in the course of the commission of a felony that is inherently
dangerous to human life but is not included among the felonies
enumerated in section 189\...."

In \[People v.\] *Patterson*, Justice Kennard explained the reasoning
behind and the justification for the second degree felony-murder rule:
"The second degree felony-murder rule eliminates the need for the
prosecution to establish the mental component \[of
conscious-disregard-for-life malice\]. The justification therefor is
that, when society has declared certain inherently dangerous conduct to
be felonious, a defendant should not be allowed to excuse himself by
saying he was unaware of the danger to life because, by declaring the
conduct to be felonious, society has warned him of the risk involved.
The physical requirement, however, remains the same; by committing a
felony inherently dangerous to life, the defendant has committed 'an
act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life' thus
satisfying the physical component of implied malice."

The second degree felony-murder rule is venerable. It "has been a part
of California\'s criminal law for many decades. But some former and
current members of this court have questioned the rule\'s validity
because no statute specifically addresses it. In line with these
concerns, defendant argues that the second degree felony-murder rule is
invalid on separation of powers grounds. As he points out, we have
repeatedly said that "'the power to define crimes and fix penalties is
vested exclusively in the legislative branch.' Defendant asks
rhetorically, "How, then, in light of the statutory abrogation of common
law crimes and the constitutional principle of separation of powers,
does second degree felony murder continue to exist when this court has
repeatedly acknowledged that the crime is a judicial creation?"

This court has never directly addressed these concerns and this
argument, or explained the statutory basis of the second degree
felony-murder rule. We do so now. We agree ... that there are no
nonstatutory crimes in this state. Some statutory or regulatory
provision must describe conduct as criminal in order for the courts to
treat that conduct as criminal. But, as we explain, the second degree
felony-murder rule, although derived from the common law, is based on
statute; it is simply another interpretation of section 188\'s abandoned
and malignant heart language.

Many provisions of the Penal Code were enacted using common law terms
that must be interpreted in light of the common law. For example,
section 484 defines theft as "feloniously" taking the property of
another. The term "feloniously"---which has little meaning by
itself---incorporates the common law requirement that the perpetrator
must intend to permanently deprive the owner of possession of the
property. Accordingly, we have looked to the common law to determine the
exact contours of that requirement. Thus, the
intent-to-permanently-deprive requirement, although nonstatutory in the
limited sense that no California statute uses those words, is based on
statute. The murder statutes are similarly derived from the common law.
"It will be presumed \... that in enacting a statute the Legislature was
familiar with the relevant rules of the common law, and, when it couches
its enactments in common law language, that its intent was to continue
those rules in statutory form."

Even conscious-disregard-for-life malice is nonstatutory in the limited
sense that no California statute specifically uses those words. But that
form of implied malice is firmly based on statute; it is an
interpretation of section 188\'s abandoned and malignant heart language.
Similarly, the second degree felony-murder rule is nonstatutory in the
sense that no statute specifically spells it out, but it is also
statutory as another interpretation of the same "abandoned and malignant
heart" language.  We have said that the "felony-murder rule eliminates
the need for proof of malice in connection with a charge of murder,
thereby rendering irrelevant the presence or absence of actual malice,
both with regard to first degree felony murder and second degree felony
murder." But analytically, this is not precisely correct. The
felony-murder rule renders irrelevant conscious-disregard-for-life
malice, but it does not render malice itself irrelevant. Instead, the
felony-murder rule "acts as a substitute" for
conscious-disregard-for-life malice. It simply describes a different
form of malice under section 188. "The felony-murder rule imputes the
requisite malice for a murder conviction to those who commit a homicide
during the perpetration of a felony inherently dangerous to life."

Although today we reaffirm the constitutional validity of the
long-standing second degree felony-murder rule, we also recognize that
the rule has often been criticized and, indeed, described as disfavored.
We have repeatedly stated, as recently as 2005, that the rule "deserves
no extension beyond its required application." For these reasons,
although the second degree felony-murder rule originally applied to all
felonies, this court has subsequently restricted its scope in at least
two respects to ameliorate its perceived harshness.

First, the court restricted the felonies that could support a conviction
of second degree murder, based upon a felony-murder theory, to those
felonies that are "inherently dangerous to human life." Whether a felony
is inherently dangerous is determined from the elements of the felony in
the abstract, not the particular facts. This restriction is not at issue
here. Section 246 makes it a felony to "maliciously and willfully
discharge a firearm at an \... occupied motor vehicle\...." In Hansen,
we held that shooting at an "inhabited dwelling house" under section 246
is inherently dangerous even though the inhabited dwelling house does
not have to be actually occupied at the time of the shooting. That being
the case, shooting at a vehicle that is actually occupied clearly is
inherently dangerous.

But the second restriction---the "merger doctrine"---is very much at
issue. The merger doctrine developed due to the understanding that the
underlying felony must be an independent crime and not merely the
killing itself. Thus, certain underlying felonies "merge" with the
homicide and cannot be used for purposes of felony murder. The specific
question before us is how to apply the merger doctrine. The Court of
Appeal divided on the question and on how to apply our precedents. But
the majority and dissent agreed on one thing---that the current state of
the law regarding merger is "muddled." We agree that the scope and
application of the merger doctrine as applied to second degree murder
needs to be reconsidered

The merger doctrine arose in the seminal case of \[*People v. Ireland*\]
and hence sometimes is called the "Ireland merger doctrine." In
*Ireland*, the defendant shot and killed his wife, and was convicted of
second degree murder. The trial court instructed the jury on second
degree felony murder with assault with a deadly weapon the underlying
felony. We held the instruction improper, adopting the "so-called
'merger' doctrine" that had previously been developed in other
jurisdictions. We explained our reasons: "\[T\]he utilization of the
felony-murder rule in circumstances such as those before us extends the
operation of that rule 'beyond any rational function that it is designed
to serve. To allow such use of the felony-murder rule would effectively
preclude the jury from considering the issue of malice aforethought in
all cases wherein homicide has been committed as a result of a felonious
assault---a category which includes the great majority of all homicides.
This kind of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law. We
therefore hold that a second degree felony-murder instruction may not
properly be given when it is based upon a felony which is an integral
part of the homicide and which the evidence produced by the prosecution
shows to be an offense included in fact within the offense charged."

\[The Court then tracked its long history of felony murder decisions,
detailing the rule it adopted in *People v. Robertson*, 95 P.3d 872
(2004) and *People v. Randle*, 111 P.3d 987 (2005) that an assaultive
felony does not merge with a killing -- and can thus form the basis of a
felony murder prosecution -- if the assault was carried out for an
independent felonious purpose. For example in Robertson, the defendant
"claimed that he fired into the air in order to frighten away several
men who were burglarizing his car." The Court concluded in that case
that "the merger doctrine did not bar a felony murder prosecution." But
the independent felonious purpose doctrine remained controversial and,
after years of criticism, the Court chose Chun as the case to renounce
it\]

To avoid the anomaly of putting a person who merely intends to frighten
the victim in a worse legal position than the person who actually
intended to shoot at the victim, and the difficult question of whether
and how the jury should decide questions of merger, we need to
reconsider our holdings in *Robertson* and *Randle*. When the underlying
felony is assaultive in nature, such as a violation of section 246, we
now conclude that the felony merges with the homicide and cannot be the
basis of a felony-murder instruction. An "assaultive" felony is one that
involves a threat of immediate violent injury. In determining whether a
crime merges, the court looks to its elements and not the facts of the
case. Accordingly, if the elements of the crime have an assaultive
aspect, the crime merges with the underlying homicide even if the
elements also include conduct that is not assaultive. For example, in
*People v. Smith*, 678 P.2d 886 (1984) the court noted that child abuse
under section 273(a) "includes both active and passive conduct, i.e.,
child abuse by direct assault and child endangering by extreme neglect."
Looking to the facts before it, the court decided the offense was "of
the assaultive variety," and therefore merged. It reserved the question
whether the nonassaultive variety would merge. Under the approach we now
adopt, both varieties would merge. This approach both avoids the
necessity of consulting facts that might be disputed and extends the
protection of the merger doctrine to the potentially less culpable
defendant whose conduct is not assaultive.

This conclusion is also consistent with our repeatedly stated view that
the felony-murder rule should not be extended beyond its required
application. We do not have to decide at this point exactly what
felonies are assaultive in nature, and hence may not form the basis of a
felony-murder instruction, and which are inherently collateral to the
resulting homicide and do not merge. But shooting at an occupied vehicle
under section 246 is assaultive in nature and hence cannot serve as the
underlying felony for purposes of the felony-murder rule.

† Penal Code § 246 reads, in its entirety:

Any person who shall maliciously and willfully discharge a firearm at an
inhabited dwelling house, occupied building, occupied motor vehicle,
occupied aircraft, inhabited housecar, as defined in Section 362 of the
Vehicle Code, or inhabited camper, as defined in Section 243 of the
Vehicle Code, is guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be
punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, five, or seven
years, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term of not less than
six months and not exceeding one year.

As used in this section, "inhabited" means currently being used for

### *State v. Canola*

Supreme Court of New Jersey

374 A.2d 20 (N.J. 1977)

 

The facts of this case are adequately stated in the opinion of the
Appellate Division. For purposes of this determination they may be
summarized as follows. The owner of a jewelry store and his employee, in
an attempt to resist an armed robbery, engaged in a physical skirmish
with one of the four robbers. A second conspirator, called upon for
assistance, began shooting, and the store owner returned the gunfire.
Both the owner and the felon, one Lloredo, were fatally shot in the
exchange, the latter by the firearm of the owner.

Defendant and two others were indicted on two counts of murder, one
count of robbery and one count of having been armed during the robbery.
The murder counts were based on the deaths, respectively, of the robbery
victim and the co-felon. After trial on the murder counts defendant was
found guilty on both and was sentenced to concurrent terms of life
imprisonment. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the conviction
for the murder of the robbery victim, and this court denied a petition
for certification addressed thereto. However, when the Appellate
Division majority upheld the trial court\'s denial of a motion to
dismiss the count addressed to the homicide of the co-felon, Judge
Handler dissented.

Conventional formulations of the felony murder rule would not seem to
encompass liability in this case. As stated by Blackstone about the time
of the American Revolution, the rule was: \"And if one intends to do
another felony, and undesignedly kills a man, this is also murder.\" 4
Blackstone, Commentaries 200-201; and *see* *The State v. Cooper*, 13
N.J.L. 361, 370 (Sup. Ct. 1833); *State v. Madden*, 61 N.J. 377, 384
(1972). In such case the felonious intent supplies the malice requisite
for murder. Ibid. A recent study of the early formulations of the felony
murder rule by such authorities as Lord Coke, Foster and Blackstone and
of later ones by Judge Stephen and Justice Holmes concluded that they
were concerned solely with situations where the felon or a confederate
did the actual killing.

The precise issue in the present case is whether a broader concept than
the foregoing -- specifically, liability of a felon for the death of a
co-felon effected by one resisting the felony -- is required by the
language of our statute applicable to the general area of felony murder.
N.J.S.A. 2A:113-1. This reads:

If any person, in committing or attempting to commit arson, burglary,
kidnapping, rape, robbery, sodomy or any unlawful act against the peace
of this State, of which the probable consequences may be bloodshed,
kills another, *or if the death of anyone ensues from the committing or
attempting to commit any such crime or act*; or if any person kills a
judge, magistrate, sheriff, coroner, constable or other officer of
justice, either civil or criminal, of this state, or a marshal or other
officer of justice, either civil or criminal, of the United States, in
the execution of his office or duty, or kills any of his assistants,
whether specially called to his aid or not, endeavoring to preserve the
peace or apprehend a criminal, knowing the authority of such assistant,
or kills a private person endeavoring to suppress an affray, or to
apprehend a criminal, knowing the intention with which such private
person interposes, then *such person so killing is guilty of murder*.

The Appellate Division majority was of the view that the
above-emphasized portion of the statute, referred to by it as the
\"ensues clause,\" compelled the result it arrived at. It said:

We think it is clear that the clause was not intended to be mere
surplusage where it appears that the other provisions of the statute,
standing alone, embody the concept of felony murder under the common
law. Such an interpretation would violate one of the cardinal rules of
statutory construction that full force and effect must be given, if
possible, to every word, clause and sentence of a statute.

In our view the statute indicates an intention on the part of the
Legislature to extend criminal responsibility beyond that imposed upon a
felon at common law and to hold liable all participants in an armed
robbery for deaths which occur during the commission of the crime.

It is clearly the majority view throughout the country that, at least in
theory, the doctrine of felony murder does not extend to a killing,
although growing out of the commission of the felony, if directly
attributable to the act of one other than the defendant or those
associated with him in the unlawful enterprise. This rule is sometimes
rationalized on the \"agency\" theory of felony murder.

A contrary view, which would attach liability under the felony murder
rule for any death proximately resulting from the unlawful activity --
even the death of a co-felon -- notwithstanding the killing was by one
resisting the crime, does not seem to have the present allegiance of any
court.

To be distinguished from the situation before us here, and from the
generality of the cases discussed above, are the so-called \"shield\"
cases. The first of these were the companion cases of *Taylor v. State*,
41 Tex. Cr. R. 564, (Cr. App. 1900). In attempting to escape after
robbing a train, defendants thrust the brakeman in front of them as a
shield, as a result of which he was fatally shot by law officers. The
court had no difficulty in finding defendants guilty of murder. The
court in Taylor noted the correctness of the Campbell case doctrine that
a person could not be held liable for homicide unless the act is either
actually or constructively committed by him, but indicated it was
inapplicable to a case where defendants forced deceased to occupy a
place of danger in order that they might carry out the crime. The
conduct of the defendants in cases such as these is said to reflect
\"express malice,\" justifying a murder conviction.

Reverting to our immediate task here, it is to determine whether our own
statute necessarily mandates the proximate cause concept of felony
murder, as thought by the Appellate Division majority. It is fair to
assume, initially, that the Legislature had no special reason in 1796 to
ordain a rule of felony murder beyond that generally accepted in
Anglo-American jurisprudence at the end of the eighteenth century. As
above noted, there was then no precedent, either English or American,
for holding the felon for killings at the hands of others than the felon
himself or those confederated with him -- that is to say, the so-called
agency rule held sway. But as seen above, the view of the Appellate
Division was that the \"ensues clause\" of N.J.S.A. 2A:113-1 must be
deemed to have expanded the culpability of the felon to killings by
others not confederated with him, if proximately related to the
felonious enterprise, else the clause would be meaningless surplusage in
the act. However, other plausible motivations for the ensues clause can
be postulated consistent with a legislative intent to adhere to the
traditional limitations of the felony murder doctrine.

With such background, and assuming the statute is facially susceptible
of the interpretation here advocated by the State, it is appropriate to
consider the public policy implications of the proposed doctrine as an
extension of prior assumptions in this State as to the proper
limitations of the felony murder rule.

Most modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors
restriction rather than expansion of the felony murder rule. A leading
text states: \"The felony murder rule is somewhat in disfavor at the
present time. The courts apply it when the law requires, but they do so
grudgingly and tend to restrict its application where the circumstances
permit.\" It has frequently been observed that although the rule was
logical at its inception, when all felonies were punishable by death,
its survival to modern times when other felonies are not thought to be
as blameworthy as premeditated killings is discordant with rational and
enlightened views of criminal culpability and liability.

\[I\]t appears to us regressive to extend the application of the felony
murder rule beyond its classic common-law limitation to acts by the
felon and his accomplices, to lethal acts of third persons not in
furtherance of the felonious scheme. The language of the statute does
not compel it, and, as indicated above, is entirely compatible with the
traditional limitations of the rule. Tort concepts of foreseeability and
proximate cause have shallow relevance to culpability for murder in the
first degree. Gradations of criminal liability should accord with degree
of moral culpability for the actor\'s conduct.

It is our judgment that if the course of the law as understood and
applied in this State for almost 200 years is to be altered so
drastically, it should be by express legislative enactment.

The judgment of the Appellate Division is modified so as to strike the
conviction and sentencing of defendant for murder of the co-felon
Lloredo.

SULLIVAN, J. (concurring in result only).

The practical result of the majority holding is that even though some
innocent person or a police officer be killed during the commission of
an armed robbery, the felon would bear no criminal responsibility of any
kind for that killing as long as it was not at the hand of the felon or
a confederate. The legislative intent, as I see it, is otherwise.

The thrust of our felony murder statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:113-1, is to hold
the criminal liable for any killing which ensues during the commission
of a felony, even though the felon, or a confederate, did not commit the
actual killing. The only exception I would recognize would be the death
of a co-felon, which could be classified as a justifiable homicide and
not within the purview of the statute.

The Legislature should act promptly to clarify the situation resulting
from the majority opinion. If it does not extend the felony murder
statute to encompass a killing during the commission of a felony not at
the hand of the felon or confederate, it should, at least, provide that
the felon be chargeable with manslaughter for such killing (in addition
to liability for the felony).

I, therefore, concur in the result but only for the reason stated above.

People v. Washington

 

### *People v. Washington*

Supreme Court of California

44 Cal.Rptr. 442 (1965)

 

TRAYNOR, Chief Justice.

Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction entered upon jury
verdicts finding him guilty of first degree robbery and first degree
murder and fixing the murder penalty at life imprisonment. He was
convicted of murder for participating in a robbery in which his
accomplice was killed by the victim of the robbery.

Shortly before 10 p. m., October 2, 1962, Johnnie Carpenter prepared to
close his gasoline station. He was in his office computing the receipts
and disbursements of the day while an attendant in an adjacent storage
room deposited money in a vault. Upon hearing someone yell \'robbery,\'
Carpenter opened his desk and took out a revolver. A few moments later,
James Ball entered the office and pointed a revolver directly at
Carpenter, who fired immediately, mortally wounding Ball. Carpenter then
hurried to the door and saw an unarmed man he later identified as
defendant running from the vault with a moneybag in his right hand. He
shouted \'Stop.\' When his warning was not heeded, he fired and hit
defendant who fell wounded in front of the station.

The Attorney General, relying on *People v. Harrison*, Cal.App.2d 330,
contends that defendant was properly convicted of first degree murder.
In that case defendants initiated a gun battle with an employee in an
attempt to rob a cleaning business. In the cross fire, the employee
accidentally killed the owner of the business. The court affirmed the
judgment convicting defendants of first degree murder, invoking
*Commonwealth v. Almeida*, 362 Pa. 596, and *People v. Podolski*, 332
Mich. 508 which held that robbers who provoked gunfire were guilty of
first degree murder even though the lethal bullet was fired by a
policeman.

Defendant would distinguish the *Harrison*, *Almeida*, and *Podolski*
cases on the ground that in each instance the person killed was an
innocent victim, not one of the felons. He suggests that we limit the
rule of the *Harrison* case just as the Supreme Courts of Pennsylvania
and Michigan have limited the *Almeida* and *Podolski* cases by holding
that surviving felons are not guilty of murder when their accomplices
are killed by persons resisting the felony. A distinction based on the
person killed, however, would make the defendant\'s criminal liability
turn upon the marksmanship of victims and policemen. A rule of law
cannot reasonably be based on such a fortuitous circumstance. The basic
issue therefore is whether a robber can be convicted of murder for the
killing of any person by another who is resisting the robbery.

\'Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, with malice
aforethought.\' Except when the common-law-felony-murder doctrine is
applicable, an essential element of murder is an intent to kill or an
intent with conscious disregard for life to commit acts likely to kill.
The felony-murder doctrine ascribes malice aforethought to the felon who
kills in the perpetration of an inherently dangerous felony. That
doctrine is incorporated in section 189 of the Penal Code, which
provides in part: \'All murder . . . committed in the perpetration or
attempt to perpetrate . . . robbery . . . is murder of the first
degree.\' Thus, even though section 189 speaks only of degrees of
\'murder,\' inadvertent or accidental killings are first degree murders
when committed by felons in the perpetration of robbery.

When a killing is not committed by a robber or by his accomplice but by
his victim, malice aforethought is not attributable to the robber, for
the killing is not committed by him in the perpetration or attempt to
perpetrate robbery. It is not enough that the killing was a risk
reasonably to be foreseen and that the robbery might therefore be
regarded as a proximate cause of the killing. Section 189 requires that
the felon or his accomplice commit the killing, for if he does not, the
killing is not committed to perpetrate the felony. Indeed, in the
present case the killing was committed to thwart a felony. To include
such killings within section 189 would expand the meaning of the words
\'murder . . . which is committed in the perpetration . . . (of) robbery
. . . \' beyond common understanding.

The purpose of the felony-murder rule is to deter felons from killing
negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly responsible for
killings they commit. This purpose is not served by punishing them for
killings committed by their victims.

It is contended, however, that another purpose of the felony-murder rule
is to prevent the commission of robberies. Neither the common-law
rationale of the rule nor the Penal Code supports this contention. In
every robbery there is a possibility that the victim will resist and
kill. The robber has little control over such a killing once the robbery
is undertaken as this case demonstrates. To impose an additional penalty
for the killing would discriminate between robbers, not on the basis of
any difference in their own conduct, but solely on the basis of the
response by others that the robber\'s conduct happened to induce. An
additional penalty for a homicide committed by the victim would deter
robbery haphazardly at best. To \'prevent stealing, (the law) would do
better to hang one thief in every thousand by lot.\'

A defendant need not do the killing himself, however, to be guilty of
murder. He may be vicariously responsible under the rules defining
principals and criminal conspiracies. All persons aiding and abetting
the commission of a robbery are guilty of first degree murder when one
of them kills while acting in furtherance of the common design.
Moreover, when the defendant intends to kill or intentionally commits
acts that are likely to kill with a conscious disregard for life, he is
guilty of murder even though he uses another person to accomplish his
objective.

Defendants who initiate gun battles may also be found guilty of murder
if their victims resist and kill. Under such circumstances, \'the
defendant for a base, anti-social motive and with wanton disregard for
human life, does an act that involves a high degree of probability that
it will result in death,\'  and it is unnecessary to imply malice by
invoking the felony-murder doctrine. To invoke the felony-murder
doctrine to imply malice in such a case is unnecessary and overlooks the
principles of criminal liability that should govern the responsibility
of one person for a killing committed by another.

To invoke the felony-murder doctrine when the killing is not committed
by the defendant or by his accomplice could lead to absurd results.
Thus, two men rob a grocery store and flee in opposite directions. The
owner of the store follows one of the robbers and kills him. Neither
robber may have fired a shot. Neither robber may have been armed with a
deadly weapon. If the felony-murder doctrine applied, however, the
surviving robber could be convicted of first degree murder, even though
he was captured by a policeman and placed under arrest at the time his
accomplice was killed.

The felony-murder rule has been criticized on the grounds that in almost
all cases in which it is applied it is unnecessary and that it erodes
the relation between criminal liability and moral culpability. Although
it is the law in this state (Pen.Code, § 189), it should not be extended
beyond any rational function that it is designed to serve. Accordingly,
for a defendant to be guilty of murder under the felony-murder rule the
act of killing must be committed by the defendant or by his accomplice
acting in furtherance of their common design.

### *King v. Commonwealth*

Court of Appeals of Virginia

368 S.E.2d 704 (Va. Ct. App. 1988)

 

COLEMAN, J.

On October 17, 1984, King and his copilot, Mark Lee Bailey, were flying
a Beechcraft Bonanza airplane carrying over five hundred pounds of
marijuana to the New River Valley airport in Dublin, Virginia. They were
flying for Wallace Thrasher, who owned the airplane and ran the drug
smuggling operation. King was a licensed pilot; Bailey was not. The two
encountered heavy cloud cover and fog near Mt. Airy, North Carolina and
apparently became lost. In an effort to navigate through the cloud cover
and fog, they flew the plane to a lower altitude in order to follow U.S.
Route 52. Bailey was piloting the plane at this time. As Bailey flew,
King was examining navigation maps in an attempt to determine the
plane\'s whereabouts. The airplane crashed into Fancy Gap Mountain
killing Bailey almost instantly. King was thrown from the plane and
survived. King was charged with felony homicide under Code Sec. 18.2-33
for Bailey\'s death. A jury convicted King of second degree murder under
the statute and recommended a six-year penitentiary sentence.

Code Sec. 18.2-33 defines second degree felony homicide: \"The killing
of one accidentally, contrary to the intention of the parties, while in
the prosecution of some felonious act other than those specified in
Sections 18.2-31 and 18.2-32, is murder of the second degree and is
punishable as a Class 3 felony.\" This statute and its companion, Sec.
18.2-32, defining first degree felony-murder, codify the common law
doctrine of felony-murder. The doctrine was developed to elevate to
murder a homicide committed during the course of a felony by imputing
malice to the killing. The justification for imputing malice was the
theory that the increased risk of death or serious harm occasioned by
the commission of a felony demonstrated the felon\'s lack of concern for
human life. The doctrine was originally limited, therefore, to felonies
that were inherently or foreseeably dangerous. The purpose of the
doctrine was to deter inherently dangerous felonies by holding the
felons responsible for the consequences of the felony, whether intended
or not. While the range of felonies which may be a predicate for the
felony-murder conviction has changed, the function of the doctrine is
still to elevate to murder a homicide resulting from a felony by
imputing malice.

Criminal statutes are to be \"strictly construed against the
Commonwealth and in favor of \[a\] citizen\'s liberty." Strict
construction, however, does not justify nullification of the evident
purpose and meaning of a statute. A penal statute must be construed so
as to proscribe only conduct which the legislature clearly intended to
be within the statute\'s ambit.

The second degree felony-murder statute in Virginia contemplates a
killing with malice. Indeed, \"the commission of any felonious act . . .
supplies the malice which raises the incidental homicide to the level of
second-degree murder.\" It does not follow, however, that any death of
any person which occurs during the period in which a felony is being
committed will subject the felon to criminal liability under the
felony-murder rule. To construe our statute to encompass every
accidental death occurring during the commission of a felony, regardless
of whether it causally relates to or results from the commission of the
felony, is to make felons absolutely liable for the accidental death of
another even though such death is fortuitous and the product of causes
wholly unrelated to the commission of the felony. Recognizing the
potentially harsh and far-reaching effects of such a construction of the
felony-murder doctrine, the Virginia courts, as well as others, have
limited its application. In order for the incidental accidental killing
to be murder, the homicide must be criminal in nature and must contain
the elements or attributes of criminal homicide cognizable at common
law.

One of the most significant factors in defining the scope of the
felony-murder doctrine involves the causation required between the
felony and the death. Previous decisions of the Virginia Supreme Court
have found it unnecessary to decide whether \"a mere nexus\" between the
death and predicate felony is sufficient to satisfy the statute or
whether a more direct causal relationship is required. We must address
that issue at this time.

In Virginia, it is clear when the homicide is within the res gestae of
the initial felony and emanates therefrom, it is committed in the
perpetration of that felony. *Haskell v. Commonwealth*, 243 S.E.2d 477,
482 (1978). The Court explained that \"the felony-murder statute applies
where the killing is so closely related to the felony in time, place,
and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal
enterprise.\" Thus, the court in *Haskell* affirmed first degree murder
convictions when the murder of a robbery victim was within five feet of
the site of the robbery, within moments of the robbery, and was to
facilitate the robbers\' escape without being identified. Under these
circumstances, the killing was obviously causally related to the robbery
and was part of the same enterprise. The Court did not elaborate on the
degree of causal connection required under the statute.

In a more recent case, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed a conviction
under the felony-murder rule when a death by cocaine overdose was
charged to the person who distributed the cocaine. *Heacock*, 228 Va. at
401-02, 323 S.E.2d at 92-93. In that circumstance, the court declined to
address whether the felony-murder rule required a showing of causal
relationship flowing from the felony to the homicide or whether a \"mere
nexus\" would suffice because the death was a direct result of the
felony of distribution of cocaine.

In a leading case involving the felony-murder doctrine, which the
Virginia Supreme Court has cited with approval, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court addressed the causation problem at length. Rejecting their
previous standard of proximate cause, the court stated:

In adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times that
the thing which is imputed to a felon for a killing incidental to his
felony is malice and not the act of killing. The mere coincidence of
homicide and felony is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the
felony-murder doctrine. . . .\" Death must be a consequence of the
felony . . . and not merely coincidence.\"

*Commonwealth v. Redline*, 137A.2d 472, 476 (1958) (citations omitted).
The court noted further: \"\[T\]he \`causation\' requirement for
responsibility in a felony-murder is that the homicide stem from the
commission of the felony." The *Redline* court noted that the malice of
the underlying felony attaches to whatever else the criminal may do in
connection with the felony. Therefore, \"the killing must have been done
by the defendant or by an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in
furtherance of the felonious undertaking.\"

The implications of this reasoning are threefold. First, only acts
causing death which are committed by those involved in the felony can be
the basis for a conviction. Second, the act causing death must result
from some effort to further the felony before malice can be imputed to
that act. Third, there must be some act attributable to the felons which
causes death. It is not sufficient that death be only temporally related
to commission of the felony. Death must be directly related in time,
place, and causal connection to the commission of the felony; the felony
or acts in furtherance thereof must contribute to cause the death to
constitute a \"killing\" within the felony-murder statute.

In the present case, King and Bailey were in the airplane to further the
felony of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute. They
were flying over the mountains while committing the felony. The time and
the place of the death were closely connected with the felony. However,
no causal connection exists between the felony of drug distribution and
the killing by a plane crash. Thus, no basis exists to find that the
accidental death was part or a result of the criminal enterprise. In the
felony-murder cases cited above, death, to be considered an \"accidental
killing\" within the statute, has resulted from a particular act which
was an integral part of the felony or an act in direct furtherance of
the felony --- shooting a gun, striking a match, distributing cocaine.
In this case, there is no such act which caused the death. Thus, there
has been no homicide, or unlawful killing by another, for which a
co-felon can be held accountable. Bailey, who was flying the plane at
the time of the crash, was not killed by King or by any act of King
which was in furtherance of the felony. We see no \"act of killing\"
which we can attribute to King or to the felony. The felony-murder rule
does not exist to enable courts to impute \"the act of killing\" where
an accidental death results from fortuitous circumstances and the only
connection with the felony is temporal. The cause of Bailey\'s death was
Bailey\'s piloting and adverse weather conditions. The accident stemmed
not from the possession or distribution of drugs, but from fog, low
cloud cover, pilot error, and inexperience. Had Bailey and King been
transporting drugs in an automobile when they encountered heavy fog and
Bailey, not seeing a curve, had driven off the mountain, the legal
consequences would be the same. The commission of the felony merely
accounted for their presence at the location of the accident, and
nothing directly related to the commission of the felony caused the
accident. Thus, flying into the mountain was not a direct consequence of
the felony. Had the plane been flying low or recklessly to avoid
detection, for example, the crash would be a consequence or action which
was directly intended to further the felony and a different result might
obtain.

Reversed and dismissed.

Homicide Summary

 

Amended Colorado Homicide Statute

 

In 2021 the Colorado general assembly made significant changes to the
homicide statute. What is different in the new statute, set forth below?
Are there significant problems with the statute that remain unaddressed?

 

18-3-102 Murder in the First Degree

(1) A person commits the crime of murder in the first degree if:

(a) After deliberation and with the intent to cause the death of a
person other than himself, he causes the death of that person or of
another person; or

(b) Repealed.

(c) By perjury or subornation of perjury he procures the conviction and
execution of any innocent person; or

(d) Under circumstances evidencing an attitude of universal malice
manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life generally,
he knowingly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to a
person, or persons, other than himself, and thereby causes the death of
another; or

(e) He or she commits unlawful distribution, dispensation, or sale of a
controlled substance to a person under the age of eighteen years on
school grounds as provided in section 18-18-407(2),
or 18-18-407(1)(g)(I) for offenses committed on or after October 1,
2013, and the death of such person is caused by the use of such
controlled substance; or

(f) The person knowingly causes the death of a child who has not yet
attained twelve years of age and the person committing the offense is
one in a position of trust with respect to the victim.

 

18-3-103 Murder in the Second Degree

(1) A person commits the crime of murder in the second degree if:

(a) The person knowingly causes the death of a person; or

(b) Acting either alone or with one or more persons, he or she commits
or attempts to commit felony arson, robbery, burglary, kidnapping,
sexual assault as prohibited by section 18-3-402, sexual assault in the
first or second degree as prohibited by section 18-3-402 or 18-3-403, as
those sections existed prior to July 1, 2000, or a class 3 felony for
sexual assault on a child as provided in section 18-3-405(2), or the
felony crime of escape as provided in section 18-8-208, and, in the
course of or in furtherance of the crime that he or she is committing or
attempting to commit, or of immediate flight therefrom, the death of a
person, other than one of the participants, is caused by any
participant.

(1.5) It is an affirmative defense to a charge of violating subsection
(1)(b) of this section that the defendant:

(a) Was not the only participant in the underlying crime; and

(b) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request,
command, importune, cause, or aid the commission thereof; and

(c) Was not armed with a deadly weapon; and

\(d\) Did not engage himself or herself in or intend to engage in and
had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended
to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious bodily injury.

\(2\) Diminished responsibility due to self-induced intoxication is not
a defense to murder in the second degree.

\(3\)

(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection
(3), murder in the second degree is a class 2 felony.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection
(3), murder in the second degree is a class 3 felony where the act
causing the death was performed upon a sudden heat of passion, caused by
a serious and highly provoking act of the intended victim, affecting the
defendant sufficiently to excite an irresistible passion in a reasonable
person; but, if between the provocation and the killing there is an
interval sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard,
the killing is a class 2 felony.

(c) For purposes of determining sudden heat of passion pursuant to
subsection (3)(b) of this section, a defendant\'s act does not
constitute an act performed upon a sudden heat of passion if it results
solely from the discovery of, knowledge about, or potential disclosure
of the victim\'s actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender
expression, or sexual orientation, including but not limited to under
circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible romantic
or sexual advance toward the defendant.

(a) Such person recklessly causes the death of another person; or

\(b\) Such person intentionally causes or aids another person to commit
suicide.

\(2\) Manslaughter is a class 4 felony.

(3) This section shall not apply to a person, including a proxy
decision-maker as such person is described in section 15-18.5-103,
C.R.S., who complies with any advance medical directive in accordance

ill patient with the consent of the terminally ill patient or his or her
agent.

18-3-105 Criminally Negligent Homicide

Any person who causes the death of another person by conduct amounting
to criminal negligence commits criminally negligent homicide which is a
class 5 felony.

18-3-106 Vehicular Homicide

\(1\)

(a) If a person operates or drives a motor vehicle in a reckless manner,
and such conduct is the proximate cause of the death of another, such
person commits vehicular homicide.

\(b\)

(I) If a person operates or drives a motor vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol or one or more drugs, or a combination of both
alcohol and one or more drugs, and such conduct is the proximate cause
of the death of another, such person commits vehicular homicide. This is
a strict liability crime.

 

 

 

3.5

The Death Penalty

 

Capital punishment has driven the evolution of homicide law in the
United States for centuries. Throughout that evolution, questions of
fairness and arbitrariness have recurred. Because the death penalty was
originally mandatory for murder, states began differentiating between
first and second degree murder, limiting capital punishment only to the
former, more blameworthy crime. As capital punishment gradually became
more discretionary, the opposite concern arose: that it would be imposed
unevenly and disproportionately to certain defendants, especially
minorities. At one point, the Supreme Court suspended the capital
punishment system altogether in *Furman v. Georgia*. Today, many capital
punishment systems attempt to straddle the line: allowing discretion,
but not unguided discretion. In some jurisdictions the death penalty has
been eliminated. In others, it has been cabined to only the most heinous
murders. Ironically, the growing sophistication of capital punishment
systems that developed as a response to Supreme Court nullification of
death penalty laws has led to a resurgence of executions. As you read
these cases, consider why the death penalty has driven such changes in
our criminal adjudication system, and what concerns courts have raised
about the application of capital punishment. Have reforms reinstating
the death penalty solved the problems the Supreme Court identified? How
do concerns about the death penalty fit into the justifications and
problems of criminal punishment more generally?

4.2

Sex Assault Law Overview

 

Rape Law in the United States

Rape has historically been treated as one of the most serious offenses
in the criminal code. Until the Supreme Court's decision in *Coker v.
Georgia*, 433 U.S. 584 (1977), rape was punishable, and often punished,
by death. The use of the death penalty for rape was a tool often used in
the South to terrorize and "legally" lynch black men for the alleged
rape of white women. The most famous such example is the so-called
Scottsboro Boys case -- although there was little evidence that any
crime had been committed, eight teenage boys were sentenced to death for
the rape of two white women on board a train. The last of these death
sentences took decades to overturn.\[1\] This sorry racial history no
doubt influenced the Court's decision to strike down the death penalty
for rape.

Traditionally, rape was defined as a crime of physical violence. For
example, the Maryland statute discussed in the classic case of *State v.
Rusk,* 289 Md. 230 (1981) defined the crime as follows:

A person is guilty of rape in the second degree if the person engages in
vaginal intercourse with another person by force or threat of force
against the will and without the consent of the other person.

That Maryland statute is typical of the traditional approach in its
focus on physical indicia -- in this case force or threat of force -- to
prove the presence or absence of consent on the part of the victim.
Other states required a demonstration that the victim had resisted the
sex act physically before that act could be deemed to be rape. For
example, the California Penal Code long required either that the victim
resist or that they were "prevented from resisting by threats of great
and immediate bodily harm." During this period sex without consent was
not defined as rape and often was not punished criminally at all in the
absence of proof of either force or resistance.

Over time, however, there was a growing recognition among both courts
and legislatures that the harms of rape often have more to do with
deprivation of the victim's autonomy than with assault and battery. For
the first time, the absence of consent alone was deemed sufficient to
make intercourse criminal. Force and violence became aggravating factors
rather than elements of the crime of rape. Rape, which originally was a
single, very serious crime, splintered into several different offenses,
with the punishments keyed to whether the defendant used force, whether
a weapon was present, or whether serious injury resulted from the
defendant's conduct. Colorado law follows this approach.

Typical of this trend toward recognizing non-consensual sex as criminal
is the statute the New Jersey legislature in 1978 which focused
exclusively on consent rather than force and resistance. As the New
Jersey high court described the statute in State in *Interest of MTS*,
129 N.J.  422 (1992):

\[A\]ny act of sexual penetration engaged in by the defendant without
the affirmative and freely-given permission of the victim to the
specific act of penetration constitutes the offense of sexual assault.
Therefore, physical force in excess of that inherent in the act of
sexual penetration is not required for such penetration to be unlawful.
The definition of \"physical force\" is satisfied ... if the defendant
applies any amount of force against another person in the absence of
what a reasonable person would believe to be affirmative and
freely-given permission to the act of sexual penetration.

As rape statutes such as this one came to emphasize consent rather than
force or resistance, the mens rea of the defendant with regard to
consent became more of a determining factor in rape prosecutions. When
the state had been required to demonstrate that the defendant used
physical force to overcome resistance, the defendant's mens rea with
regard to consent was rarely in doubt. When the question became solely
or primarily whether the person with whom the defendant had sex had
consented to that conduct, claims of mistake and ignorance became both
more common and more salient, raising the question of what, if any, mens
rea a defendant must have with regard to consent in order to be guilty
of rape.

In *MTS*, the Court implicitly announced a negligence standard. A
defendant is guilty of sexual assault under New Jersey law when he
engages in sexual intercourse in the absence of what a reasonable person
would believe is affirmative and freely given consent. In other words
the mental state set forth by statute is the failure to perceive that
the victim was not consenting when a reasonable person would have -- the
definition of negligence with regard to consent.

The majority of US jurisdictions today probably require recklessness
with regard to consent, but some have imposed strict liability as is
often imposed in sex offenses involving minors. For example, in
*Commonwealth v. Lopez*, 433 Mass. 722 (2001) the Massachusetts Supreme
Court held that:

A mistake of fact as to consent... has very little application to our
rape statute. Because \[the statute\] does not require proof of a
defendant\'s knowledge of the victim\'s lack of consent or intent to
engage in nonconsensual intercourse as a material element of the
offense, a mistake as to that consent cannot, therefore, negate a mental
state required for commission of the prohibited conduct. Any perception
(reasonable, honest, or otherwise) of the defendant as to the victim\'s
consent is consequently not relevant to a rape prosecution.

The situation in Massachusetts is thus that one may be convicted of rape
if he incorrectly, though reasonably, believes that the person with whom
he had sex consented to that conduct. Of course, the jury must still
find that the victim did not in fact consent, and in the absence of
objective indicia of lack of consent, a jury might choose not to convict
the defendant.

Rape prosecutions often raise complicated questions of evidence and
proof as well. As the focus moved away from force and resistance toward
consent and mistake, defendants were left with little alternative than
to show that the purported victim was a willing participant in the
alleged acts or at least that it was reasonable for the defendant to
believe that was true. Often, criminal defendants seek to do so by
placing into evidence the victim's past sexual behavior, whether with
the defendant or with others. Although such evidence might be narrowly
relevant under the traditional formulation of evidence law -- whether
the proffered fact makes it more likely that the victim consented on the
occasion in question -- such testimony is generally barred in a rape
prosecution. Legislatures have generally decided that those alleging
sexual assault should have their past sexual activity deemed
inadmissible. Otherwise, the reasoning goes, fear of embarrassment or
intimidation will prevent meritorious claims from being brought forward
by victims. Relatedly, it is generally impermissible to introduce the
defendant's prior bad acts in order to prove that he acted in violation
of the law on a later occasion. Thus, it is generally impermissible to
introduce other allegations of sexual assault in a later prosecution for
fear that the jury will judge the defendant based on his reputation
rather than his conduct on a particular occasion.

The Significance of Resulting Harm

 

We have already seen with homicide that it matters very much if
particular harm results from the defendant\'s conduct: Speeding is a
traffic infraction; speeding that causes death is homicide. But why
should that be? In this section we use two topics \-- causation and
attempt \-- to investigate the question of why the criminal law places
such a high degree of importance on whether or not the defendant\'s
culpable conduct results in tangible harm.

 

 

 

 

5.1

Causation

 

Not every crime requires that the defendant cause a particular harm.
Burglary is breaking and entering at night with the intent to commit a
felony. But some crimes \-- principally homicide \-- require that the
defendant cause a particular harm. In many of these cases, causation is
easily shown; for example, the defendant stabbed or shot the victim and
the victim died. In the ones below, we consider harder cases, where the
link between the defendant\'s conduct and the victim\'s harm is more
attenuated.

 

 

 

 

5.1.1

But For and Proximate Cause

 

In this section we examine the traditional test for causation \-- that
the defendant be both the but-for cause of the charged harm and that the
harm proximately (or foreseeably) resulted from her conduct. As we shall
se the latter question is really little more than a judgment that it is
fair to hold this defendant responsible for causing this harm. The Model
Penal Code approach simply makes this explicit.

 

 

 

 

5.1.1.1

People v. Acosta

 

### *People v. Acosta*

California Court of Appeals

284 Cal. App.3d 1375 (1991)

 

At 10 p.m. on March 10, 1987, Officers Salceda and Francis of the Santa
Ana Police Department\'s automobile theft detail saw Acosta in Elvira
Salazar\'s stolen Nissan Pulsar parked on the street. The officers
approached Acosta and identified themselves. Acosta inched the Pulsar
forward, then accelerated rapidly. He led Salceda, Francis and officers
from other agencies on a 48--mile chase along numerous surface streets
and freeways throughout Orange County. The chase ended near Acosta\'s
residence in Anaheim.

During the chase, Acosta engaged in some of the most egregious driving
tactics imaginable. He ran stop signs and red lights, and drove on the
wrong side of streets, causing oncoming traffic to scatter or swerve to
avoid colliding with him. Once, when all traffic lanes were blocked by
vehicles stopped for a red light, he used a dirt shoulder to circumvent
stationary vehicles and pass through the intersection. When leaving the
freeway in Anaheim, he drove over a cement shoulder.

Throughout the pursuit, Acosta weaved in and out of traffic, cutting in
front of other cars and causing them to brake suddenly. At one point on
the freeway, he crossed three lanes of traffic, struck another car,
jumped the divider between the freeway and a transition lane, and passed
a tanker truck, forcing it to swerve suddenly to avoid a collision.

Acosta generally drove at speeds between 60 and 90 miles per hour,
slowing only when necessary. During several turns, his wheels lost
traction. When an officer was able to drive parallel to the Pulsar for a
short distance, Acosta looked in his direction and smiled. Near the end
of the chase, one of the Pulsar\'s front tires blew out, but Acosta
continued to drive at 55 to 60 miles per hour, crossing freeway traffic
lanes.

Police helicopters from Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, and
Newport Beach assisted in the chase by tracking Acosta. During the early
part of the pursuit, the Costa Mesa and Newport Beach craft were used,
pinpointing Acosta\'s location with their high beam spotlights. The
Costa Mesa helicopter was leading the pursuit, in front of and below the
Newport Beach helicopter. As they flew into Newport Beach, the pilots
agreed the Newport Beach craft should take the lead. The normal
procedure for such a maneuver is for the lead helicopter to move to the
right and swing around clockwise behind the other craft while climbing
to an altitude of 1,000 feet. At the same time, the trailing helicopter
descends to 500 feet while maintaining a straight course.

At the direction of the Costa Mesa pilot, the Newport Beach helicopter
moved forward and descended while the Costa Mesa helicopter banked to
the right. Shortly after commencing this procedure, the Costa Mesa
helicopter, having terminated radio communication, came up under the
Newport Beach helicopter from the right rear and collided with it. Both
helicopters fell to the ground. Three occupants in the Costa Mesa
helicopter died as a result of the crash.

Menzies Turner, a retired Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
investigator, testified as an expert and concluded the accident occurred
because the Costa Mesa helicopter, the faster of the two aircraft, made
a 360--degree turn and closed too rapidly on the Newport Beach
helicopter. He opined the Costa Mesa helicopter\'s pilot violated an FAA
regulation prohibiting careless and reckless operation of an aircraft by
failing to properly clear the area, not maintaining communication with
the Newport Beach helicopter, failing to keep the other aircraft in view
at all times, and not changing his altitude. He also testified the Costa
Mesa pilot violated another FAA regulation prohibiting operation of one
aircraft so close to another as to create a collision hazard.2

Turner could not think of any reason for the Costa Mesa helicopter\'s
erratic movement. The maneuver was not a difficult one, and was not
affected by the ground activity at the time. He had never heard of a
midair collision between two police helicopters involved in tracking a
ground pursuit, and had never investigated a midair collision involving
helicopters.

After his arrest Acosta told the police he knew the Pulsar was stolen
and he fled the police to avoid arrest. He also saw two helicopters with
spotlights, and turned off the Pulsar\'s lights to evade them. Acosta
knew that his flight was dangerous "to the bone," but he tried to warn
other cars by flashing the car lights and by otherwise being "as safe as
possible."

Acosta claims there was insufficient evidence of two elements necessary
to support the convictions for second degree murder: that he proximately
caused the deaths of the victims, and that his state of mind constituted
implied malice. He is correct on the latter claim.

As to the proximate cause issue, Acosta argues that although a collision
between ground vehicles was a foreseeable result of his conduct, one
between airborne helicopters was not, noting his expert had never heard
of a similar incident. He also contends the Costa Mesa helicopter
pilot\'s violation of FAA regulations was a superseding cause. Because
the deaths here were unusual, to say the least, the issue deserves
special scrutiny.

"Proximate cause" is the term historically used to separate those
results for which an actor will be held responsible from those not
carrying such responsibility. The term is, in a sense, artificial,
serving matters of policy surrounding tort and criminal law and based
partly on expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice.
Because such concerns are sometimes more a matter of "common sense" than
pure logic, the line of demarcation is flexible, and attempts to lay
down uniform tests which apply evenly in all situations have failed.
That does not mean general guidelines and approaches to analysis cannot
be constructed.

The threshold question in examining causation is whether the
defendant\'s act was an "actual cause" of the victim\'s injury. It is a
sine qua non test: But for the defendant\'s act would the injury have
occurred? Unless an act is an actual cause of the injury, it will not be
considered a proximate cause.

The next inquiry is whether the defendant\'s act was a "substantial
factor" in the injury. In California, the substantial factor issue has
arisen most often where multiple causes act concurrently, but
independently, to produce the harm. The test is one of exclusion only. 
Unless a cause is a substantial factor in the harm it will not be
considered a proximate cause, but some substantial factor causes may not
be deemed proximate causes.

\[The Court then focused on California cases which held that proximate
cause often boils down to the question of foreseeability.\]

*Prosser* and *Keeton*, in an in-depth discussion of the dynamics of
foresight, conclude that although it is desirable to exclude extremely
remarkable and unusual results from the purview of proximate cause, it
is virtually impossible to express a logical verbal formula which will
produce uniform results. I agree. The standard should be simply stated,
exclude extraordinary results, and allow the trier of fact to determine
the issue on the particular facts of the case using "the common sense of
the common man as to common things." As with other ultimate issues,
appellate courts must review that determination, giving due deference to
the trier of fact.

The "highly extraordinary result" standard serves that purpose. It is
consistent with the definition of foreseeability used in California. It
does not involve the defendant\'s state of mind, but focuses upon the
objective conditions present when he acts. Like numerous other legal
definitions, what it means in practice will be determined as case law
develops. Limitations arising from the mental state of the actor can be
left to concepts like malice, recklessness and negligence.

Because the highly extraordinary result standard is consistent with the
limitation on direct causes, it simplifies the proximate cause inquiry.
The analysis is: (1) was the defendant\'s conduct the actual cause of
the harm (but for his actions would it have occurred as it did)? (2) was
the result an intended consequence of the act? (3) was the defendant\'s
action a substantial factor in the harm? and (4) was the result highly
extraordinary in light of the circumstances?

If the first question is answered no, proximate cause is lacking. If
answered yes, the next question must be examined. If the second question
is answered yes, proximate cause is established. If answered no, the
next question must be examined. If the third question is answered no,
proximate cause is lacking. If answered yes, proximate cause is
established unless the fourth question is answered yes, in which case it
is lacking. The analysis does away with the need to consider the
distinction between direct, concurrent, contributory, and dependent and
independent intervening causes. It focuses, as it should, upon the role
the defendant\'s act played in the harm, limiting culpability only where
the conduct was de minimis or the result highly extraordinary.

Here, but for Acosta\'s conduct of fleeing the police, the helicopters
would never have been in position for the crash. However, there was no
evidence he intended the harm, so I must examine questions three and
four.

Although an extremely close question, Acosta\'s conduct was a
substantial factor in causing the crash. He was fleeing when the
accident occurred, and there was no lapse of time between his flight and
the crash---his action had not "come to rest." The only other factor
operating at the time was the improper flight pattern of the Costa Mesa
pilot. Although Acosta\'s horrendous driving did not cause the
helicopter\'s improper maneuver, his flight undoubtedly infused
excitement and tension into the situation, which can be considered to be
a substantial factor. No similar case has held otherwise, although the
third party collisions all have involved accidents on the ground.

The result was not highly extraordinary. Although a two-helicopter
collision was unknown to expert witness Turner and no reported cases
describe one, it was "a possible consequence which reasonably might have
been contemplated." Given the emotional dynamics of any police pursuit,
there is an "appreciable probability" that one of the pursuers, in the
heat of the chase, may act negligently or recklessly to catch the
quarry. That no pursuits have ever before resulted in a helicopter crash
or midair collision is more a comment on police flying skill and
technology than upon the innate probabilities involved.

\[The Court next concluded that, although Acosta was the legal cause of
the crash, the murder conviction could not be sustained. "\[T\]here is
no evidence Acosta had a conscious disregard for any risk to the
helicopters. Although he stated he knew his conduct was dangerous "to
the bone," nothing connected the statement to the aerial surveillance.
His knowledge that there were helicopters involved in the pursuit does
not suffice. In the absence of more evidence, no reasonable juror could
find a conscious disregard for a risk which is barely objectively
cognizable."\]

People v. Warner-Lambert

 

### *People v. Warner-Lambert Co.*

Court of Appeals of New York

414 N.E.2d 660 (N.Y. 1980)

 

The indictment charges each defendant with six counts of manslaughter in
the second degree in violation of section 125.15 of the Penal Law and
six counts of criminally negligent homicide in violation of section
125.10 of the Penal Law in consequence of the deaths of six employees
which resulted from a massive explosion and fire at the Long Island City
Warner-Lambert plant about 2:30 A.M. on November 21, 1976.

On the day on which the explosion occurred, Freshen-Up Gum, which is
retailed in the shape of a square tablet with a jellylike center, was
being produced at the Warner-Lambert plant by a process in which filled
ropes of the gum were passed through a bed of magnesium stearate (MS), a
dry, dustlike lubricant which was applied by hand, then into a die-cut
punch (a Uniplast machine) which was sprayed with a cooling agent
(liquid nitrogen), where the gum was formed into the square tablets.
Both the MS (normally an inert, organic compound) and the liquid
nitrogen were employed to prevent the chicle from adhering to the sizing
and cutting machinery, the tendency to adhere being less if a dry
lubricant was used and the punch was kept at a low temperature. The
process produced a dispersal of MS dust in the air and an accumulation
of it at the base of the Uniplast machine and on overhead pipes; some
also remained ambient in the atmosphere in the surrounding area. 

Both MS and liquid nitrogen are considered safe and are widely used in
the industry. In bulk, MS will only burn or smoulder if ignited;
however, like many substances, if suspended in the air in sufficient
concentration the dust poses a substantial risk of explosion if ignited.
The minimum concentration at which an explosion can occur is denominated
the "lower explosion level" (LEL). Liquid nitrogen, with a boiling
temperature of minus 422 degrees Fahrenheit, is an effective cryogenic
which might play a part in the process of "liquefaction"\-- here, the
production of liquid oxygen in the course of the condensation of air on
its exposure to a source of intense cold. Liquid oxygen is highly
volatile, is easily ignited and, if ignited, will explode. Among
possible causes of such ignition of either liquid oxygen or ambient MS
are electrical or mechanical sparks.

On November 21, 1976 defendant Warner-Lambert was operating six Uniplast
machines in the production of Freshen-Up Gum on the fourth floor of its
Long Island City plant. The machines were in almost constant operation;
however, at the time of the catastrophic explosion near the end of one
of the work shifts only one machine (designated the "D" machine) was in
operation and employees were engaged in removing settled MS dust from
the base of that machine and from overhead pipes by broom sweeping and
by the use of airhoses. Suddenly an explosion occurred in the area of
the operating machine, followed almost immediately by a second, much
larger explosion accompanied by flames which caused injuries to more
than 50 workers in the area (six of whom did not survive) and extensive
damage to the building and equipment, which was attributed to burning of
ambient dust and explosion rather than general fire. Thorough
postcatastrophe investigation eliminated intentional or "man-caused"
ignition as the origin of the event. A New York City Fire Marshal and an
investigator for the United States Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, both of whom examined the scene, testified before the
Grand Jury that a primary explosion had occurred at the "D" machine
which dispersed added MS dust into the atmosphere and could have caused
the second, greater explosion. There was testimony that the ceiling of
the floor below the "D" machine had been covered with peeling paint,
indicating that the temperature of that machine was colder than the
others and that an examination of the machine itself after the explosion
had shown that its base, made of cast iron, had cracked, perhaps by
reason of the cold. An employee present at the time of the occurrence
testified that he had observed a spark in the area of the "D" machine
immediately prior to the event. Although there was no direct proof as to
what had triggered the early morning disaster, the People introduced
expert testimony hypothesizing that there might have been a mechanical
sparking induced by a breakup of metal parts of the Uniplast machine.
Also presented was testimony by one of the People\'s experts who
theorized that liquid oxygen produced through liquefaction occurring in
the Uniplast machine was ignited by the impact of a moving metal part
and that this touched off the dispersed MS dust present.

With respect to the quantity of ambient MS dust in the area of the
Uniplast machines (the presence of which was the basis for the People\'s
submission to the Grand Jury of evidence against the defendants
ultimately indicted), there was proof that an inspection of the plant by
Warner-Lambert\'s insurance carrier in February, 1976 had resulted in
advice to the insured that the dust condition in the Freshen-Up gum
production area presented an explosion hazard and that the MS
concentration was above the LEL, together with recommendations for
installation of a dust exhaust system and modification of electrical
equipment to meet standards for dust areas. Although a variety of
proposals for altering the dust condition were considered by the
individual defendants in consultations and communications with each
other and some alterations in the MS application were made, both ambient
and settled MS dust were still present on November 21, 1976, as the
result of an executive decision to work toward the eventual elimination
of MS entirely by modification of the Freshen-Up equipment. This
modification had been accomplished with respect to only one Uniplast
machine at the date of the explosion, when approximately 500 pounds of
MS a day were still being used in Freshen-Up production. Employees were
wearing face masks and goggles to protect their eyes and breathing
passages, and just prior to the tragedy, when sweeping and airhosing of
accumulated MS were in progress, there was rising dust and a "heavy fog"
or "mist" all around.

First, we look at the evidence as to the actual event or chain of events
which triggered the explosion\--evidence which may only be characterized
as hypothetical and speculative. There was direct testimony by
eyewitnesses, confirmed by reconstruction of the physical evidence that
two explosions occurred. The first was a low-order detonation, occurring
approximately two seconds before the major explosion, at the base of the
"D" Uniplast machine, which was itself found to be in a substantially
fragmented condition with gears, metal shafts, and other parts broken up
and displaced; the second, occurring in rapid succession, was a major
explosion accompanied by fire which caused the massive destruction and
personal injuries. The prosecution hypothesizes that under what it
describes as "the most plausible of theories" the initial detonation was
attributable to mechanical sparking resulting from the breakup of the
metal parts of the Uniplast machine, possibly occasioned by the
machine\'s having become overheated or overloaded, by vibration, or by
slipping of components. Testimony supporting this hypothesis included
descriptions of the condition of the machine after the event, expert
testimony that the physical evidence suggested mechanical failure prior
to the first explosion and testimony of prior instances in which the
machine had become overheated or metal parts had broken off. The
District Attorney adds that "ignition produced by an electrical spark or
arc emission from the non-explosion proof, over loaded Uniplast motor
was not ruled out either."

Another explanation for the initial explosion was offered by an expert
called by the prosecution who hypothesized that liquid oxygen, produced
through liquefaction as air condensed on the liquid nitrogen-cooled
parts of the "D" machine, dripped onto settled MS dust at the base of
the Uniplast, became trapped there and then, when subjected to the
impact caused by a moving metal part, reacted violently, causing
ignition of already dispersed MS.

Viewed most favorably to the People, the proof with respect to the
actual cause of the explosion is speculative only, and as to at least
one of the major hypotheses\--that involving oxygen liquefaction\--there
was no evidence that that process was foreseeable or known to any of the
defendants. In sum, there is no proof sufficient to support a finding
that defendants foresaw or should have foreseen the physical cause of
the explosion. This being so there was not legally sufficient evidence
to establish the offenses charged or any lesser included offense.

It has been the position of the People that but-for causation is all
that is required for the imposition of criminal liability. Thus, it is
their submission, reduced to its simplest form, that there was evidence
of a foreseeable and indeed foreseen risk of explosion of MS dust and
that in consequence of defendants\' failure to remove the dust a fatal
explosion occurred. The chain of physical events by which the explosion
was set off, i.e., its particular cause, is to them a matter of total
indifference. On oral argument the People contended that liability could
be imposed if the cause of the explosion were the lighting of a match by
an uninvited intruder or the striking of a bolt of lightning. In effect
they would hold defendants to the status of guarantors until the ambient
dust was removed. It thus appears that the People would invoke an
expanded application of proximate cause principles lifted from the civil
law of torts.

We have rejected the application of any such sweeping theory of
culpability under our criminal law, however. We recently considered
concepts of criminal culpability grounded in recklessness or negligence
in *People v. Kibbe* (35 N.Y.2d 407). In that case the defendants had
abandoned their helplessly intoxicated robbery victim in subfreezing
temperatures, without shoes or eyeglasses, by the side of an unlighted
highway, and he was shortly thereafter struck and killed by a passing
motorist. The critical issue in the case was whether the defendants
should be held criminally liable for murder when the particular cause of
death was vehicular impact rather than freezing. Under the theory now
advanced by the People it would have been irrelevant that death had been
the consequence of one particular chain of causation rather than
another; it would have been enough that the defendants exposed their
victim to the risk of death and that he died. That, of course, was not
the analysis of culpability that we adopted. Recognizing that "\[a\]
distance separates the negligence which renders one criminally liable
from that which establishes civil liability" \-- both as to quantum and
content of proof\--we held that "the defendants should not be found
guilty unless their conduct \'was a cause of death sufficiently direct
as to meet the requirements of the criminal, and not the tort, law.\'"
"We subscribe to the requirement that the defendants\' actions must be a
sufficiently direct cause of the ensuing death before there can be any
imposition of criminal liability, and recognize, of course, that this
standard is greater than that required to serve as a basis for tort
liability." Thus, we were concerned for the nature of the chain of
particularized events which in fact led to the victim\'s death; it was
not enough that death had occurred as the result of the defendants\'
abandonment of their helpless victim. To analogize the factual situation
in the case now before us to that in *Kibbe* it might be hypothesized
that the abandoned victim in *Kibbe* instead of being either frozen to
death or killed when struck by a passing motor vehicle was killed when
struck by an airplane making an emergency landing on the highway or when
hit by a stray bullet from a hunter\'s rifle\--occasions of death not
reasonably to have been foreseen when the defendants abandoned their
victim.

In view of our disposition of this appeal on the ground that, inasmuch
as the evidence before the Grand Jury was not legally sufficient to
establish the foreseeability of the actual immediate, triggering cause
of the explosion, defendants cannot be held criminally culpable, we have
no occasion to reach or consider whether the steps that they took with
respect to the general risk of explosion were a gross deviation from the
standard of care or conduct that a reasonable person would have observed
in the situation.

For the reasons stated, we conclude that there was not legally
sufficient evidence in this case on the premise of which any jury could
permissibly have imposed criminal liability on any of these defendants.

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and
the indictment dismissed.

People v. Calvaresi

 

### *People v. Calvaresi*

Colorado Supreme Court

534 P.2d 316 (Colo. 1975)

 

This is an appeal from a conviction of manslaughter under 1971
Perm.Supp., C.R.S. § 40-3-1041, 1963. The defendant urges the
unconstitutionality of a portion of the manslaughter statute and error
in some instructions. We reverse and remand for a new trial.

On the night of August 7, 1972, the defendant left a union meeting and
went to his home. He had recently moved, and in his back yard were
tires, car rims, and empty and full moving cartons. He was told by his
wife, upon his return, that she had heard dogs barking and was
frightened. After going to bed, they again heard the dogs barking, and
the defendant went to a back window and saw a man standing at the back
of his truck. He took a .38 caliber revolver out of a drawer and went
out through his back door, where he saw a man run and jump the fence.
The defendant shouted for him to halt, and warned him that he had a gun.
He shouted 'halt' once more, and then fired the gun. The man was hit in
the back, just below his right shoulder. The defendant asked his wife to
call the authorities and an ambulance and the defendant went to the
man\'s aid. When officers came, they advised defendant of his rights,
after which he made a statement, which was introduced at trial without
objection.

The victim, Lobato, was taken to an emergency room at St. Anthony\'s
North Hospital where a doctor examined and treated him. Lobato remained
there for approximately two hours and then was transferred to Colorado
General Hospital. He died en route. At the trial there was testimony to
support defendant\'s theory that Lobato received inadequate medical
treatment at St. Anthony\'s in that, among other things, the doctor
there diagnosed the exit wound below Lobato\'s right front shoulder as
an entrance wound, but did not discover the entrance wound which was on
the back of his right shoulder. Under the circumstances the wisdom of
the transfer was questionable.

The doctor at St. Anthony\'s and one other doctor testified that the
cause of death was the bullet wound, which severed the subclavian
artery. Two other doctors testified that the sole cause of death was the
inadequate medical care received at St. Anthony\'s hospital.

The manslaughter statute provides:

\(1\) A person commits the crime of manslaughter if:

\(a\) He recklessly causes the death of another person;

\(2\) Mansalughter is a class 4 felony.

C.R.S. § 40-3-104.2 (1963)

\[T\]he defendant can be convicted only if his recklessness caused the
death of a person. Defendant argues that there was not enough evidence
of causation to submit the question to the jury. We disagree. However,
we do agree with his next contention that the court erred in not
instructing the jury fully on the issue of causation.

The only instruction relating to causation read:

It is not a defense to one whose act has contributed to the death that
improper treatment on the part of physicians, nurses, or the victim also
contributed thereto; but one who has inflicted an injury is not
responsible for homicide where death results solely from erroneous
treatment by another.

This is not a sufficiently complete statement of the law.

'To warrant a conviction for homicide, the death must be the natural and
probable consequence of the unlawful act, and not the result of an
independent intervening cause in which the accused does not participate,
and which he could not foresee. If it appears that the act of the
accused was not the proximate cause of the death for which he is being
prosecuted, but that another cause intervened, with which he was in no
way connected, and but for which death would not have occurred, such
supervening cause is a defense to the charge of homicide.' 1 Wharton\'s
Crim. Law & Pro., § 200, p. 448 (12th Ed. 1957)

It is defendant\'s contention that the inadequate medical treatment was
such a supervening cause. However, mere negligence on the part of the
attending physician does not constitute a defense. '(N)egligence,
unfortunately, is entirely too frequent a human conduct to be considered
'abnormal." Perkins on Criminal Law, Ch. 6 § 9, p. 716 (2d Ed. 1969). As
stated in Wharton, mere medical negligence can reasonably be foreseen.
We hold, however, that gross negligence is abnormal human behavior,
would not be reasonably foreseeable, and would constitute a defense, if,
but for that gross negligence, death would not have resulted.

On retrial the instructions should include Wharton\'s rule stated above,
as well as the sine qua non rule just mentioned. They should not
condition an acquittal upon death resulting solely from the treatment by
another.

People v. McAfee

 

### *People v. McAfee*

Colorado Court of Appeals

104 P.3d 226 (Co. App. 2004)

 

Early one morning in 1999, defendant drove a car with two passengers
head on into a telephone pole. The passenger in the front seat suffered
two broken legs and head and internal injuries. The passenger in the
back seat suffered massive injuries and died shortly after the accident.

Witnesses to the accident saw defendant exit the car, look at the
damage, and tell one of the injured passengers to "get up" because they
had to "get out of \[t\]here." Defendant told one bystander that "the
driver ran." However, when he was confronted as the driver, defendant
left the scene and got into a cab. When asked by the cab driver where he
was going, he told the driver to "just go." Police caught up with the
cab shortly thereafter.

Investigators found no indication that mechanical failure or external
factors outside the car caused the crash. When defendant was taken to
the police station, he was uncooperative and excited, yelled
profanities, and refused to comply with verbal commands during a
sobriety screening. Defendant\'s blood test for drugs revealed a cocaine
metabolite known as benzoylecgonine, indicating that he had ingested
cocaine within eighteen to twenty-four hours prior to the accident.

Defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced to forty-seven years in
the Department of Corrections.

Defendant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the
jury that the victims\' failure to wear seatbelts constituted gross
negligence and was, therefore, an intervening cause of their injuries.
We are not persuaded.

A defendant is responsible for the natural and probable consequences of
an unlawful act. Thus, the contributory negligence of a victim is not a
defense to vehicular homicide, absent a showing that the victim\'s
conduct was an independent intervening cause of death. An intervening
cause is one which the defendant could not foresee, and must be more
than a contributing cause of the injury.

A victim\'s simple negligence that contributes to an injury is
foreseeable as a matter of law and cannot be an intervening cause.
However, gross negligence is unforeseeable, abnormal human behavior and
may serve as an intervening cause. Further, the trial court must make
the threshold determination whether there was sufficient evidence to
submit an issue to the jury.

A division of this court recently addressed a related issue in *People
v. Lopez*, 97 P.3d 277 (Colo.App. 2004). In *Lopez*, the defendant
abandoned his argument that the victim\'s failure to wear a seatbelt was
an intervening cause of death. Nevertheless, he argued that the seatbelt
evidence was admissible as to whether his conduct was the proximate
cause of the victim\'s death. The *Lopez* division cited Colorado cases
regarding proximate cause and three out-of-state cases holding that the
failure to wear a seatbelt is not an intervening cause. The *Lopez*
division concluded that the failure to use a seatbelt was not a
contributing factor in the collision of the two vehicles, and, thus, the
trial court did not err in rejecting the evidence.

Here, the trial court admitted evidence that the victims were not
wearing seatbelts, but refused to instruct the jury that such conduct
constituted an intervening cause. Defendant\'s intervening cause
argument was not addressed specifically in *Lopez*. However, as noted in
dictum in *Lopez*, the jurisdictions that have considered this
issue---both those cited in *Lopez* and others---have uniformly
concluded that the victim\'s failure to wear a seatbelt does not amount
to an intervening cause.

We agree with these jurisdictions and similarly conclude that the trial
court properly rejected a jury instruction that the victims\' failure to
use seatbelts constituted an intervening cause of their injuries.

Court of Appeals of Michigan

335 N.W.2d 27 (Mich. App. 1983)

 

On October 4, 1980, Kevin Patrick Basnaw committed suicide. On the night
in question, Steven Paul Campbell went to the home of the deceased. They
were drinking quite heavily.

The testimony indicates that late in the evening the deceased began
talking about committing suicide. He had never talked about suicide
before.

About two weeks before, the defendant, Steven Paul Campbell, caught the
deceased in bed with defendant\'s wife, Jill Campbell. Some time during
the talk of suicide, Kevin said he did not have a gun. At first the
defendant, Steven Paul Campbell, indicated Kevin couldn\'t borrow or buy
one of his guns. Then he changed his mind and told him he would sell him
a gun, for whatever amount of money he had in his possession. Then the
deceased, Kevin Basnaw, indicated he did not want to buy a gun, but
Steve Campbell continued to encourage Kevin to purchase a gun, and
alternately ridiculed him.

The defendant and the deceased then drove to the defendant\'s parent\'s
home to get the weapon, leaving Kimberly Cleland, the deceased\'s
girlfriend, alone. Even though she knew of the plan, she did not call
anyone during this period of time. She indicated she thought the
defendant was saying this to get a ride home.

The defendant and the deceased returned in about fifteen minutes with
the gun and five shells. The deceased told his girlfriend to leave with
the defendant because he was going to kill himself. He put the shells
and the gun on the kitchen table and started to write a suicide note.

The defendant and the deceased\'s girlfriend left about 3 to 3:30 a.m.
When they left, the shells were still on the table.

Next morning, one Billy Sherman arrived at about 11:30 a.m. and he and
the deceased\'s roommate found the deceased slumped at the kitchen table
with the gun in his hand. Dr. Kopp, the county Pathologist, listed the
cause of death as suicide; self-inflicted wound to the temple. No
autopsy was performed. No time of death was established.

The prosecutor argues that inciting to suicide, coupled with the overt
act of furnishing a gun to an intoxicated person, in a state of
depression, falls within the prohibition, "or other wilful, deliberate
and premeditated killing".

There exists no statutory definition of the term "murder." That crime is
defined in the common law.

"Homicide is the killing of one human being by another.\" The term
suicide excludes by definition a homicide. Simply put, the defendant
here did not kill another person.

Defendant had no present intention to kill. He provided the weapon and
departed. Defendant hoped Basnaw would kill himself but hope alone is
not the degree of intention requisite to a charge of murder.

\[I\]t is not clear that incitement to suicide was ever considered
murder at the common law. Certainly, attempted suicide was not held to
be attempted murder.

While we find the conduct of the defendant morally reprehensible, we do
not find it to be criminal under the present state of the law.

The remedy for this situation is in the Legislature. We invite them to
adopt legislation on the subject as set forth in the Michigan Proposed
Criminal Code.

The trial court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions
to quash the information and warrant and discharge the defendant.

Stephenson v. State

 

TW: Sexual Assault and Suicide

 

### *Stephenson v. State*

Supreme Court of Indiana

179 N.E. 633 (Ind. 1932)

 

The Grand Jurors for the County of Marion and State of Indiana upon
their oaths, present that David C. Stephenson, Earl Gentry and Earl
Klinck, on or about the 16th day of April, A. D. 1925, at and in the
County of Marion and State aforesaid, did then and there unlawfully,
feloniously and with premeditated malice kill and murder Madge
Oberholtzer in the manner and form and by the means following, towit:
That said David C. Stephenson, Earl Gentry and Earl Klinck did then and
there on the 16th day of March, 1925, wrongfully, unlawfully and
feloniously by force of arms and by duress and by putting her the said
Madge Oberholtzer in fear and against her will take possession of the
body and person of her, the said Madge Oberholtzer, and did then and
there wrongfully, unlawfully and feloniously by force of arms and by
duress and by putting her, the said Madge Oberholtzer in fear and
against her will place her in a drawing room of a certain pullman
passenger car which was then and there a part of a railroad train, which
train was then and there scheduled to and did shortly thereafter depart
from the city of Indianapolis for a regular trip to the City of Chicago;
and said defendants did then and there wrongfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, by force of arms and by duress and by putting her, the said
Madge Oberholtzer in fear and against her will restrain her of her
liberty in the drawing room of said car on said train during the
progress of said train to the city of Chicago until the city of Hammond,
in the State of Indiana, was reached; and said defendants did unlawfully
and feloniously while so holding possession of the body and person of
said Madge Oberholtzer, as aforesaid, and so restraining her of her
liberty in the drawing room of said car as aforesaid, upon the body and
person of her, the said Madge Oberholtzer, commit an assault, and did
her, the said Madge Oberholtzer, unlawfully and feloniously in a rude
and insolent manner her the said Madge Oberholtzer strike, beat, bite
and grievously wound with the unlawful and felonious intent her, the
said Madge Oberholtzer, to ravish and carnally know forcibly and against
her will; and said defendants when said train arrived at the City of
Hammond at about 6 o\'clock in the morning of the 17th day of March,
1925, still unlawfully and feloniously, while so holding possession of
her the said Madge Oberholtzer and so restraining her of her liberty as
aforesaid did cause her to depart from said car of said train and to
enter the room of a hotel in said city of Hammond and to occupy a bed
with said defendant Stephenson; that thereafter on the said 17th day of
March, 1925, in said city of Hammond, the said Madge Oberholtzer,
distracted with the pain and shame so inflicted upon her by said
defendants as aforesaid, did procure and swallow into her stomach a
large quantity of deadly poison, towit: Bichloride of mercury; that said
defendants on said day with full knowledge that she the said Madge
Oberholtzer had taken said poison as aforesaid and although requested by
her so to do did unlawfully, feloniously and wilfully wholly fail and
refuse to procure for or furnish to her the said Madge Oberholtzer any
antidote for said poison or any attention or help from any physician or
any one skilled in counteracting the effects of said poison although
they and each of them were then and there fully able to procure such
antidote and the help of such physician; that said defendants did, on
the afternoon and night of said March 17th, still unlawfully and
feloniously by force of arms and by duress and by putting her the said
Madge Oberholtzer in fear holding possession of the body and person of
her the said Madge Oberholtzer and restraining her of her liberty, place
her in an automobile and by said vehicle did transport her back to the
city of Indianapolis and did during said night and until near noon of
the 18th day of March so hold possession of her body and person and
restrain her of her liberty as aforesaid in a room in a garage of said
defendant Stephenson, and did at all times during said return and at all
times during the imprisonment of her the said Madge Oberholtzer in said
garage unlawfully and feloniously wholly fail and refuse to furnish or
provide for or administer to her any antidote for said poison and did
unlawfully and feloniously wholly fail and refuse to procure for her or
furnish to her any attention by or help from any physician or any one
skilled in counteracting the effects of said poison although they said
defendants and each of them were then and there fully able to procure
such antidote and help from such physician; that thereafter she the said
Madge Oberholtzer did at and in the County of Marion aforesaid languish
and languishing did thereafter on April 14, 1925, in said County die
from the effect of her wounds inflicted as aforesaid and said poison
taken as aforesaid.

Appellant very earnestly argues that the evidence does not show
appellant guilty of murder. He points out in his brief that, after they
reached the hotel, Madge Oberholtzer left the hotel and purchased a hat
and the poison, and voluntarily returned to his room, and at the time
she took the poison she was in an adjoining room to him, and that she
swallowed the poison without his knowledge, and at a time when he was
not present. From these facts, he contends that she took her life by
committing suicide; that her own act in taking the poison was an
intervening responsible agent which broke the causal connection between
his acts and the death; that his acts were not the proximate cause of
her death, but the taking of the poison was the proximate cause of
death.

In the case of *State v. Preslar* 48 N.C. 421 (1856), the defendant in
the nighttime fought with his wife, and she left to go to the home of
her father. When she reached a point about two hundred yards from her
father\'s home, she, for some reason, did not want to go in the house
till morning, laid down on a bed cover, which she had wrapped around
her, till daylight. The weather was cold and the next morning she could
not walk, but made herself known. She afterwards died. The court held
that the wife without necessity exposed herself, and the defendant was
not guilty. In *Rex v. Valade* (Que.) 22 Rev. de Jur. 524, 26 Can. Cr.
Cas. 233, where the accused induced a young girl under the age of
consent to go along with him to a secluded apartment, and there had
criminal sexual intercourse with her, following which she jumped from a
window to the street to get away from him, and was killed by the fall.
The accused was held guilty of murder. Bishop in his work on Criminal
Law, vol. 2, (9th Ed.) page 484, says: "When suicide follows a wound
inflicted by the defendant his act is homicidal, if deceased was
rendered irresponsible by the wound and as a natural result of it." We
do not understand that by the rule laid down by Bishop, supra, that the
wound which renders the deceased mentally irresponsible is necessarily
limited to a physical wound. We should think the same rule would apply
if a defendant engaged in the commission of a felony such as rape or
attempted rape, and inflicts upon his victim both physical and mental
injuries, the natural and probable result of which would render the
deceased mentally irresponsible and suicide followed, we think he would
be guilty of murder.

We think the evidence shows that the deceased was at all times from the
time she was entrapped by the appellant at his home on the evening of
March 15th till she returned to her home two days later, in the custody
and absolute control of appellant. Neither do we think the fact that the
deceased took the poison some four hours after they left the
drawing--room on the train or after the crime of attempted rape had been
committed necessarily prevents it from being a part of the attempted
rape. Suppose they had not left the drawing--room on the train, and,
instead of the deceased taking poison, she had secured possession of
appellant\'s revolver and shot herself or thrown herself out of the
window of the car and died from the fall. We can see no vital
difference. At the very moment Madge Oberholtzer swallowed the poison
she was subject to the passion, desire, and will of appellant. She knew
not what moment she would be subjected to the same demands that she was
while in the drawing--room on the train. What would have prevented
appellant from compelling her to submit to him at any moment? The same
forces, the same impulses, that would impel her to shoot herself during
the actual attack or throw herself out of the car window after the
attack had ceased, was pressing and overwhelming her at the time she
swallowed the poison. The evidence shows that she was so weak that she
staggered as she left the elevator to go to the room in the hotel, and
was assisted by appellant and Gentry. That she was very ill, so much so
that she could not eat, all of which was the direct and proximate result
of the treatment accorded her by appellant. To say that there is no
causal connection between the acts of appellant and the death of Madge
Oberholtzer, and that the treatment accorded her by appellant had no
causal connection with the death of Madge Oberholtzer would be a
travesty on justice. We therefore conclude that the evidence was
sufficient and justified the jury in finding that appellant by his acts
and conduct rendered the deceased distracted and mentally irresponsible,
and that such was the natural and probable consequence of such unlawful
and criminal treatment, and that the appellant was guilty of murder in
the second degree as charged in the first count of the indictment.

State v. McFadden

 

### *State v. McFadden*

Supreme Court of Iowa

320 N.W. 2d 608 (Ia. 1982)

 

ALLBEE, Justice.

This case stems from a drag race between defendant Michael Dwayne
McFadden and another driver, Matthew Sulgrove, which occurred on a Des
Moines city street in April 1980. During the course of the two
vehicles\' southbound progression, Sulgrove lost control of his
automobile and swerved into a lane of oncoming traffic, where he struck
a lawfully operated northbound vehicle. This third vehicle contained a
six-year-old passenger, Faith Ellis, who was killed in the collision
along with Sulgrove. Defendant\'s automobile did not physically contact
either of the two colliding vehicles. Further details concerning the
race and the accident will be related as necessary for treatment of the
issues raised by defendant.

Defendant was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, a
violation of section 707.5(1), The Code 1979. Having waived a jury,
defendant was tried to the court and convicted and sentenced on both
counts.

\[The t\]rial court found that defendant was guilty of involuntary
manslaughter under each of three separate theories: (1) that defendant
aided and abetted Sulgrove in Sulgrove\'s commission of involuntary
manslaughter, see § 703.1, The Code 1979 (defining aiding and abetting);
(2) that defendant was vicariously responsible for Sulgrove\'s
commission of involuntary manslaughter by reason of their joint
participation in the public offense of drag racing, see § 703.2, The
Code 1979 (defining joint criminal conduct); and (3) that defendant
himself committed the crime of involuntary manslaughter by recklessly
engaging in a drag race so as to proximately cause the Sulgrove-Ellis
collision.

We note that aiding and abetting and joint criminal conduct are theories
of vicarious liability, based on Sulgrove\'s commission of involuntary
manslaughter. Although a vicarious liability theory may be sufficient to
convict defendant for the death of Faith Ellis, the same is not true
with regard to the death of Sulgrove. This is because the involuntary
manslaughter statute requires proof that the perpetrator caused the
death of "another person." See § 707.5(1). Obviously, Sulgrove could not
have committed involuntary manslaughter with respect to his own death.
Therefore, a theory under which defendant is only vicariously liable for
Sulgrove\'s crime would be inadequate to convict defendant for
Sulgrove\'s death.

We turn, then, to consideration of the third theory of liability, i.e.,
that defendant\'s reckless commission of the public offense of drag
racing was a proximate cause of the Sulgrove and Ellis deaths.

Preliminarily, we note that the fact that defendant\'s automobile did
not physically contact either of the other two vehicles does not,
standing alone, preclude his conviction. This rule was established in
Iowa in another drag-racing case, *State v. Youngblut*, 132 N.W.2d 486
(1965), where a defendant was held to have been properly charged with
involuntary manslaughter under similar facts. Having taken initial note
of *Youngblut*, we proceed to address defendant\'s legal arguments
concerning causation.

\[D\]efendant contends trial court erred in applying the civil standard
of proximate cause in a criminal prosecution, rather than adopting the
more stringent standard of "direct causal connection" used by the
Pennsylvania court in *Commonwealth v. Root*, 403 Pa. 571, 580 (1961).
In *Root*, the court held that "the tort liability concept of proximate
cause has no proper place in prosecutions for criminal homicide and more
direct causal connection is required for conviction."

We had occasion to consider a similar standard-of-causation issue in
*State v. Marti*, 290 N.W.2d 570, 584-85 (Iowa 1980), which upheld the
involuntary manslaughter conviction of a man who provided an obviously
intoxicated, suicidal woman with the means to shoot herself by loading a
gun for her and placing it within her reach. As here, the defendant in
*Marti* argued that the trial court "inappropriately adopted the
standards of proximate cause applied in civil cases." Unlike the
Pennsylvania court in *Root*, however, we said in *Marti* that we were
"unwilling to hold as a blanket rule of law that instructions used in
civil trials regarding proximate cause are inappropriate for criminal
trials." *Id.* We explained:

One reason for this is the similar functions that the requirement of
proximate cause plays in both sorts of trials. The element of proximate
cause in criminal prosecutions serves as a requirement that there be a
sufficient causal relationship between the defendant\'s conduct and a
proscribed harm to hold him criminally responsible. Similarly, in the
law of torts it is the element that requires there to be a sufficient
causal relationship between the defendant\'s conduct and the
plaintiff\'s damage to hold the defendant civilly liable.

We did note in *Marti*, however, that legal causation (as opposed to
factual causation) is "essentially a question of whether the policy of
the law will extend the responsibility for the conduct to the
consequences which have in fact occurred." *Id.* at 585 (quoting W.
Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts § 42, at 244 (4th ed. (1971)).
Further, we recognized "that different policy considerations may come
into play in criminal prosecutions than in civil trials," and that an
"argument could be made that these differences should be reflected in
the proximate cause instructions used in the different kinds of trials."

Finally, defendant has suggested no specific policy differences, nor can
we think of any, that would justify a different standard of proximate
causation under our involuntary manslaughter statute than under our tort
law. The Root court opined that "\[l\]egal theory which makes guilt or
innocence of criminal homicide depend upon such accidental and
fortuitous circumstances as are now embraced by modern tort law\'s
encompassing concept of proximate cause is too harsh to be just." 403
Pa. at 576, 170 A.2d at 312. We do not agree. Proximate cause is based
on the concept of foreseeability. We believe the foreseeability
requirement, coupled with the requirement of recklessness, will prevent
the possibility of harsh or unjust results in involuntary manslaughter
cases. We disagree with the *Root* court\'s apparent opinion that drag
racing on a public street is "not generally considered to present the
likelihood of a resultant death."

Accordingly, we hold that trial court did not err in applying ordinary
proximate cause principles to determine whether the causation element of
section 707.5(1) had been met, and in declining to adopt the more
stringent "direct causal connection" standard of *Root*.

 

 

 

5.1.2.4

Commonwealth v. Atencio

 

### *Commonwealth v. Atencio*

Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts

189 N.E.2d 223 (Mass. 1963)

 

On Sunday, October 22, 1961, \[Stewart E. Britch\], his brother Ronald,
and the defendants spent the day drinking wine in the deceased\'s room
in a rooming house in Boston. At some time in the afternoon, with
reference to nothing specific so far as the record discloses, Marshall
said, 'I will settle this,' went out, and in a few minutes returned
clicking a gun, from which he removed one bullet. Early in the evening
Ronald left, and the conversation turned to 'Russian roulette.'

The 'game' was played. The deceased and Atencio were seated on a bed,
and Marshall was seated on a couch. First, Marshall examined the gun,
saw that it contained one cartridge, and, after spinning it on his arm,
pointed it at his head, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He
handed the gun to Atencio, who repeated the process, again without
result. Atencio passed the gun to the deceased, who spun it, put to his
head, and pulled the trigger. The cartridge exploded, and he fell over
dead.

There is no controversy as to definition. Involuntary manslaughter may
be predicated upon wanton or reckless conduct. 'The essence of wanton or
reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way either of commission or
of omission where there is a duty to act, which conduct involves a high
degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.'
*Commonwealth v. Welansky*, 316 Mass. 383, 399.

We are of opinion that the defendants could properly have been found
guilty of manslaughter. This is not a civil action against the
defendants by the personal representative of Stewart Britch. In such a
case his voluntary act, we assume, would be a bar. Here the Commonwealth
had an interest that the deceased should not be killed by the wanton or
reckless conduct of himself and others. Such conduct could be found in
the concerted action and coöperation of the defendants in helping to
bring about the deceased\'s foolish act. The jury did not have to
believe testimony that the defendants at the last moment tried to
dissuade the deceased from doing that which they had just done
themselves.

The defendants argue as if it should have been ruled, as matter of law,
that there were three 'games\' of solitaire and not one 'game' of
'Russian roulette.' That the defendants participated could be found to
be a cause and not a mere condition of Stewart Britch\'s death. It is
not correct to say that his act could not be found to have been caused
by anything which Marshall and Atencio did, not that he would have died
when the gun went off in his hand no matter whether they had done the
same. The testimony does not require a ruling that when the deceased
took the gun from Atencio it was an independent or intervening act not
standing in any relation to the defendants\' acts which would render
what he did imputable to them. It is an oversimplification to contend
that each participated in something that only one could do at a time.
There could be found to be a mutual encouragement in a joint enterprise.
In the abstract, there may have been no duty on the defendants to
prevent the deceased from playing. But there was a duty on their part
not to cooperate or join with him in the 'game.' Nor, if the facts
presented such a case, would we have to agree that if the deceased, and
not the defendants, had played first that they could not have been found
guilty of manslaughter. The defendants were much more than merely
present at a crime. It would not be necessary that the defendants force
the deceased to play or suggest that he play.

We are referred in both briefs to cases of manslaughter arising out of
automobiles racing upon the public highway. When the victim is a third
person, there is no difficulty in holding the drivers, including the one
whose car did not strike the victim or in whose car a victim was not a
passenger.

In two cases the driver of a noncolliding car has been prosecuted for
the death of his competitor, and in both cases an appellate court has
ruled that he was not guilty of manslaughter. In *Commonwealth v. Root*,
403 Pa. 571, the competitor drove on the wrong side of the road head-on
into an oncoming truck and was killed. The court that 'the tort
liability concept of proximate cause has no proper place in prosecutions
for criminal homicide and more direct causal connection is required for
conviction. \* \* \* In the instant case, the defendant\'s reckless
conduct was not a sufficiently direct cause of the competing driver\'s
death to make hime criminally liable therefor.' In *Thacker v. State*,
103 Ga.App. 36, 117 S.E.2d 913, the defendant was indicted for the
involuntary manslaughter of his competitor in a drag race who was killed
when he lost control of his car and left the highway. The court said
that the indictment 'fails to allege any act or acts on the part of the
defendant which caused or contributed to the loss of control of the
vehicle driven by the deceased, other than the fact that they were
engaged in a race at the time.'

Whatever may be thought of those two decisions, there is a very real
distinction between drag racing and 'Russian roulette.' In the former
much is left to the skill, or lack of it, of the competitor. In 'Russian
roulette' it is a matter of luck as to the location of the one bullet,
and except for a misfire (of which there was evidence in the case at
bar) the outcome is a certainty if the chamber under the hammer happens
to be the one containing the bullet.

The judgments on the indictments for manslaughter are affirmed. The
judgments on the indictments for carrying a revolver on the person are
reversed, and the verdicts on those indictments are set aside.

 

 

 

5.2

Attempt

 

Attempt, an "inchoate" offense, lies somewhere between merely thinking
about committing a crime and successfully doing so. How far along this
continuum should one have to proceed before her actions are deemed
criminal? Furthermore, how should we think about culpability for attempt
vis-a-vis culpability for the completed offense? If the defendant
intended to cause a harm, and tried with all of her will to do so, why
should we excuse her, even partially, if the desired harm fails to
occur?

 

 

 

 

5.2.1

Actus Reus

 

In a free society, thinking about committing a crime is not enough to
make a defendant legally responsible for attempting it, or of committing
any other crime. Rather, it must be shown that the defendant took some
steps toward the commission of the offense (and, as we\'ll see, have a
sufficiently culpable mental state). But just how far down the road from
thinking about a crime to preparing to commit it, to actually committing
it, must a defendant travel before it is fair to convict him of
attempting to commit it?

 

 

 

 

5.2.1.1

People v. Rizzo

 

### *People v. Rizzo*

New York Court of Appeals

158 N.E. 888 (N.Y. 1927)

 

CRANE, J.

The police of the city of New York did excellent work in this case by
preventing the commission of a serious crime. It is a great satisfaction
to realize that we have such wide­-awake guardians of our peace. Whether
or not the steps which the defendant had taken up to the time of his
arrest amounted to the commission of at crime, as defined by our law,
is, however, another matter. He has been convicted of an attempt to
commit the crime of robbery in the first degree and sentenced to State's
prison. There is no doubt that he had the intention to commit robbery if
he got the chance. An examination, however, of the facts is necessary to
determine whether his acts were in preparation to commit the crime if
the opportunity offered, or constituted a crime in itself, known to our
law as an attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. Charles Rizzo,
the defendant, appellant, with three others, Anthony Dorio, Thomas Milo
and John Thomasello, on January 14th planned to rob one Charles Rao of a
payroll valued at about \$31,200 which he was to carry from the bank for
the United Lathing Company. These defendants, two of whom had firearms,
started out in an automobile, looking for Rao or the man who had the
payroll on that day. Rizzo claimed to be able to identify the man and
was to point him out to the others who were to do the actual holding up.
The four rode about in their car looking for Rao. They went to the bank
from which he was supposed to get the money and to various buildings
being constructed by the United Lathing Company. At last they came to
One Hundred and Eightieth street and Morris Park avenue. By this time
they were watched and followed by two police officers. As Rizzo jumped
out of the car and ran into the building all- four were arrested. The
defendant was taken out from the building in which he was hiding.
Neither Rao nor a man named Previti, who was also supposed to carry a
payroll, were at the place at the time of the arrest. The defendants had
not found or seen the man they intended to rob; no person with a payroll
was at any of the places where they had stopped no one had been pointed
out or identified by Rizzo. The four men intended to rob the payroll
man, whoever he was; they were looking for him, but they had not seen or
discovered him up to the time they were arrested.

Does this constitute the crime of an attempt to commit robbery in the
first degree? The Penal Law, section 2, prescribes: An act, done with
intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its
commission, is \"an attempt to commit that crime\". The word tending is
very indefinite. It is perfectly evident that there will arise
differences of opinion as to whether an act in a given case is one
tending. to commit a crime. Tending means to exert activity in a
particular direction. Any act in preparation to commit a crime may be
said to have a tendency towards its accomplishment. The procuring of the
automobile, searching the streets looking for the desired victim, were
in reality acts tending toward the commission of the proposed crime. The
law, however, has recognized that many acts in the way of preparation
are too remote to constitute the crime of attempt. The line has been
drawn between those acts which are remote and those which are proximate
and near to the consummation. The law must be practical, and, therefore,
considers those acts only as tending to the commission of the crime
which are so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable
probability the crime itself would, have been committed but for timely
interference. The cases which have been before the courts express this
idea in different language, but the idea remains the same. The act or
acts must come or advance very near to the accomplishment of the
intended crime. In *People v. Mills* (178 N. Y. 274) it was said:
"Felonious intent alone is not enough, but there must be an overt act
shown in order to establish even an attempt. An overt act is one done to
carry out the intention, and it must be such as would naturally effect
that result, unless prevented by some extraneous cause." In *Hyde V. U.
S.* (225 U.S. 347) it was stated that the act amounts to an attempt when
it is so near to the result that the danger, of success is very great.
There must be dangerous proximity to success."

The method of committing or attempting crime varies in each case so that
the difficulty, if any, is not with this rule of law regarding an
attempt, which is well understood, but with its application to the
facts.

How shall we apply this rule of immediate nearness to this case? The
defendants were looking for the payroll man to rob him of his money.
This is the charge in the indictment. Robbery is defined in section 2120
of the Penal Law as the unlawful taking of personal property, from the
person or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of
force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his
person; and it is made robbery in the first degree by section 2124 when
committed by a person aided by accomplices actually present. To
constitute the crime of robbery the money must have been taken from Rao
by means of force or violence, or through fear. The crime of attempt to
commit robbery was committed if these defendants did any act tending to
the commission of this robbery. Did the acts above describe come
dangerously near to the taking of Rao's property? Did the acts come so
near the commission of robbery that there was reasonable likelihood of
its accomplishment but for the interference? Rao was not found the
defendants were still looking for him; no attempt to rob him could be
made, at least until he came in sight; he was not in the building at One
Hundred and Eightieth street and Morris Park Avenue. There was no man
there with the payroll for the United Lathing Company whom these
defendants could rob. Apparently, no money had been drawn from the bank
for the payroll by anybody at the time of the arrest. In a word, these
defendants had planned to commit a crime and were looking around the
city for an opportunity to commit it, but the opportunity fortunately
never came. Men would not be guilty of an attempt at burglary if they
had planned to break into a building and were arrested while they were
hunting about the streets for the building not knowing where it was.
Neither would a man be guilty of an attempt to commit murder if he armed
himself and started out to find the person whom he had planned to kill
but could not him. So here these defendants were not guilty of an
attempt to commit robbery in the first degree when they had not found or
reached the presence of the person they intended to rob.

For these reasons, the judgment of conviction of this defendant,
appellant, must be reversed and a new trial granted.

McQuirter v. State

 

McQuirter is an example of racial prejudice and a court inviting a jury
to jump to conclusions based on the race of the defendant and the
purported victim. In that way it is obviously deplorable. But as you
read it, consider how different it is from *Rizzo*. What is the
difference between the two cases in terms of when the government should
intervene before a crime has been committed? What role does mens rea
play in coming to that conclusion?

 

### *McQuirter v. State*

Court of Appeals of Alabama

63 So.2d 388 (1953)

 

PRICE, Judge.

Appellant, a Negro man, was found guilty of an attempt to commit an
assault with intent to rape, under an indictment charging an assault
with intent to rape. The jury assessed a fine of \$500.

About 8:00 o\'clock on the night of June 29, 1951, Mrs. Ted Allen, a
white woman, with her two children and a neighbor\'s little girl, were
drinking Coca-Cola at the \"Tiny Diner\" in Atmore. When they started in
the direction of Mrs. Allen\'s home she noticed appellant sitting in the
cab of a parked truck. As she passed the truck appellant said something
unintelligible, opened the truck door and placed his foot on the running
board.

Mrs. Allen testified appellant followed her down the street and when she
reached Suell Lufkin\'s house she stopped. As she turned into the Lufkin
house appellant was within two or three feet of her. She waited ten
minutes for appellant to pass. When she proceeded on her way, appellant
came toward her from behind a telephone pole. She told the children to
run to Mr. Simmons\' house and tell him to come and meet her. When
appellant saw Mr. Simmons he turned and went back down the street to the
intersection and leaned on a stop sign just across the street from Mrs.
Allen\'s home. Mrs. Allen watched him at the sign from Mr. Simmons\'
porch for about thirty minutes, after which time he came back down the
street and appellant went on home.

Mrs. Allen\'s testimony was corroborated by that of her young daughter.
The daughter testified the appellant was within six feet of her mother
as she approached the Lufkin house, and this witness said there was a
while when she didn\'t see appellant at the intersection.

Mr. Lewis Simmons testified when the little girls ran up on his porch
and said a Negro was after them, witness walked up the sidewalk to meet
Mrs. Allen and saw appellant. Appellant went on down the street and
stopped in front of Mrs. Allen\'s home and waited there approximately
thirty minutes.

Mr. Clarence Bryars, a policeman in Atmore, testified that appellant
stated after his arrest that he came to Atmore with the intention of
getting him a white woman that night.

Mr. W. E. Strickland, Chief of Police of Atmore, testified that
appellant stated in the Atmore jail he didn\'t know what was the matter
with him; that he was drinking a little; that he and his partner had
been to Pensacola; that his partner went to the \"Front\" to see a
colored woman; that he didn\'t have any money and he sat in the truck
and made up his mind he was going to get the first woman that came by
and that this was the first woman that came by. He said he got out of
the truck, came around the gas tank and watched the lady and when she
started off he started off behind her; that he was going to carry her in
the cotton patch and if she hollered he was going to kill her. He
testified appellant made the same statement in the Brewton jail.

Mr. Norvelle Seals, Chief Deputy Sheriff, corroborated Mr. Strickland\'s
testimony as to the statement by appellant at the Brewton jail.

Appellant, as a witness in his own behalf, testified he and Bill Page,
another Negro, carried a load of junk-iron from Monroeville to
Pensacola; on their way back to Monroeville they stopped in Atmore. They
parked the truck near the \"Tiny Diner\" and rode to the \"Front,\" the
colored section, in a cab. Appellant came back to the truck around 8:00
o\'clock and sat in the truck cab for about thirty minutes. He decided
to go back to the \"Front\" to look for Bill Page. As he started up the
street he saw prosecutrix and her children. He turned around and waited
until he decided they had gone, then he walked up the street toward the
\"Front.\" When he reached the intersection at the telegraph pole he
decided he didn\'t want to go to the \"Front\" and sat around there a
few minutes, then went on to the \"Front\" and stayed about 25 or 30
minutes, and came back to the truck.

He denied that he followed Mrs. Allen or made any gesture toward
molesting her or the children. He denied making the statements testified
to by the officers.

He testified he had never been arrested before and introduced testimony
by two residents of Monroeville as to his good reputation for peace and
quiet and for truth and veracity.

Appellant insists the trial court erred in refusing the general
affirmative charge and in denying the motion for a new trial on the
ground the verdict was contrary to the evidence.

\"\'An attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape,\' . . . means
an attempt to rape which has not proceeded far enough to amount to an
assault\". *Burton v. State*, 8 Ala.App. 295, 62 So. 394, 396.

Under the authorities in this state, to justify a conviction for an
attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to have
sexual intercourse with prosecutrix against her will, by force or by
putting her in fear.

Intent is a question to be determined by the jury from the facts and
circumstances adduced on the trial, and if there is evidence from which
it may be inferred that at the time of the attempt defendant intended to
gratify his lustful desires against the resistance of the female a jury
question is presented.

In determining the question of intention the jury may consider social
conditions and customs founded upon racial differences, such as that the
prosecutrix was a white woman and defendant was a Negro man.

After considering the evidence in this case we are of the opinion it was
sufficient to warrant the submission of the question of defendant\'s
guilt to the jury, and was ample to sustain the judgment of conviction.

Defense counsel contends in brief that the testimony of the officers as
to defendant\'s declarations of intent was inadmissible because no
attempt or overt act toward carrying that intent into effect had been
proven.

Defendant\'s grounds of objection to this evidence were that it was
\"irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial.\" Proper predicates were laid
for the introduction of each of said statements. In the absence of a
ground of objection calling the court\'s attention to the fact that the
corpus delicti has not been sufficiently proven to authorize admission
of a confession such question cannot be reviewed here.

Moreover, if any facts are proven from which the jury may reasonably
infer that the crime has been committed proof of the confession is
rendered admissible. We find no reversible error in the record and the
judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

Affirmed.

Colorado Stalking Statute \-- Vonnie\'s Law

 

Colorado Criminal Code § 18-3-602.

 

The Colorado legislature passed the following statute in an attempt to
criminalize disconcerting conduct that does not rise to the level of an
attempt. In 2023, the United States Supreme Court found this statute to
be unconstitutional in the case of *Counterman v. Colorado*. Consider
why this statute might be constitutionally infirm as you read the
following description of the prohibited conduct.

 

(1) A person commits stalking if directly, or indirectly through another
person, the person knowingly:

(a) Makes a credible threat to another person and, in connection with
the threat, repeatedly follows, approaches, contacts, or places under
surveillance that person, a member of that person\'s immediate family,
or someone with whom that person has or has had a continuing
relationship;  or

(b) Makes a credible threat to another person and, in connection with
the threat, repeatedly makes any form of communication with that person,
a member of that person\'s immediate family, or someone with whom that
person has or has had a continuing relationship, regardless of whether a
conversation ensues;  or

(c) Repeatedly follows, approaches, contacts, places under surveillance,
or makes any form of communication with another person, a member of that
person\'s immediate family, or someone with whom that person has or has
had a continuing relationship in a manner that would cause a reasonable
person to suffer serious emotional distress and does cause that person,
a member of that person\'s immediate family, or someone with whom that
person has or has had a continuing relationship to suffer serious
emotional distress.  For purposes of this paragraph (c), a victim need
not show that he or she received professional treatment or counseling to
show that he or she suffered serious emotional distress.

(2) For the purposes of this part 6:

(a) Conduct "in connection with" a credible threat means acts that
further, advance, promote, or have a continuity of purpose, and may
occur before, during, or after the credible threat.

(b) "Credible threat" means a threat, physical action, or repeated
conduct that would cause a reasonable person to be in fear for the
person\'s safety or the safety of his or her immediate family or of
someone with whom the person has or has had a continuing relationship.
 The threat need not be directly expressed if the totality of the
conduct would cause a reasonable person such fear.

(c) "Immediate family" includes the person\'s spouse and the person\'s
parent, grandparent, sibling, or child.

(d) "Repeated" or "repeatedly" means on more than one occasion.

(3) A person who commits stalking:  

(a) Commits a class 5 felony for a first offense except as otherwise
provided in subsection (5) of this section;  or

(b) Commits a class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense, if the
offense occurs within seven years after the date of a prior offense for
which the person was convicted.

O\'Shaughnessy v. People

 

### *O'Shaughnessy v. People*

Colorado Supreme Court

269 P.3d 1233 (Colo. 2012)

 

Justice RICE delivered the Opinion of the Court.

**I. Introduction**

We granted certiorari in this case to review whether the court of
appeals imposed an unauthorized restriction on the affirmative defense
of abandonment when it held that a defendant was not entitled to a jury
instruction on abandonment when charged with attempted first degree
murder with a deadly weapon or with attempted aggravated robbery once
the defendant injured the victim. We hold that to present an affirmative
defense of abandonment of an attempt crime for jury consideration the
defendant must present "some credible evidence" on the issue. Further,
we hold that having injured the victim does not necessarily foreclose
the affirmative defense of abandonment. Nonetheless, we agree that here
the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative
defense of abandonment because the defendant failed to present
sufficient evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.

**II. Facts and Proceedings Below**

Uncontroverted evidence presented at trial showed that Geri David was
attacked in the parking lot of a grocery store on the morning of
September 13, 2004, by a man she later identified as Michael
O\'Shaughnessy. She was approached from behind by O\'Shaughnessy, who
was brandishing a six-inch hunting knife with a serrated blade. He held
the knife to her face and ordered her into her car. She sat in the
driver\'s seat with her feet outside of the car and kicked at her
assailant to ward off the attack. As she lashed out at him, he stabbed
her with the knife, causing injury to the right and left sides of her
neck and throat, to her left thigh, and to her hand.

At that point, O\'Shaughnessy said, "You\'re going to die," and demanded
her money. David told him she did not have any money and turned toward
the floor of the passenger seat to look for her purse. When she turned
back, O\'Shaughnessy was gone. He did not reach for or take the purse.

A jury convicted O\'Shaughnessy of attempted first degree murder with a
deadly weapon, attempted aggravated robbery, second degree assault,
false imprisonment, reckless endangerment, and a violent crime sentence
enhancer. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences for the crimes
of attempted murder, attempted aggravated robbery, and second degree
assault. During the course of the trial, O\'Shaughnessy requested a jury
instruction on the affirmative defense of abandonment. The trial court
denied the request.

We granted certiorari to determine whether the court of appeals imposed
an unauthorized restriction on the affirmative defense of abandonment.

**III. Analysis**

The issue before this Court is whether the court of appeals imposed an
unauthorized restriction on the affirmative defense of abandonment when
it held that a defendant is not entitled to a jury instruction on
abandonment when charged with attempted first degree murder with a
deadly weapon, or with attempted aggravated robbery, once the defendant
has injured the victim. We hold that a defendant must present "some
credible evidence" on the issue involving the claimed defense in order
to merit a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of abandonment
for criminal attempt. We additionally hold that evidence showing that
the defendant injured the victim does not necessarily foreclose the
defendant\'s ability to present the abandonment defense to the jury.
Nonetheless, we agree with the court of appeals\' conclusion that here
the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative
defense of abandonment because the defendant failed to present
sufficient evidence.

**A. Section 18--2--101---Attempt Crimes**

Under section 18--2--101(1), C.R.S. (2011), a person commits criminal
attempt if "he engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward
the commission of the offense." A substantial step is any conduct "which
is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor\'s purpose to
complete the commission of the offense."

The statute goes on to provide that a defendant may assert the
affirmative defense of abandonment to the crime of attempt when the
defendant "abandon\[s\] his effort to commit the crime or otherwise
prevent\[s\] its commission \... under circumstances manifesting the
complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal intent." §
18--2--101(3).†

Thus, under the statute, though the crime of attempt is complete once
the actor takes a substantial step toward the commission of the crime,
the affirmative defense of abandonment applies if the actor completely
and voluntarily renunciates his criminal intent thereafter. §
18--2--101(1), (3).

This tension between completion by a substantial step and a subsequent
complete voluntary renunciation of criminal intent gives rise to the
issue before this Court. Though the abandonment defense "may apply at
various stages, early and late, in the commission of attempted crimes,"
it is not unlimited. Once the attempt has been completed by putting into
motion forces the actor can no longer stop, it cannot be abandoned.
Volumes of scholarly work could be devoted to the topic, but the core of
the issue before this Court is: what evidence must the defendant put
forth to raise an affirmative defense of abandonment? To address that
issue, we look to section 18--1--407, C.R.S. (2011).

**B. Section 18--1--407---Affirmative Defenses**

"The General Assembly is vested with constitutional authority not only
to define criminal conduct and to establish the legal components of
criminal liability but, as well, to delineate statutory defenses and
bars to criminal prosecution." *Lybarger v. People*, 807 P.2d 570, 580
(Colo.1991). Thus, in construing defenses to crimes, we first look to
the criminal code. Section 18--1--407(1) mandates what a defendant must
establish to raise an affirmative defense:

"Affirmative defense" means that unless the state\'s evidence raises the
issue involving the alleged defense, the defendant, to raise the issue,
shall present some credible evidence on that issue.

(emphasis added).

The "some credible evidence" standard requires little evidence for
submitting an affirmative defense to the jury. For example, in *People
v. Saavedra--Rodriguez*, 971 P.2d 223, 227--28 (Colo.1998), the Court
used the terms "a scintilla of evidence" and "\[s\]ome credible
evidence" interchangeably when considering the quantum of evidence
necessary to raise an affirmative defense of an independent intervening
act relieving the defendant of liability for criminal homicide.

The question of whether the defendant has presented "some credible
evidence" of an affirmative defense is a question of law and thus must
be resolved by the trial court. Therefore, if the trial court determines
as a matter of law that no evidence exists in the record to support an
affirmative defense, then the instruction need not be presented to the
jury because there is no issue of fact for the jury to resolve. This
Court reviews such determinations de novo.

**C. Application**

We now turn to whether the defense presented some credible evidence to
support an instruction on the affirmative defense of abandonment in the
case at hand. At the close of evidence, O\'Shaughnessy requested that
the jury be given an instruction on the affirmative defense of
abandonment which read:

It is an affirmative defense to the crime of criminal attempt that the
defendant abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevent
its commission, under circumstances manifesting the complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal intent.

O\'Shaughnessy asserts that he was entitled to the instruction with
regard to both attempted aggravated robbery and attempted first degree
murder.

**1. Attempted Aggravated Robbery**

The criminal code provides that a person is guilty of aggravated robbery
if

. . . during the act of robbery or immediate flight therefrom . . . he
knowingly wounds or strikes the person robbed . . . with a deadly weapon
or by the use of force, threats, or intimidation with a deadly weapon
knowingly puts the person robbed . . . in reasonable fear of death or
bodily injury.

§ 18--4--302(1)(b), C.R.S. (2011). The requirement of the attempt
statute quoted above, section 18--2--101, must also be met to satisfy a
charge of attempted aggravated robbery.

Here, uncontroverted evidence showed that O\'Shaughnessy knowingly
struck and wounded David in the process of attempting to rob her. He
stabbed her six times with a hunting knife while demanding money. While
doing so, he used force, threats, and intimidation by telling her she
was "going to die," while wielding the knife.

Given these undisputed facts, O\'Shaughnessy failed to present some
credible evidence that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime under
circumstances manifesting the complete and voluntary renunciation of his
criminal intent. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court\'s
determination, as a matter of law, that O\'Shaughnessy did not raise an
affirmative defense of abandonment to the charge of attempted aggravated
robbery.

**2. Attempted First Degree Murder**

O\'Shaughnessy also asserts that he was entitled to a jury instruction
on the affirmative defense of abandonment with respect to the charge of
attempted first degree murder.

O\'Shaughnessy asserts that there was some evidence in the record that
he abandoned the attempt to murder David when he stopped the assault,
asked for money, and then walked away. To the contrary, the undisputed
evidence at trial is that in the course of thirty to sixty seconds the
assailant stabbed the victim six times, including four times in and near
the throat; verbally threatened her life; and demanded money. The victim
also testified that she fought her attacker throughout the incident. In
addition, there was undisputed testimony that the defendant asked others
to lie about his whereabouts that morning and changed his appearance and
clothes immediately following the attack.

We hold that the evidence did not satisfy the threshold requirement of
some credible evidence of abandonment of attempted first degree murder.
A defendant must present some affirmative evidence of his abandonment of
the crime to raise the defense. The defendant\'s mere
withdrawal---particularly when faced with resistance by the
victim---before completing the murder or the robbery is insufficient
evidence of abandonment. Because the defendant did not present some
credible evidence of abandonment, the defendant was not entitled to a
jury instruction on an affirmative defense on that issue.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

essentially indistinguishable from the Model Penal Code position on
these points.

 

 

 

5.2.2

Mens Rea

 

As in other areas of criminal law, actus reus and mens rea work hand in
hand here. The actus reus shows us that the defendant is not just
thinking about or planning to commit a crime, but actively working to do
so. It also helps satisfy us that he has a sufficiently culpable mental
state to be convicted of the attempt. Exactly how we define that mental
state is the topic of this section.

Smallwood v. State

 

TW: Sexual Assault

 

### *Smallwood v. State*

Maryland Court of Appeals

680 A.2d 512 (App. Md.1996)

 

MURPHY, Chief Judge.

On August 29, 1991, Dwight Ralph Smallwood was diagnosed as being
infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). According to
medical records from the Prince George\'s County Detention Center, he
had been informed of his HIV-positive status by September 25, 1991. In
February 1992, a social worker made Smallwood aware of the necessity of
practicing \"safe sex\" in order to avoid transmitting the virus to his
sexual partners, and in July 1993, Smallwood told health care providers
at Children\'s Hospital that he had only one sexual partner and that
they always used condoms. Smallwood again tested positive for HIV in
February and March of 1994.

On September 26, 1993, Smallwood and an accomplice robbed a woman at
gunpoint, and forced her into a grove of trees where each man
alternately placed a gun to her head while the other one raped her. On
September 28, 1993, Smallwood and an accomplice robbed a second woman at
gunpoint and took her to a secluded location, where Smallwood inserted
his penis into her with \"slight penetration.\" On September 30, 1993,
Smallwood and an accomplice robbed yet a third woman, also at gunpoint,
and took her to a local school where she was forced to perform oral sex
on Smallwood and was raped by him. In each of these episodes, Smallwood
threatened to kill his victims if they did not cooperate or to return
and shoot them if they reported his crimes. Smallwood did not wear a
condom during any of these criminal episodes.

Based upon his attack on September 28, 1993, Smallwood was charged with,
among other crimes, attempted first-degree rape, robbery with a deadly
weapon, assault with intent to murder, and reckless endangerment. In
separate indictments, Smallwood was also charged with the attempted
second degree murder of each of his three victims. On October 11, 1994,
Smallwood pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Prince George\'s County
to attempted first-degree rape and robbery with a deadly weapon. The
circuit court also convicted Smallwood of assault with intent to murder
and reckless endangerment based upon his September 28, 1993 attack, and
convicted Smallwood of all three counts of attempted second-degree
murder.

Following his conviction, Smallwood was sentenced to concurrent
sentences of life imprisonment for attempted rape, twenty years
imprisonment for robbery with a deadly weapon, thirty years imprisonment
for assault with intent to murder, and five years imprisonment for
reckless endangerment. The circuit court also imposed a concurrent
thirty-year sentence for each of the three counts of attempted
second-degree murder. The circuit court\'s judgments were affirmed in
part and reversed in part by the Court of Special Appeals. In *Smallwood
v. State*, 106 Md.App. 1, 661 A.2d 747 (1995), the intermediate
appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient for the trial
court to conclude that Smallwood intended to kill his victims and upheld
all of his convictions.\[2\] Upon Smallwood\'s petition, we granted
certiorari to consider whether the trial court could properly conclude
that Smallwood possessed the requisite intent to support his convictions
of attempted second-degree murder and assault with intent to murder.

Smallwood asserts that the trial court lacked sufficient evidence to
support its conclusion that Smallwood intended to kill his three
victims. Smallwood argues that the fact that he engaged in unprotected
sexual intercourse, even though he knew that he carried HIV, is
insufficient to infer an intent to kill. The most that can reasonably be
inferred, Smallwood contends, is that he is guilty of recklessly
endangering his victims by exposing them to the risk that they would
become infected themselves. The State disagrees, arguing that the facts
of this case are sufficient to infer an intent to kill. The State likens
Smallwood\'s HIV-positive status to a deadly weapon and argues that
engaging in unprotected sex when one is knowingly infected with HIV is
equivalent to firing a loaded firearm at that person.

As we have previously stated, \"\[t\]he required intent in the crimes of
assault with intent to murder and attempted murder is the specific
intent to murder, i.e., the specific intent to kill under circumstances
that would not legally justify or excuse the killing or mitigate it to
manslaughter.\" Smallwood has not argued that his actions were performed
under mitigating circumstances or that he was legally justified in
attacking the three women. He was properly found guilty of attempted
murder and assault with intent to murder only if there was sufficient
evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably have concluded
that Smallwood possessed a specific intent to kill at the time he
assaulted each of the three women.

An intent to kill may be proved by circumstantial evidence. \"\[S\]ince
intent is subjective and, without the cooperation of the accused, cannot
be directly and objectively proven, its presence must be shown by
established facts which permit a proper inference of its existence.
Therefore, the trier of fact may infer the existence of the required
intent from surrounding circumstances such as \"the accused\'s acts,
conduct and words.\" As we have repeatedly stated, \"under the proper
circumstances, an intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a
deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body.\"

In *Raines*, 606 A.2d 265 (Md.,1992) we upheld the use of such an
inference. In that case, Raines and a friend were traveling on a highway
when the defendant fired a pistol into the driver\'s side window of a
tractor trailer in an adjacent lane. The shot killed the driver of the
tractor trailer, and Raines was convicted of first degree murder. The
evidence in the case showed that Raines shot at the driver\'s window of
the truck, knowing that the truck driver was immediately behind the
window. We concluded that \"Raines\'s actions in directing the gun at
the window, and therefore at the driver\'s head on the other side of the
window, permitted an inference that Raines shot the gun with the intent
to kill.\"

The State argues that our analysis in Raines rested upon two elements:
(1) Raines knew that his weapon was deadly, and (2) Raines knew that he
was firing it at someone\'s head. The State argues that Smallwood
similarly knew that HIV infection ultimately leads to death, and that he
knew that he would be exposing his victims to the risk of HIV
transmission by engaging in unprotected sex with them. Therefore, the
State argues, a permissible inference can be drawn that Smallwood
intended to kill each of his three victims. The State\'s analysis,
however, ignores several factors.

First, we must consider the magnitude of the risk to which the victim is
knowingly exposed. The inference drawn in *Raines*, supra, rests upon
the rule that \"\[i\]t is permissible to infer that \'one intends the
natural and probable consequences of his act.\'\" Before an intent to
kill may be inferred based solely upon the defendant\'s exposure of a
victim to a risk of death, it must be shown that the victim\'s death
would have been a natural and probable result of the defendant\'s
conduct. It is for this reason that a trier of fact may infer that a
defendant possessed an intent to kill when firing a deadly weapon at a
vital part of the human body. When a deadly weapon has been fired at a
vital part of a victim\'s body, the risk of killing the victim is so
high that it becomes reasonable to assume that the defendant intended
the victim to die as a natural and probable consequence of the
defendant\'s actions.

Death by AIDS is clearly one natural possible consequence of exposing
someone to a risk of HIV infection, even on a single occasion. It is
less clear that death by AIDS from that single exposure is a
sufficiently probable result to provide the sole support for an
inference that the person causing the exposure intended to kill the
person who was exposed. While the risk to which Smallwood exposed his
victims when he forced them to engage in unprotected sexual activity
must not be minimized, the State has presented no evidence from which it
can reasonably be concluded that death by AIDS is a probable result of
Smallwood\'s actions to the same extent that death is the probable
result of firing a deadly weapon at a vital part of someone\'s body.
Without such evidence, it cannot fairly be concluded that death by AIDS
was sufficiently probable to support an inference that Smallwood
intended to kill his victims in the absence of other evidence indicative
of an intent to kill.

In this case, we find no additional evidence from which to infer an
intent to kill. Smallwood\'s actions are wholly explained by an intent
to commit rape and armed robbery, the crimes for which he has already
pled guilty. For this reason, his actions fail to provide evidence that
he also had an intent to kill. As one commentator noted, in discussing a
criminal case involving similar circumstances, \"\[b\]ecause virus
transmission occurs simultaneously with the act of rape, that act alone
would not provide evidence of intent to transmit the virus. Some
additional evidence, such as an explicit statement, would be necessary
to demonstrate the actor\'s specific intent.\" Smallwood\'s knowledge of
his HIV-infected status provides the only evidence in this case
supporting a conclusion that he intended anything beyond the rapes and
robberies for which he has been convicted.

The cases cited by the State demonstrate the sort of additional evidence
needed to support an inference that Smallwood intended to kill his
victims. The defendants in these cases have either made explicit
statements demonstrating an intent to infect their victims or have taken
specific actions demonstrating such an intent and tending to exclude
other possible intents. In *State v. Hinkhouse*, 139 Or.App. 446 (1996),
for example, the defendant engaged in unprotected sex with a number of
women while knowing that he was HIV positive. The defendant had also
actively concealed his HIV-positive status from these women, had lied to
several of them by stating that he was not HIV-positive, and had refused
the women\'s requests that he wear condoms. There was also evidence that
he had told at least one of his sexual partners that \"if he were
\[HIV-\] positive, he would spread the virus to other people.\" The
Oregon Court of Appeals found this evidence to be sufficient to
demonstrate an intent to kill, and upheld the defendant\'s convictions
for attempted murder.

In *State v. Caine*, 652 So.2d 611 (La.App.), cert. denied, 661 So.2d
1358 (La.1995), a conviction for attempted second degree murder was
upheld where the defendant had jabbed a used syringe into a victim\'s
arm while shouting \"I\'ll give you AIDS.\" The defendant in *Weeks v.
State*, 834 S.W.2d 559 (Tex.App.1992), made similar statements, and was
convicted of attempted murder after he spat on a prison guard. In that
case, the defendant knew that he was HIV-positive, and the appellate
court found that \"the record reflects that \[Weeks\] thought he could
kill the guard by spitting his HIV-infected saliva at him.\" *Id.* at
562. There was also evidence that at the time of the spitting incident,
Weeks had stated that he was \"going to take someone with him when he
went,\' that he was \`medical now,\' and that he was \'HIV-4.\'\"

The evidence in *State v. Haines*, 545 N.E.2d 834 (Ind.App.1989),
contained both statements by the defendant demonstrating intent and
actions solely explainable as attempts to spread HIV. There, the
defendant\'s convictions for attempted murder were upheld where the
defendant slashed his wrists and sprayed blood from them on a police
officer and two paramedics, splashing blood in their faces and eyes. Id.
at 835. Haines attempted to scratch and bite them and attempted to force
blood-soaked objects into their faces. During this altercation, the
defendant told the officer that he should be left to die because he had
AIDS, that he wanted to \"give it to him,\" and that he would \"use his
wounds\" to spray the officer with blood. Id. Haines also \"repeatedly
yelled that he had AIDS, that he could not deal with it and that he was
going to make \[the officer\] deal with it.\" Id.

*Scroggins v. State*, 198 Ga.App. 29, 401 S.E.2d 13, 15 (1990), presents
a similar scenario, where the defendant made noises with his mouth as if
bringing up spittle and then bit a police officer hard enough to break
the skin. Immediately after this incident he informed a nurse that he
was HIV-positive and laughed when the police officer asked him if he had
AIDS. The Georgia Court of Appeals found that evidence showing that the
defendant \"sucked up excess sputum\" before biting the officer was
\"evidence of a deliberate, thinking act\" and that in conjunction with
the defendant\'s laughter when asked about AIDS, it provided sufficient
evidence of intent to support Scroggins\'s conviction for assault with
intent to kill.

In contrast with these cases, the State in this case would allow the
trier of fact to infer an intent to kill based solely upon the fact that
Smallwood exposed his victims to the risk that they might contract HIV.
Without evidence showing that such a result is sufficiently probable to
support this inference, we conclude that Smallwood\'s convictions for
attempted murder and assault with intent to murder must be reversed.

### *People v. Thomas*

Supreme Court of Colorado

729 P.2d 972 (Colo. 1986)

 

LOHR, Justice.

On the evening of February 4, 1981, the defendant received a telephone
call from a former girlfriend informing him that she had been raped in
her apartment by a man who lived in an apartment upstairs. The defendant
arrived at the woman\'s apartment shortly thereafter, armed with a
pistol. He went upstairs and gained entrance into the apartment occupied
by the alleged assailant by identifying himself as a policeman. The
defendant pointed his gun at the man who, believing the defendant was a
police officer, accompanied him back down to the woman\'s apartment. The
woman identified the man as the rapist, and the defendant instructed her
to call the police. At that time, the man started to flee to his own
apartment, and the defendant gave chase. The defendant fired three
shots, two of which struck the fleeing man. The defendant testified that
he fired the first shot as a warning when the man was going up the
stairs, that he fired a second shot accidentally when the man kicked him
while on the stairs, and that the third shot was also a warning shot,
fired from the outside of the building near the window of the apartment
occupied by the alleged rapist. When the police arrived, they found the
defendant still waiting outside, holding the gun.

The jury was instructed on the crimes of attempted first degree murder,
first degree assault, and the lesser included offenses of attempted
second degree murder, attempted reckless manslaughter, attempted heat of
passion manslaughter, and second degree assault. The jury returned
verdicts of guilty to the charges of first degree assault and attempted
reckless manslaughter, and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.

The language of the relevant statutes provides the framework for our
analysis. The crime of reckless manslaughter is defined in section
18-3-104(1)(a) C.R.S. as follows:

\(1\) A person commits the crime of manslaughter if:

\(a\) He recklessly causes the death of another person;

\"Recklessly,\" the relevant culpable mental state for this crime, is
defined in § 18-1-501(8), C.R.S. (1986):

\(8\) A person acts recklessly when he consciously disregards a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or that a
circumstance exists.

As applied to the offense of reckless manslaughter, the requisite
conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk relates to a
result, the death of another person.

The inchoate offense of criminal attempt is defined as follows in
section 18-2-101(1), C.R.S. (1986):

A person commits criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of
culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he engages
in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the
offense. A substantial step is any conduct, whether act, omission, or
possession, which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the
actor\'s purpose to complete the commission of the offense. . .

The court of appeals held that \"\[r\]ecklessness is \... a mental
culpability which is incompatible with the concept of an intentional
act.\" This is so, the court held, because the \"conscious disregard\"
with respect to risk of death that is essential to reckless manslaughter
cannot be equated with the conscious intent to cause death which the
court of appeals implicitly determined to be a necessary element of the
offense of criminal attempt in this context. On certiorari review, the
defendant supports this analysis, contending that \"\[o\]ne cannot
intend to cause a specific result \... by consciously disregarding the
risk that the result will occur.\" A careful analysis of the elements of
criminal attempt and of reckless manslaughter demonstrates, however,
that the court of appeals\' analysis and the defendant\'s supporting
arguments are misconceived.

In *People v. Frysig*, 628 P.2d 1004 (Colo.1981), we construed the
criminal attempt statute in the context of a charge of attempted first
degree sexual assault. We held that the intent to commit the underlying
offense is an essential element of the crime.

More precisely, in order to be guilty of criminal attempt, the actor
must act with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission
of the underlying offense and must engage in the conduct which
constitutes the substantial step with the further intent to perform acts
which, if completed, would constitute the underlying offense.

In order to complete the offense of reckless manslaughter, it is
necessary that the actor cause the death of another person by acting in
a manner that involves a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death of
that other person and that the actor be conscious of that risk and of
its nature when electing to act. Attempted reckless manslaughter
requires that the accused have the intent to commit the underlying
offense of reckless manslaughter. The \"intent to commit the underlying
offense\" of which *People v. Frysig* speaks is the intent to engage in
and complete the risk-producing act or conduct. It does not include an
intent that death occur even though the underlying crime, reckless
manslaughter, has death as an essential element.

The crime of attempted reckless manslaughter also requires that the
risk-producing act or conduct be commenced and sufficiently pursued to
constitute a \"substantial step toward the commission of the offense.\"
That is, the act or conduct must proceed far enough to be \"strongly
corroborative of the firmness of the actor\'s purpose,\" *Id.*, to
complete those acts that will produce a substantial and unjustifiable
risk of death of another.

Finally, in order to be guilty of attempted reckless manslaughter the
actor must engage in the requisite acts or conduct \"with the kind of
culpability otherwise required for the commission of the underlying
offense,\" that is, with a conscious disregard of a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that the acts or conduct will cause the death of
another person. Based upon this analysis, and contrary to the
defendant\'s argument, there is no logical or legal inconsistency
involved in the recognition of attempted reckless manslaughter as a
crime under the Colorado Criminal Code.

 

 

 

 

5.2.2.3

MPC Section 5.01

 

### Section 5.01. Criminal Attempt.

\(1\) Definition of Attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit
a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for
commission of the crime, he:

\(a\) purposely engages in conduct that would constitute the crime if
the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or

\(b\) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does
or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief
that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; or

\(c\) purposely does or omits to do anything that, under the
circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission
constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to
culminate in his commission of the crime.

\(2\) Conduct That May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection (1)(c).
Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under
Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of
the actor\'s criminal purpose. Without negativing the sufficiency of
other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor\'s
criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law:

\(a\) lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim
of the crime;

\(b\) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim ofthe crime
to go to the place contemplated for its commission;

\(c\) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the
crime;

\(d\) unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is
contemplated that the crime will be committed;

\(e\) possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the
crime, that are specially designed for such unlawful use or that can
serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;

 (f) possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed
in the commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for
its commission, if such possession, collection or fabrication serves no
lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;

\(g\) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an
element of the crime.

\(3\) Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime.

A person who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit a
crime that would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the
crime were committed by such other person, is guilty of an attempt to
commit the crime, although the crime is not committed or attempted by
such other person.

\(4\) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. When the actor\'s conduct would
otherwise constitute an attempt under Subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) of
this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort
to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under
circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his
criminal purpose. The establishment of such defense does not, however,
affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such
abandonment or prevention.

Within the meaning of this Article, renunciation of criminal purpose is
not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances,
not present or apparent at the inception of the actor\'s course of
conduct, that increase the probability of detection or apprehension or
that make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.
Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to
postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to
transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.

 

 

 

5.2.3

Impossibility

 

What if the defendant tried but failed to commit an offense, but was
never able to do so because of something beyond her control \-- the gun
she used wasn\'t loaded, the victim had no money to hand over, or, more
difficultly, the conduct the defendant was trying to engage in is not in
fact criminal? These questions force us to think hard about why we
punish failed attempts in the first place.

Darr v. People

 

### *Darr v. People*

Supreme Court of Colorado

568 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1977)

 

HODGES, Justice.

Defendant Darr was charged with attempted felony theft by receiving
jewelry valued at \$100 or more. See sections 18-2-101 and 18-4-401,
C.R.S. 1973. Trial was to a jury. At the close of the prosecution\'s
case, the trial court granted the defendant\'s motion for judgment of
acquittal. Pursuant to section 16-12-102, C.R.S. 1973, the district
attorney appealed to the court of appeals which disapproved the trial
court\'s ruling and judgment of acquittal

Uncontradicted evidence revealed that the jewelry which was sold to the
defendant by two policemen who represented it as being stolen, had never
been stolen. In granting the defendant\'s motion for judgment of
acquittal, the trial court ruled that the defendant had acted under a
mistake of fact and was entitled to be acquitted as a matter of law.
This trial court ruling is not in accord with the generally accepted
rule in attempt cases, and is contrary to the clear provisions of our
criminal attempt statute.

Whether the mistaken belief that goods are stolen is a defense to
attempted theft by receiving is a question of first impression in
Colorado, although appellate courts of other states have addressed it.

In the early years of this century, some jurisdictions held that the
mistaken belief that an object was stolen was a mistake of law and a
defense to attempted theft by receiving. A case frequently cited for
this holding is *People v. Jaffe*, 185 N.Y. 497 (1906). The *Jaffe*
court reasoned that because an element of the completed crime required
that the goods be stolen, the fact that the goods were not stolen was a
defense to the completed crime. Consequently, an attempt to do an act
which would not be criminal if completed could not itself be criminal
regardless of the actor\'s intent. The *Jaffe* line of cases has now
been generally rejected. The modern trend is to hold that a mistake of
fact is not a defense to attempted theft by receiving. Some courts have
undertaken to remedy the *Jaffe* rule through statutory interpretation
while other courts, including New York\'s, have requested legislative
change.

Corrective legislation usually takes a form similar to the Model Penal
Code or the New York Penal Code\'s formulations of an attempt statute.
These statutes define three elements of the offense of attempt: (1)
culpability required to commit the completed offense; (2) intent to
commit the offense; and (3) a substantial step toward completion of the
offense. Both codes specifically provide that impossibility is no
defense if a completed offense could have occurred had circumstances
been as the accused believed them to be. Commentaries accompanying each
of these sections express the opinion that the sections nullify the
Jaffe rule. We find these commentaries persuasive.

Colorado\'s attempt statute closely resembles these statutes:

"A person commits criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of
culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he
intentionally engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward
commission of the offense. . . . Factual or legal impossibility of
committing the offense is not a defense if the offense could have been
committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed
them to be . . ." § 18-2-101(1), C.R.S. 1973.

The crime which the defendant was charged with attempting was theft by
receiving:

"A person commits theft when he knowingly obtains or exercises control
over anything of value of another . . . knowing said thing of value to
have been stolen, and: (a) Intends to deprive the other person
permanently of the use or benefit of the thing of value . . ." §
18-4-401(1), C.R.S. 1973.

Here, the defendant did every act within his power to commit the offense
of theft by receiving and would have committed the completed offense had
the jewelry been stolen as he believed it to be. These acts evidenced an
intent to commit the offense, and the defendant comes within the letter
of the attempt statute. We agree with the opinion of the California
court in its leading case, *People v. Rojas*, 358 P.2d 921 (Ca. 1961):

"In our opinion, the consequences of intent and acts such as those of
defendants here should be more serious than pleased amazement that
because of the timeliness of the police the projected criminality was
not merely detected but also wiped out."

It is irrelevant whether the goods are recovered stolen goods or have
never been stolen. The intent and acts of the defendant, not the
surrounding circumstances, are the crucial elements of the attempt
offense, as the provision prohibiting the defense of impossibility for
attempt crimes makes clear.

Defendant claims that the section allowing a defense of mistake of fact
where the mistake "negatives the existence of a particular mental state
essential to commission of the offense" exculpates him. §
18-1-504(1)(a), C.R.S. 1973. Both the trial court and the court of
appeals, as well as the defendant, seemed to believe that the mistake
section and the attempt section conflict -- the first, allowing mistake
as a defense here, and the second prohibiting the defense. We disagree.

The pertinent portion of the mistake section applies only to mistakes
which "negative" the existence of a mental state essential to the
commission of an offense. The portion of the attempt statute which
provides that impossibility "is not a defense if the offense could have
been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor
believed them to be," in effect substitutes "believing" the goods to be
stolen, the element of culpability required in attempted theft by
receiving, for "knowing" the goods to be stolen, the element of
culpability for a completed theft by receiving. Here, the defendant\'s
mistake, far from negativing his belief that the goods were stolen,
established the requisite mental state. Had he not been mistaken, he
would have known that the goods were not stolen and would have lacked
the culpable mental state. The mistake section simply does not apply.

The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.

United States v. Church

 

### *United States v. Church*

US Air Force Court of Military Review

29 M.J. 679 (1989)

 

The appellant and his wife were married in 1985, and a son was born of
this union about a year later. In 1987, they experienced marital
difficulties which eventually led to their separation. By an order dated
5 October 1987, the local district court awarded custody of the child to
the appellant's wife, and shortly thereafter she returned with the child
to her home in Michigan. The appellant loved his son and desired to
regain custody of him, but began to realize it was unlikely he would be
able to do so through the courts.

\[After speaking with Airman Meyer and other co-workers, Appellant got
word to Airman Skyberg that he\] wanted to talk to him. Skyberg phoned
the appellant and asked him what he wanted to talk about. The appellant
indicated that the matter was too private to discuss over the phone, and
Skyberg arranged to meet the appellant at his dormitory room. After
Skyberg arrived, the appellant asked him if he knew anyone "who could
\[the appellant gestured with his hand, his fingers arranged as if to
simulate a gun\] his wife." The appellant indicated that he felt that
was the only way he could get custody of his son. He said he was getting
out of the service in about a month, and wanted "it" done before he left
so he would have a good alibi as to where he was at the time. Skyberg
believed the appellant was serious. A few other airmen, including Airman
Meyer, entered the room and they changed the subject of conversation.
After all had left except Skyberg and Meyer, the conversation about the
appellant's wife was resumed. The appellant talked in more detail about
the location of his wife's home in Michigan, and a hotel close by where
someone doing the job could stay. He indicated her house was up for
sale, so someone could easily get inside by posing as a prospective
buyer. He said he could provide a detailed map of the area, and would be
able to raise "a few grand" for the job. The appellant said this was not
a spur of the moment thing, but something he had been thinking about for
the last few months. Meyer indicated that he had tried to contact
someone on the appellant's behalf. After leaving the appellant's room,
Skyberg and Meyer discussed the matter further and decided to contact
the Office of Special Investigations (OSI).

After talking with Skyberg and Meyer the following day, OSI decided to
open up an investigation and attempt to place an undercover agent in the
role of a hit man. Meyer agreed to assist them by introducing the
appellant to the undercover agent. On 15 April 1988, Meyer was
instructed to contact the appellant and tell him that his \[Meyer's\]
friend in New York had found someone to do the job if the appellant was
still interested. The appellant indicated he was, and Meyer told him an
individual by the name of "Nick" (in reality, Special Agent Nicholas J.
Karnezis) would call him on the evening of 19 April. The appellant
subsequently borrowed \$400.00 from Meyer (money provided by OSI) to
help pay the hit man.

Nick called the appellant as planned, and indicated they had some
business to discuss. Nick related that he would need a picture of the
appellant's wife, a sketch of the house, and maps of the local area in
Michigan. The appellant said he already had the picture and a detailed
diagram of the residence, and that he could get the maps. Nick indicated
he would need \$500.00 up front for expenses. It was agreed they would
meet at the Holiday Inn in Fargo, North Dakota on 22 April 1988 and that
the appellant would wear an Ohio State football jacket and carry a
*Time* magazine so Nick could recognize him.

The meeting occurred as planned. After some discussion about his family
situation the appellant indicated he wanted his Wife killed. The
appellant said he had brought the things Nick had asked for and had
\$1,100.00 with him, \$500.00 for the job, plus \$600.00 for air fare.
After discussing the location of the appellant's residence, Nick
simulated a phone call to an airline ticket agent, booking a flight to
Marquette, Michigan. The appellant provided Nick with pictures of his
Wife and son; a spiral notebook containing a list of people who lived in
the house and hours they were away from home, two detailed diagrams of
the house and surrounding area, and directions on how to get to the
house from the Marquette airport; a Rand-McNally road atlas with two
different routes from the airport to the house highlighted; and, a local
Marquette area phone book, which included the phone number at his Wife's
home. They discussed the schedules of the residents, the vehicles they
drove, where the dogs were located, closets in the house where guns were
kept, and other details of the planned murder. They settled on a total
price of \$2,100.00 if the job went as easily as the appellant indicated
it should. The appellant gave Nick the \$1,100.00 he had brought with
him. Nick asked for ideas on how the killing should be done, and the
appellant said it seemed to him the easiest way was to make it look like
a robbery and that his wife got in the way. As to the weapon, he
indicated a knife or gun could be used. Nick showed the appellant a .22
caliber semi-automatic pistol, equipped with a silencer, that he had in
his brief case. Nick asked the appellant if he had any "special
requests" as to how he wanted it done. The appellant replied "one in her
head and one in her (using a slang term for a private part of the female
anatomy). Nick expressed concern about the appellant's wife's
grandfather, who also lived in the house and did not work. The appellant
indicated there should be no witnesses, and that if the grandfather got
in the way Nick should take care of him too. The appellant indicated he
wanted the job done while he was at work S0 he would be very visible. He
provided Nick with his work and dormitory phone numbers, and Nick said
he would be in touch, and for the appellant to expect a call around 8:00
to 8:30

Nick called the appellant from K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, Michigan (a
base located close to Marquette) on 24 April. He told the appellant that
his wife had moved, and that the job would cost more, another \$500.00,
since he would have to locate where she was living. The appellant agreed
to pay the additional amount. That evening the appellant asked Airman
Meyer to call directory assistance in Michigan for him to find out his
wife's new phone number. Meyer did, and gave the new number to the
appellant. (A fair inference is that the appellant obtained the number
so he could provide it to Nick if Nick was unable to locate the
appellant's wife on his own.) Nick called again the following day,
indicating he had located the appellant's wife and that the job would be
done between then and the following morning. The appellant said that was
fine. He indicated he had the other \$1,000.00, but that it would take a
little longer to come up with the additional \$500.00.

On the morning of 26 April, the appellant was notified of his wife's
death by his unit commander. According to Airman Meyer, the appellant
told him that everyone was sympathetic and that the appellant put on "a
Class A act," including crying and laying down on the first sergeant's
couch. Later that day, the appellant received a message to meet Nick
down in Fargo. He proceeded to the Holiday Inn in Fargo. He told Nick he
had received notification of his wife's death. Nick said: "You mean you
got the word already!" And the appellant replied: "You do good work."
Nick showed the appellant a picture of his wife laying on the floor with
what appeared to be two bullet wounds, one in her head and another in
her neck. The appellant confirmed that it was his Wife. After some
further discussion, he gave Nick \$1,000.00. At that point Nick
identified himself as a government agent and apprehended the appellant.
The two meetings between- the appellant and Nick at the Holiday Inn were
both video and audio tape recorded (the tapes were admitted in evidence
at trial). 

## An Attempt or Only a Solicitation?

On the appellant's behalf, it is forcefully argued that his conduct
never passed the threshold from mere preparation (i.e., a solicitation)
to an attempt to commit the offense because there was no "dangerous
proximity" to success of the planned murder. Since there is little
military authority on point, appellate counsel rely principally on state
court approaches to this dilemma. In various factual situations
involving "contracting out" for crimes, these courts held that the
evidence only established mere acts of preparation not leading directly
or proximately to consummation of the intended crime. For example, in
Adami the Court concluded that "the contemplated murder would not have
resulted in the usual course of natural events since neither the 'agent'
nor the solicitor \[defendant\] did any unequivocal overt act which can
be said to be a commencement of the commission of the intended crime."
*People v. Adami*, 111 Ca1.Rptr. at 548.

Typical, and perhaps closest factually to the present appellant's case,
are the companion cases of *Davis* and *Lourie*. They involved a plan
hatched by two lovers to murder the woman's husband (Edmon Lourie) so
that they could get his life insurance amounting to \$66,000.00. The
parties resided in Kansas City, Missouri. In furtherance of their plan,
Davis engaged a man named Leverton to find an ex­-convict who would
commit the murder for hire. However, Leverton disclosed the plot to the
police. Thereafter, several meetings were held between Davis, Leverton
and an undercover police officer, Dill. It was agreed that Dill would
kill Mr. Lourie for \$600.00 and diamonds valued at about \$3,000.00
owned by the Louries. Also, arrangements were made for Dill to meet Mrs.
Lourie so they would be able to recognize each other. It was decided
that the contemplated assault would occur in Chicago, where Mr. Lourie
had gone on business. Davis provided Dill a map showing where Mr. Lourie
could be located and two photos of him. If Dill could not locate him,
Mrs. Lourie would also travel to Chicago to assist. However, this part
of the plan was interrupted when Mr. Lourie returned early from his
trip. It was then decided that Mrs. Lourie would persuade her husband to
go out for a night on the town, and that they would leave their home at
8:00 p.m. on a certain date. Mrs. Lourie was to have the diamonds on her
person so it would appear that robbery was the motive for the crime. She
would be "mussed up", and then faint, permitting Dill time to escape. On
the evening in question, Dill, accompanied by three other police
officers, proceeded to the Lourie residence as planned. The Louries were
dressed and ready to leave; Mrs. Lourie had the diamonds on her person.
Davis, also as planned, was at home in another part of the city in order
to have an alibi. Two of the officers entered the residence and took
charge of the Louries, while Dill and the other officer proceeded to
Davis' residence and arrested him. The Supreme Court of Missouri
concluded:

The employment of Dill as agent to murder Lourie was not tantamount to
an attempt. Dill not only had no intention of carrying out the expressed
purpose of defendant, but was guilty of no act directly or indirectly
moving toward the consummation of the intended crime.  He did nothing
more than listen to the plans and solicitations of defendant without
intending to act upon them. It was not shown that Dill committed an act
that could be construed as an attempt. The arrest of Lourie, his wife,
and defendant as detailed in the evidence could not be said to be an act
involving the consummation of the crime. (Citations omitted.)

*State v. Davis*, 6 S.W.2d at 612. The Court adopted the same rationale
in its decision in *State v. Laurie*. The Court acknowledged that the
defendants were guilty of soliciting another to commit murder, a crime
not charged. (Apparently under Missouri law that offense is not a lesser
included offense to murder or attempted murder.)

Not all authority favors the defense position. A few state courts have
upheld attempt convictions in cases involving crimes for hire. These
cases stand for the proposition that once the intent that a crime be
committed is clearly proved, "slight acts" on the part of the solicitor
will support an attempt conviction.

 To a great extent, resolution of the issue we face is dependent upon
the facts of the case. We hold that under the circumstances present in
the case now before us, the appellant's conviction of attempted murder
can be sustained. We have found no military or federal precedent which
we believe would require us to reach the opposite conclusion.

As this Court has recently stated, "a criminal attempt attaches
culpability to a state of mind consisting of an accused's criminal
intent and the belief that he is acting in such a manner as to achieve
that intent." In *United States v. Byrd*, 24 M.J. 286, 290 (C.M.A.
1987), the United States Court of Military Appeals relied upon a test
adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:

\[T\]o be guilty of an attempt, a 'defendant must have engaged in
conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the
crime' and that substantial step must be conduct strongly corroborative
of the firmness of the defendant's criminal intent. 

## Conclusion

 \[W\]e are convinced that the trial court's findings of guilty of the
offense of attempted murder should be upheld. The appellant's conduct in
obtaining the services of Nicholas Karnezis to murder his wife, his
detailed participation in planning the intended crime, up to advising
the agent exactly how he wanted his wife shot, and his payment of the
agreed upon consideration, both before the crime was to occur and after
he was apprised that it had, constitutes "a substantial step toward
commission of the crime," and establishes the requisite overt act
amounting to more than mere preparation. We can envision nothing else
the appellant could possibly have done to effect what he believed would
be his wife\'s murder, short of committing the act himself (which is
precisely what he did not want to do). As characterized by appellate
government counsel during oral argument, the appellant armed a missile
(Nick) and fired it off, fully believing it was aimed directly at his
intended victim. If we were to accept the reasoning of appellate defense
counsel neither appellant nor SA Karnezis ever took any steps or
perpetration in dangerous proximity to the commission of the offense
planned" because the agent never intended to commit the offense. No
contract for hire criminal scheme could ever be prosecuted as an attempt
if the person hired turned out to be a government agent or informant. To
place our criminal justice system in this posture defies logic. It is
the accused's criminal intent we are concerned with, not that of the
person hired to commit the crime.

Turning to that intent, we find the record replete with evidence
establishing "conduct strongly corroborative of the firmness of the
defendant's criminal intent." The appellant retained whom he believed to
be a big city hit man for the purpose of murdering his wife; he paid an
agreed upon amount of money up front; he provided photographs, documents
and diagrams to facilitate commission of the crime; he helped plan
precisely how it would be committed; he indicated the need for an alibi
for himself; after being advised that his wife had moved, he agreed to
an increase in the contract price and obtained her new telephone number;
when notified of her murder through unit channels, he "put on a Class A
act;" upon being shown a staged picture of his wife with gunshot wounds,
he commended Nick for his "good work," and paid a further installment on
the contract price. The firmness of his intent is clearly established.

We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty
of attempted murder.

People v. Grizzle

 

### *People v. Grizzle*

Colorado Court of Appeals

140 P.3d 224 (Colo. App. 2006)

 

ROY, J.

Defendant, David Barchlotte Grizzle, appeals the judgment of conviction
entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count of attempted
sexual assault on a child, § 18--3--405(1), C.R.S. (2005), and one count
of enticement of a child, § 18--3--305(1), C.R.S. (2005). Defendant was
sentenced to ninety days in jail and ten years probation. We affirm.

The events giving rise to the charges commenced on or about the time
that defendant made contact in an Internet chat room with a person
claiming to be a thirteen-year-old girl. However, the person he
contacted was actually an adult male deputy sheriff. Over the course of
several weeks, the parties exchanged photographs and defendant spoke on
the phone several times with a female deputy substituting for the male
deputy. The subject in the photographs that defendant received was, in
fact, a youthful-looking but obviously adult female deputy sheriff. The
nature of the correspondence was often sexually explicit with defendant
going so far as to expose himself and masturbate in front of a camera
that transmitted live images over the Internet. Defendant was then
invited to a rendezvous at an apartment purportedly occupied by the
victim, and he was arrested upon his arrival.

At trial, defendant denied any wrongdoing. He testified that (1) he
never believed the victim to be thirteen years old but thought that she
was in her early twenties; (2) during his exchanges with her, defendant
was just playing along as flirtation and part of a fantasy; and (3) his
past experiences with Internet communication and chat rooms led him to
believe that most participants created fake profiles, used fake names,
and sent out fake pictures as occurred here. Throughout his testimony,
he adamantly maintained that he believed, certainly after he was
provided with photographs, that he was, in fact, communicating and
agreeing to meet with an adult. The prosecution\'s theory, based on the
extended communications between defendant and the "victim" over the
Internet, was that defendant went to the rendezvous with the intent to
have a sexual liaison with a child.

As tried, the case turned on the credibility of the witnesses,
particularly defendant. If the jurors believed him, they presumably
would have acquitted. If the jurors accepted the prosecution\'s theory
they would, as they did, convict.

A defendant is guilty of sexual assault on a child when he or she
"knowingly subjects another not his or her spouse to any sexual contact
\... if the victim is less than fifteen years of age and the actor is at
least four years older than the victim." Section 18--3--405(1).

A defendant is guilty of enticement of a child "if he or she invites or
persuades, or attempts to invite or persuade, a child under the age of
fifteen years to enter any vehicle, building, room, or secluded place
with the intent to commit sexual assault or unlawful sexual contact upon
said child." Section 18--3--305(1) (emphasis added); See *People v.
Black*, 759 P.2d 746 (Colo.App.1988) (the crime of enticement of a child
is complete if the defendant acted with the intent to cause a sexual
assault on a child even though he was unable to complete it). The jury
was instructed on attempt to entice a child as provided in §
18--3--305(1).

Section 18--2--101(1), C.R.S. (2005), which defines "criminal attempt,"
states:

A person commits criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of
culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he engages
in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the
offense. A substantial step is any conduct, whether act, omission, or
possession, which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the
actor\'s purpose to complete the commission of the offense. Factual or
legal impossibility of committing the offense is not a defense if the
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been
as the actor believed them to be, nor is it a defense that the crime
attempted was actually perpetrated by the accused.

When the object of an attempt to sexually assault or entice is an
existing person under the age of fifteen years, the belief that the
person is over the age of fifteen years is irrelevant. Section
18--1--503.5(3), C.R.S. (2005) ("\[i\]f the criminality of conduct
depends on a child being younger than fifteen years of age, it shall be
no defense that the defendant did not know the child\'s age or that the
defendant reasonably believed the child to be fifteen years of age or
older").

However, when, as here, there is no "real" person, a defendant\'s belief
as to the age of the person with whom he attempts to engage in sexual
activities is not only relevant but central to the inquiry. For
instance, if a defendant believed that he or she was going to meet an
adult for the purposes of having a sexual liaison, no crime is
implicated because there is no "real" victim and if matters were as the
defendant believed, there is not, without more, a crime. If, however, a
defendant believed that the person with whom he or she had arranged a
sexual liaison was under the age of fifteen, then he or she could be
guilty of criminal attempt even when there is a nonexistent victim.
*Cf.* § 18--2--101, C.R.S. (2005) (factual impossibility is not a
defense if the offense could have been committed had the attendant
circumstances been as the defendant believed them to be).

\[The Court then concluded that the defendant was not entitled to an
"entrapment" instruction because the government sting merely provided
the opportunity for Grizzle to commit the crime, it did not entice him
to commit the crime. Furthermore, the entrapment instruction is only
available when one admits the elements of the offense, something Grizzle
refused to do.\]

The judgment is affirmed.

 

 

 

5.2.3.4

Note on Grizzle

 

### Note on Grizzle

Is this case one of impossibility or of two separate, incompatible
stories? The appellate court stated that the jury believed the
government's story -- that Grizzle believed he was meeting someone under
age -- rather than Grizzle's -- that he was meeting an adult who had
been passing herself off online as a minor.

Undercover sting operations of the type discussed in Grizzle raise
difficult questions regarding attempt and impossibility. Because there
was never any actual risk of a child being harmed in this case, it is
worth considering whether *either* the actus reus or mens rea of an
attempt were satisfied here. Certainly, under the dangerous proximity
test, Grizzle did not get close to completing an attempt. And, at least
under his version of the events, he did not demonstrate unequivocally
his intent to harm a child.

Accountability for the Acts of Others

 

In this section, we investigate whether and to what extent one person
can be held responsible for the crimes committed by another. That is, we
ask whether one who helps or asks another to commit an offense can be
held liable if that person does so. What do we hope to gain by punishing
not just the person committing an offense, but also those who encouraged
or helped them do so?

 

 

 

 

6.1

Accomplice Liability

 

Most of the cases we have studied have involved only one criminal, and
we have considered the culpability only of the principal actor
committing the crime. In reality, however, many crimes implicate
multiple people. Complicity (or accomplice liability or aiding and
abetting liability) is not itself a crime; rather, it is a theory of
liability whereby a person can be criminally liable as an accomplice. In
aiding a person who commits a crime, an accomplice becomes personally
liable for the other person's crime. How far should such liability
extend? To specifically intended results, to foreseeable results, or to
all results that may occur? As you read these cases, note not only when
courts attach accomplice liability, but also how far that liability
extends.

 

 

 

 

6.1.1

Hicks v. United States

 

### *Hicks v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

150 US 442 (1893)

 

MR. JUSTICE SHIRAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of
Arkansas, John Hicks, an Indian, was jointly indicted with Stand Rowe,
also an Indian, for the murder of Andrew J. Colvard, a white man, by
shooting him with a gun on the 13th of February, 1892. Rowe was killed
by the officers in the attempt to arrest him, and Hicks was tried
separately, and found guilty, in March, 1893. We adopt the statement of
the facts in the case made in the brief for the government as correct
and as sufficient for our purposes:

\"It appears that on the night of the 12th of February, 1892, there was
a dance at the house of Jim Rowe, in the Cherokee Nation; that Jim Rowe
was a brother to Stand Rowe, who was indicted jointly with the
defendant; that a large number of men and women were in attendance; that
the dance continued until near sunrise the morning of the 13th; that
Stand Rowe and the defendant were engaged in what was called
\'scouting,\' viz., eluding the United States marshals who were in
search of them with warrants for their arrest, and were armed for the
purpose of resisting arrest. They appeared at the dance, each armed with
a Winchester rifle. They were both Cherokee Indians. The deceased,
Andrew J. Colvard, was a white man who had married a Cherokee woman. He
had been engaged in the mercantile business in the Cherokee country
until a few months before the homicide. He came to the dance on
horseback on the evening of the 12th. A good deal of whisky was drunk
during the night by the persons present, and Colvard appears to have
been drunk at some time during the night. Colvard spoke Cherokee
fluently, and appears to have been very friendly with Stand Rowe and the
defendant Hicks.\"

\"On the morning of the 13th, as the party were dispersing, Colvard
invited Stand Rowe and Hicks to go home with him, and repeated
frequently this invitation. Finally he offered as an inducement to Stand
Rowe, if he would accompany him home, to give him a suit of clothes, and
a hat and boots. The urgency of these invitations appears to have
excited the suspicion of the defendant in error, who declared openly
that if Colvard persisted in his effort to take Stand Rowe away with
him, he would shoot him.\"

\"Sometime after sunrise on the morning of the 13th, about 7 o\'clock,
S. J. Christian, Benjamin F. Christian, Wm. J. Murphy, and Robert
Murphy, all of whom had been at the dance the night before and had seen
there Colvard, Stand Rowe, and the defendant, were standing on the porch
of the house of William J. Murphy, about 414 steps west from the house
of Jim Rowe, and saw Stand Rowe, coming on horseback in a moderate walk,
with his Winchester rifle lying down in front of him, down a \'trail\'
which led into the main traveled road. Before Stand Rowe appeared in
sight, the men who were on the porch had heard a \'whoop\' in the
direction from which Stand Rowe came, and this \'whoop\' was responded
to by one from the main road in the direction of Jim Rowe\'s house.
Stand Rowe halted within five or six feet of the main road, and the men
on the porch saw Mr. Colvard and the defendant Hicks riding together
down the main road from the direction of Jim Rowe\'s house.\"

\"As Colvard and Hicks approached the point where Stand Rowe was sitting
on his horse, Stand Rowe rode out into the road and halted. Colvard then
rode up to him in a lope or canter, leaving Hicks, the defendant, some
30 or 40 feet in his rear. The point where the three men were together
on their horses was about 100 yards from where the four witnesses stood
on the porch. The conversation between the three men on horseback was
not fully heard by the four men on the porch, and all that was heard was
not understood, because part of it was carried on in the Cherokee
tongue; but some part of this conversation was distinctly heard and
clearly understood by these witnesses. They saw Stand Rowe twice raise
his rifle and aim it at Colvard, and twice he lowered it. They heard
Colvard say, \'I am a friend to both of you.\' They saw and heard the
defendant Hicks laugh aloud when Rowe directed his rifle towards
Colvard. They saw Hicks take off his hat, and hit his horse on the neck
or shoulder with it. They heard Hicks say to Colvard, \'Take off your
hat, and die like a man\'; they saw Stand Rowe raise his rifle for the
third time point it at Colvard and fire it; they saw Colvard\'s horse
wheel and run back in the direction of Jim Rowe\'s house, 115 or 116
steps; they saw Colvard fall from his horse; they went to where he was
lying in the road, and found him dead; they saw Stand Rowe and John
Hicks ride off together after the shooting.\"

Hicks testified on his own behalf, denying that he had encouraged Rowe
to shoot Colvard, and alleging that he had endeavored to persuade Rowe
not to shoot.

The language attributed to Hicks, and which he denied having used,
cannot be said to have been entirely free from ambiguity. It was
addressed not to Rowe, but to Colvard. Hicks testified that Rowe was in
a dangerous mood, and that he did not know whether he would shoot
Colvard or Hicks. The remark made \-- if made \-- accompanied with the
gesture of taking off his own hat, may have been an utterance of
desperation, occasioned by his belief that Rowe would shoot one or both
of them. That Hicks and Rowe rode off together after seeing Colvard fall
was used as a fact against Hicks, pointing to a conspiracy between them.
Hicks testified that he did it in fear of his life; that Rowe had
demanded that he should show him the road which he wished to travel.
Hicks further testified \-- and in this he was not contradicted \-- that
he separated from Rowe a few minutes afterwards, on the first
opportunity, and that he never afterwards had any intercourse with him,
nor had he been in the company of Rowe for several weeks before the
night of the fatal occurrence.

Two of the assignments of error are especially relied on by the counsel
of the accused. One arises out of that portion of the charge wherein the
judge sought to instruct the jury as to the evidence relied on as
showing that Hicks aided and abetted Rowe in the commission of the
crime.

We agree with the counsel for the plaintiff in error in thinking that
this instruction was erroneous in two particulars. It omitted to
instruct the jury that the acts or words of encouragement and abetting
must have been used by the accused with the intention of encouraging and
abetting Rowe. So far as the instruction goes, the words may have been
used for a different purpose, and yet have had the actual effect of
inciting Rowe to commit the murderous act. Hicks, indeed, testified that
the expressions used by him were intended to dissuade Rowe from
shooting. But the jury were left to find Hicks guilty as a principal
because the effect of his words may have had the result of encouraging
Rowe to shoot, regardless of Hicks\' intention. In another part of the
charge, the learned judge did make an observation as to the question of
intention in the use of the words, saying:

\"If the deliberate and intentional use of words has the effect to
encourage one man to kill another, he who uttered these words is
presumed by the law to have intended that effect, and is responsible
therefor.\"

This statement is itself defective in confounding the intentional use of
the words with the intention as respects the effect to be produced.
Hicks no doubt intended to use the words he did use, but did he thereby
intend that they were to be understood by Rowe as an encouragement to
act? However this may be, we do not think this expression of the learned
judge availed to cure the defect already noticed in his charge \-- that
the mere use of certain words would suffice to warrant the jury in
finding Hicks guilty, regardless of the intention with which they were
used.

Another error is contained in that portion of the charge now under
review, and that is the statement:

\"that, if Hicks was actually present at that place at the time of the
firing by Stand Rowe, and he was there for the purpose of either aiding,
abetting, advising, or encouraging the shooting of Andrew J. Colvard by
Stand Rowe, and that, as a matter of fact, he did not do it, but was
present for the purpose of aiding or abetting or advising or encouraging
his shooting, but he did not do it because it was not necessary, it was
done without his assistance, the law says there is a third condition
where guilt is fastened to his act in that regard.\"

We understand this language to mean that where an accomplice is present
for the purpose of aiding and abetting in a murder, but refrains from so
aiding and abetting because it turned out not to be necessary for the
accomplishment of the common purpose, he is equally guilty as if he had
actively participated by words or acts of encouragement. Thus
understood, the statement might in some instances be a correct
instruction. Thus, if there had been evidence sufficient to show that
there had been a previous conspiracy between Rowe and Hicks to waylay
and kill Colvard, Hicks, if present at the time of the killing, would be
guilty even if it was found unnecessary for him to act. But the error of
such an instruction in the present case is in the fact that there was no
evidence on which to base it. The evidence, so far as we are permitted
to notice it, as contained in the bills of exception and set forth in
the charge shows no facts from which the jury could have properly found
that the encounter was the result of any previous conspiracy or
arrangement. The jury might well therefore have thought that they were
following the court\'s instructions in finding the accused guilty
because he was present at the time and place of the murder, although he
contributed neither by word nor action to the crime, and although there
was no substantial evidence of any conspiracy or prior arrangement
between him and Rowe.

The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded,
with directions to set aside the verdict and award a new trial.

LORD GODDARD, C.J.: This is a case stated by the metropolitan magistrate
at Bow Street Magistrate's Court before whom the appellant, Herbert
William Wilcox, the proprietor of a periodical called \"Jazz
Illustrated," was charged on an information that "on Dec. 11, 1949, he
did unlawfully aid and abet one Coleman Hawkins in contravening art. 1
(4) of the Aliens Order, 1920, by failing to comply with a condition
attached to a grant of leave to land, to wit, that the said Coleman
Hawkins should take no employment paid or unpaid while in the United
Kingdom, contrary to art. 18 (2) of the Aliens Order, 1920."

The case is concerned with the visit of a celebrated professor of the
saxophone, a gentleman by the name of Hawkins who was a citizen of the
United States. He came here at the invitation of two gentlemen of the
name of Curtis and Hughes, connected with a jazz club which enlivens the
neighbourhood of Willesden. They, apparently, had applied for permission
for Mr. Hawkins land and it was refused, but, nevertheless, this
professor of the saxophone arrived with four French musicians. When they
came to the airport, among the people who were there to greet them was
the appellant. He had not arranged their visit, but he knew they were
coming and he was there to report the arrival of these important
musicians for his magazine. So, evidently, he was regarding the visit of
Mr. Hawkins as a matter which would be of interest to himself and the
magazine which he was editing and selling for profit. Messrs. Curtis and
Hughes arranged a concert at the Princes Theatre, London. The appellant
attended that concert as a spectator. He paid for his ticket. Mr.
Hawkins went on the stage and delighted the audience by playing the
saxophone. The appellant did not get up and protest in the name of the
musicians of England that Mr. Hawkins ought not to be here competing
with them and taking the bread out of their mouths or the wind out of
their instruments. It is not found that he actually applauded, but he
was there having paid to go in, and, no doubt, enjoying the performance,
and then, lo and behold, out comes his magazine with a most, laudatory
description, fully illustrated, of this concert. On those facts the
magistrate has found that he aided and abetted.

Reliance is placed by the prosecution on *R. v. Coney* (1) which dealt
with a prize fight. This case relates to a jazz band concert, but the
particular nature of the entertainment provided, whether by fighting
with bare fists or playing on saxophones, does not seem to me to make
any difference to the question which we have to decide. The fact is that
a man is charged with aiding and abetting an illegal act, and I can find
no authority for saying that it matters what that illegal act is,
provided that the aider and abettor knows the facts sufficiently well to
know that they would constitute an offence in the principal. In *R. v.
Coney* (1) the prize fight took place in the neighbourhood of Ascot, and
four or five men were convicted of aiding and abetting the fight. The
conviction was quashed on the ground that the chairman had not given a
correct direction to the jury when he told them that, as the prisoners
were physically present at the fight, they must be held to have aided
and abetted. That direction, the court held, was wrong, it being too
wide. The matter was very concisely put by CAVE, J., whose judgment was
fully concurred in by that great master of the criminal law, STEPHEN, J.
CAVE, J., said (8 Q.B.D. 540):

\"Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence of
aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental it is
evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury."

There was not accidental presence in this case. The appellant paid to go
to the concert and he went there because he wanted to report it. He
must, therefore, be held to have been present, taking part, concurring,
or encouraging, whichever word you like to use for expressing this
conception. It was an illegal act on the part of Hawkins to play the
saxophone or any other instrument at this concert. The appellant clearly
knew that it was an unlawful act for him to play. He had gone there to
hear him, and his presence and his payment to go there was an
encouragement. He went there to make use of the performance, because he
went there, as the magistrate finds and was justified in finding, to get
\"copy\" for his newspaper. It might have been entirely different, as I
say, if he had gone there and protested, saying: "The musicians' union
do not like you foreigners coming here and playing and you ought to get
off the stage.\" If he had booed, it might have been some evidence that
he was not aiding and abetting. If he had gone as a member of a *claque*
to try to drown the noise of the saxophone, he might very likely be
found not guilty of aiding and abetting. In this case it seems clear
that he was there, not only to approve and encourage what was done, but
to take advantage of it by getting \"copy\" for his paper. In those
circumstances there was evidence on which the magistrate could find that
the appellant aided and abetted, and for these reasons I am of opinion
that the appeal fails.

Note on Wilcox v. Jeffery

 

### Note on Wilcox v. Jeffery and bystander liability

Wilcox raises questions we considered very early in the semester
regarding liability for omissions. The court seems to imply that Wilcox
wouldn't have been liable if he had gone to the show and booed Hawkins
for taking the jobs of hardworking English jazz musicians. So is he
liable for not booing? Did he have an obligation to boo?

A far more serious issue regarding presence and accomplice liability is
presented in the movie The Accused, a fictional account of a brutal
sexual assault that occurred in a New Bedford, Massachusetts bar in
1983. In addition to the four men who carried out that assault, two
patrons were prosecuted for aiding and abetting it by cheering the
attackers on. Those two men were acquitted at trial; the attackers were
convicted. The incident and the subsequent trial are also the subject of
Netflix recent crime anthology series [Trial by
Media](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81025113?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C4%2C3ea89bf7-d93a-47c3-b58c-587077287a18-536876769%2Cd7d3fd5f613b5668299a760a5bb9bb444f52f0e0%3A2f7c334c96031e5da78b7b6d6d2fb27147d284ba%2C%2C).

On what basis should aiding and abetting liability be imposed in such a
situation? For remaining present and not objecting? For leaving and not
going to the authorities? Recall that the general American rule is to
not impose liability for an omission in the absence of a preexisting
legal duty to aid.

Does such a standard make sense in this context?

 

 

 

6.1.3.3

Hypothetical Based on ex rel. Attorney General v. Tally, Judge

 

*State ex rel. Attorney General v. Tally, Judge*, 15 So. 722 (Ala. 1894)
was an action brought against an Alabama judge for facilitating the four
Skelton brothers in pursuing and ultimately killing a man named Ross
after Ross ran off with their sister (Tally's sister-in-law). The
brothers pursued Ross to a neighboring town intending to kill him and,
upon learning this, a friend of Ross' tried to warn him by telegram.
Tally then sent his own telegram to the telegraph operator, asking him
not to deliver the warning message. The operator in fact did not deliver
the message; the Skeltons caught up with Ross and killed him.

Tally was charged with aiding and abetting the killing of Ross and the
Alabama High Court upheld the conviction. The Court held that it was not
necessary to show that Tally's telegram was even the but-for cause of
Ross's death:

The assistance given... need not contribute to the criminal result in
the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite
sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without
it. It is quite enough if the aid merely renders it easier for the
principal actor to accomplish the end intend by him and the aider and
abettor, though in all human probability the end would have been
attained without it.

Is this result consistent with the court's opinion in *Wilcox v.
Jeffery*?

With these results in mind, consider the following variations on the
facts of Tally. What result would we get under the traditional common
law approach? Under MPC §2.06?

1.  Due to a technical glitch, the judge's telegram never reached the
    nearby town and the telegraph operator tried in vain to deliver the
    warning to Ross. However, by the time he found Ross, the Skeltons
    had already found and killed him.

2.  The telegraph operator received Tally's request and did not deliver
    the warning telegram, but the Skeltons never found Ross and he
    escaped town without incident.

3.  Same as 2), above, except that the Skeltons *did* find Ross who
    managed to fight them off and escape town unscathed.

State v. Gladstone

 

### *State v. Gladstone*

Supreme Court of Washington

474 P.2d 274 (Wash. 1970)

 

ALE, J.

A jury found defendant Bruce Gladstone guilty of aiding and abetting one
Robert Kent in the unlawful sale of marijuana. Deferring imposition of
sentence, the court placed defendant on probation. He appeals the order
deferring sentencing contending that the evidence as a matter of law was
insufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. His point, we think, is
well taken.

One who aids or abets another in the commission of a crime is guilty as
a principal under RCW 9.01.030, which says:

Every person concerned in the commission of a felony, gross misdemeanor
or misdemeanor, whether he directly commits the act constituting the
offense, or aids or abets in its commission, and whether present or
absent; and every person who directly or indirectly counsels,
encourages, hires, commands, induces or otherwise procures another to
commit a felony, gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor, is a principal, and
shall be proceeded against and punished as such. The fact that the
person aided, abetted, counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced
or procured, could not or did not entertain a criminal intent, shall not
be a defense to any person aiding, abetting, counseling, encouraging,
hiring, commanding, inducing or procuring him.

Gladstone\'s guilt as an aider and abettor in this case rests solely on
evidence of a conversation between him and one Douglas MacArthur
Thompson concerning the possible purchase of marijuana from one Robert
Kent. There is no other evidence to connect the accused with Kent who
ultimately sold some marijuana to Thompson.

When asked by Thompson an agent of the police where marijuana could be
bought, the defendant did no more than name Kent as an individual who
might be willing to sell some and draw a sketch of his location. There
was no evidence whatever that the defendant had any association,
understanding, agreement or arrangement, direct or indirect, tacit or
express with Kent to aid or persuade him in any way in the sale of
marijuana.

The conversation between defendant and Thompson occurred at defendant\'s
residence. Douglas MacArthur Thompson, a 25-year-old student at the
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma and an employee of the Internal
Revenue Service of the United States, had done some investigative work
for the government. From time to time, the Tacoma Police Department
engaged him to investigate the use, possession and sale of narcotics,
principally marijuana, among college students. When working for the
Tacoma Police Department, he operated under the control and direction of
the department\'s narcotics detail.

Thompson testified that Lieutenant Seymour and Detective Gallwas of the
narcotics detail asked him to attempt purchase of marijuana from
Gladstone. During the evening of April 10, 1967 between 10 and 11
o\'clock the two officers and Thompson drove in a police car to the
vicinity of defendant\'s apartment. Thompson went to Gladstone\'s door
alone, beyond the hearing and out of the sight of the two officers. He
knocked at the door and Gladstone responded. Thompson asked Gladstone if
he would sell him some marijuana. Describing this incident, Thompson
testified as follows:

Well, I asked at the time Gladstone told me that he was he did not have
enough marijuana on hand to sell me any, but he did know an individual
who had quite a sufficient quantity and that was very willing to sell
and he named the individual as Robert Kent, or Bob Kent as he put it,
and he gave me directions to the residence and he due to the directions
I asked him if, you know, if he could draw me a map and he did.

When Thompson said he asked Gladstone to draw the map for him, he added,
\"I\'m not sure whether he did give me the exact address or not, he told
me where the residence was.\" He said that Gladstone then with pencil
and paper sketched the location of Kent\'s place of residence. Thompson
had no prior knowledge of where Kent lived, and did not know if he might
have marijuana or that he had ever possessed it.

The two officers then took Thompson to Kent\'s residence where marijuana
was purchased. The actual purchase was made by Thompson directly from
Kent while Officer Gallwas and Lieutenant Seymour stayed in the police
car. Kent was subsequently arrested and convicted of selling Thompson
approximately 8 ounces of marijuana the very sale which defendant here
was convicted of aiding and abetting.

That ended the prosecution\'s case. Even if it were accorded all
favorable inferences, there appears at this point a gap in the evidence
which we feel as a matter of law is fatal to the prosecution\'s cause.
Neither on direct examination nor under cross-examination did Thompson
testify that he knew of any prior conduct, arrangements or
communications between Gladstone and Kent from which it could be even
remotely inferred that the defendant had any understanding, agreement,
purpose, intention or design to participate or engage in or aid or abet
any sale of marijuana by Kent. Other than to obtain a simple map from
Gladstone and to say that Gladstone told him Kent might have some
marijuana available, Thompson did not even establish that Kent and the
defendant were acquainted with each other. Testimony of the brief
conversation and Gladstone\'s very crude drawing consisting of 8
penciled lines indicating where Kent lived constitute the whole proof of
the aiding and abetting presented.

If all reasonable inferences favorable to the state are accorded the
evidence, it does not, in our opinion, establish the commission of the
crime charged. That vital element a nexus between the accused and the
party whom he is charged with aiding and abetting in the commission of a
crime is missing. The record contains no evidence whatever that
Gladstone had any communication by word, gesture or sign, before or
after he drew the map, from which it could be inferred that he
counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced or procured Kent to
sell marijuana to Douglas Thompson as charged, or took any steps to
further the commission of the crime charged. He was not charged with
aiding and abetting Thompson in the purchase of marijuana, but with
Kent\'s sale of it.

Gladstone\'s culpability, if at all, must be brought within RCW
9.01.030, which makes a principal of one who aids and abets another in
the commission of the crime. Although an aider and abettor need not be
physically present at the commission of the crime to be held guilty as a
principal, his conviction depends on proof that he did something in
association or connection with the principal to accomplish the crime.
Learned Hand, J., we think, hit the nail squarely when, in *United
States v. Peoni*, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938), he wrote that, in
order to aid and abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that a
defendant

. . . in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he
participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he
seek by his action to make it succeed. All the words used even the most
colorless, \"abet\" carry an implication of purposive attitude towards
it.

Similarly, the same principle was declared in *Johnson v. United
States*, 195 F.2d 673 (8th Cir. 1952):

Generally speaking, to find one guilty as a principal on the ground that
he was an aider and abetter, it must be proven that he shared in the
criminal intent of the principal and there must be a community of
unlawful purpose at the time the act is committed. As the term \"aiding
and abetting\" implies, it assumes some participation in the criminal
act in furtherance of the common design, either before or at the time
the criminal act is committed.

It would be a dangerous precedent indeed to hold that mere
communications to the effect that another might or probably would commit
a criminal offense amount to an aiding and abetting of the offense
should it ultimately be committed.

There being no evidence whatever that the defendant ever communicated to
Kent the idea that he would in any way aid him in the sale of any
marijuana, or said anything to Kent to encourage or induce him or direct
him to do so, or counseled Kent in the sale of marijuana, or did
anything more than describe Kent to another person as an individual who
might sell some marijuana, or would derive any benefit, consideration or
reward from such a sale, there was no proof of an aiding and abetting,
and the conviction should, therefore, be reversed as a matter of law.

Remanded with directions to dismiss.

State v. McVay

 

### *State v. McVay*

Supreme Court of Rhode Island

132 A. 436 (R.I. 1926)

 

BARROWS, J.

Heard on a certification of a question of law before trial. Three
indictments for manslaughter, each containing four counts, were brought
against the captain and engineer of the Steamer Mackinac as principals
and against Kelley as accessory before the fact. The steamer carried
several hundred passengers from Pawtucket to Newport via Narragansett
Bay. The boiler producing the steam by which the vessel was propelled,
burst near Newport and many lives were lost. The present indictments are
for causing the deaths of three persons killed by escaping steam after
the explosion of the boiler.

The same question is raised upon each indictment. That question is:

"May a defendant be indicted and convicted of being an accessory before
the fact to the crime of manslaughter arising through criminal
negligence as set forth in the indictment?"

In the first count the negligence charged is the "wanton and willful"
creation of any steam in a boiler known to be worn, corroded, defective
and unsafe, as a result whereof an explosion occurred killing a
passenger; the charge against Kelley as accessory is that "before said
felony and manslaughter was committed," . . . he did at Pawtucket
"feloniously and maliciously aid, assist, abet, counsel, hire, command
and procure the said George W. McVay and John A. Grant, the said felony
and manslaughter in manner and form aforesaid to do and commit."

Because the manslaughter charge is "\[w\]ithout malice and "involuntary"
Kelley contends that he can not be indicted legally as an accessory
before the fact. The argument is that manslaughter being a sudden and
unpremeditated crime inadvertent and unintentional by its very nature
can not be "maliciously" incited before the crime is committed.

While everyone must agree that there can be no accessory before the fact
when a killing results from a sudden and unpremeditated blow, we do not
think it can be broadly stated that premeditation is inconsistent with
every charge of manslaughter. Manslaughter may consist, among other
things, of doing an unlawful act resulting in unintentional killing,
such as violation of motor Vehicle laws or administration of drugs to
procure an abortion. Manslaughter is likewise committed if an
unintentional killing is occasioned by gross negligence in the doing of
an act lawful in itself. There is no inherent reason why, prior to the
commission of such a crime, one may not aid, abet, counsel, command or
procure the doing of the unlawful act or of the lawful act in a
negligent manner. A premeditated act may be involved in such unlawful
homicides.

\[T\]he present indictment for involuntary manslaughter is not
self-contradictory when it charges Kelley to be an accessory before the
fact. It was possible for him at Pawtucket to intentionally direct and
counsel the grossly negligent act which the indictment charges resulted
in the crime. Involuntary manslaughter, as set forth in this indictment
means that defendants exercised no conscious volition to take life but
their negligence was of such a character that criminal intention can be
presumed. The crime was consummated when the explosion occurred. The
volition of the principals was exercised when they chose negligently to
create steam which the boiler could not carry. The doing of the act
charged or failure to perform the duty charged was voluntary and
intentional in the sense that defendants exercised a choice among
courses of conduct. It is obvious that Kelley could participate and is
charged with participating in procuring defendants to act in a grossly
negligent manner prior to the explosion. Legal precedents based upon
facts unlike the present ones do not convince us that he could not have
been an accessory before the fact.

We are convinced that in some types of manslaughter there may be an
accessory before the fact and from our study of the present indictments
we believe they aver such cases. Specific duties are stated to have been
laid upon the captain and engineer. Defendant is charged with full
knowledge of those duties and of the fact that the boiler was unsafe. He
is charged with counseling and procuring the principals at Pawtucket to
disregard their duties and negligently create steam. Until the explosion
no crime was committed. Defendant was not present when the negligence
resulted in a criminal act. The advice at Pawtucket was not continuing
negligence on Kelley's part. The facts set forth in these indictments,
if existent, are such that a jury might find that defendant Kelley, with
full knowledge of the possible danger to human life, recklessly and
willfully advised, counseled and commanded the captain and engineer to
take a chance by negligent action or failure to act.

We therefore answer the question certified on each indictment in the
affirmative. The papers in each case, with this decision certified
thereon, are sent back to the Superior Court for further proceedings.

People v. Russell

 

### *People v. Russell*

Court of Appeals of New York

693 N.E.2d 193 (1998)

 

KAYE, Chief Judge.

Shortly before noon on December 17, 1992, Shamel Burroughs engaged in a
gun battle with Jermaine Russell and Khary Bekka on Centre Mall of the
Red Hook Housing Project in Brooklyn. During the course of the battle,
Patrick Daly, a public school principal looking for a child who had left
school, was fatally wounded by a single stray nine-millimeter bullet
that struck him in the chest. Burroughs, Bekka and Russell-defendants on
this appeal were all charged with second degree murder (Penal Law §
125.25 \[1\], \[2\] ).

Two separate juries, one for Burroughs and another for Russell and
Bekka, were impanelled contemporaneously and heard the evidence
presented at trial. Although ballistics tests were inconclusive in
determining which defendant actually fired the bullet that killed Daly,
the theory of the prosecution was that each of them acted with the
mental culpability required for commission of the crime, and that each
"intentionally aided" the defendant who fired the fatal shot (Penal Law
§ 20.00). Both juries convicted defendants of second degree, depraved
indifference murder (Penal Law § 125.25\[2\] ).

A depraved indifference murder conviction requires proof that defendant,
under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,
recklessly engaged in conduct creating a grave risk of death to another
person, and thereby caused the death of another person (Penal Law §
125.25\[2\] ). Reckless conduct requires awareness and conscious
disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will
occur or that such circumstance exists (Penal Law § 15.05\[3\] ). "The
risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a
reasonable person would observe in the situation" (*Id.*). To constitute
"depraved indifference," conduct must be " 'so wanton, so deficient in a
moral sense of concern, so devoid of regard of the life or lives of
others, and so blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as
that which the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes the
death of another' " Although defendants underscore that only one bullet
killed Patrick Daly and it is uncertain which of them fired that bullet,
the prosecution was not required to prove which defendant fired the
fatal shot when the evidence was sufficient to establish that each
defendant acted with the mental culpability required for the commission
of depraved indifference murder, and each defendant "intentionally
aided" the defendant who fired the fatal shot. Defendants urge, however,
that the evidence adduced at trial did not support a finding that
they-as adversaries in a deadly gun battle-shared the "community of
purpose" necessary for accomplice liability. We disagree. The fact that
defendants set out to injure or kill one another does not rationally
preclude a finding that they intentionally aided each other to engage in
the mutual combat that caused Daly\'s death.

*People v. Abbott*, 84 A.D.2d 11 provides an apt illustration. That case
involved two defendants-Abbott and Moon-who were engaged in a "drag
race" on a residential street when Abbott lost control and smashed into
another automobile, killing the driver and two passengers. Both
defendants were convicted of criminally negligent homicide, but Moon
asserted that he was not responsible for Abbott\'s actions and that his
conviction should be set aside. Rejecting this argument, the court found
that, although Moon did not strike the victim\'s car and was Abbott\'s
adversary in a competitive race, he intentionally participated with
Abbott in an inherently dangerous and unlawful activity and therefore
shared Abbott\'s culpability. Moon\'s "conduct made the race possible"
in the first place, as there would not have been a race had Moon not
"accepted Abbott\'s challenge" In the present case, the jurors were
instructed:

"If you find that the People have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
\[defendants\] took up each other\'s challenge, shared in the venture
and unjustifiably, voluntarily and jointly created a zone of danger,
then each is responsible for his own acts and the acts of the others . .
. \[and\] it makes no difference whether it was a bullet from Mr.
Bekka\'s gun, Mr. Russell\'s gun or Mr. Burrough\'s gun that penetrated
Mr. Daly and caused his death" (emphasis added).

The trial evidence was sufficient to support each jury\'s findings in
accordance with this charge. Although Burroughs was shooting at Russell
and Bekka, and Russell and Bekka were shooting at Burroughs, there was
adequate proof to justify the finding that the three defendants tacitly
agreed to engage in the gun battle that placed the life of any innocent
bystander at grave risk and ultimately killed Daly. Indeed, unlike an
unanticipated ambush or spontaneous attack that might have taken
defendants by surprise, the gunfight in this case only began after
defendants acknowledged and accepted each others\' challenge to engage
in a deadly battle on a public concourse.

As defendants approached one another on Centre Mall, a grassy open area
that serves as a thoroughfare for the 7,000 residents of the 28-building
housing complex, it was evident that an encounter between them would be
violent and would endanger others. There was trial evidence that when
Burroughs first saw Bekka and Russell walking toward him, he immediately
recognized the danger, instructing the two female friends accompanying
him, one of them pregnant, to "run" or "go." They too plainly sensed the
danger because, without hesitation, they turned and ran.

Despite the palpable threat, Burroughs, armed with a nine-millimeter
Glock, did not flee with his friends. Rather, he continued toward
Russell and Bekka, tacitly accepting their invitation and issuing one of
his own. In turn, Russell and Bekka, also armed with automatic weapons,
continued walking toward Burroughs, challenging him and accepting his
challenge. As they drew nearer, defendants each began firing their
high-powered guns, capable of shooting bullets at an average rate of
1,100 feet per second, across the pedestrian thoroughfare. The dozen or
more people in the area, as well as those with windows overlooking the
Mall, were put at grave risk as defendants unleashed a hail of bullets.
Witnesses testified that the battle sounded "like a war" and that
anywhere from nine to 20 shots were fired.

Although Centre Mall is surrounded by buildings affording refuge,
defendants chose instead to run through the area aggressively pursuing
one another. Indeed, even after exchanging an initial volley of shots,
they continued to wage their private war, issuing taunts and ducking
back and forth behind buildings and trees, seeking tactical advantage.
As a result of defendants\' deadly gun battle, Patrick Daly was shot in
the chest and killed almost instantly.

The evidence adduced at trial was also sufficient for the jury to
determine that all three defendants acted with the mental culpability
required for depraved indifference murder, and that they intentionally
aided and encouraged each other to create the lethal crossfire that
caused the death of Patrick Daly.

Accordingly, in each case the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed.

California Court of Appeal

187 Cal.App.3d 410 (Cal. 1986)

 

\[Luparello's girlfriend Teri moved out of the house they shared.
Luparello became obsessed and began searching for her, enlisting some of
his associates in the enterprise.\]

\[Luparello\] hoped to elicit information from Mark Martin, a good
friend of Terri\'s husband and best man at Terri and Ed\'s wedding. At
about 8 p.m. on May 13, Luparello, Brad Wilson, Orduna, Salmon and a
person identified as "Spooky" gathered at Luparello\'s house. In talking
to Luparello and Orduna, Salmon stated they were going to "thump" the
person from whom they wanted information. Orduna agreed with Salmon.
Luparello remarked he would like the information at any cost. At this
time, Orduna was carrying a sword and Salmon had nunchakus. Salmon also
loaded a .22 caliber rifle belonging to Luparello. Thereafter Luparello,
Orduna, Salmon and "Spooky" left the house, taking the weapons, though
not the rifle, with them. After 35 minutes the group returned, picked up
Brad Wilson, and drove to Mark Martin\'s house. Orduna, Salmon and Brad
Wilson got out of the car and approached Martin\'s house. Orduna and
Salmon were carrying their respective weapons. Orduna and Salmon
instructed Brad to lure Mark Martin from his house and they would beat
him. Brad, however, refused to do so. When Martin came to the door, Brad
asked only if he knew Terri\'s whereabouts. Orduna and Salmon, who were
waiting in the shadows at the sides of the house, later chided Brad for
not getting Martin to leave his house.

On the next evening, May 14, 1981, Brad Wilson returned home to find
Orduna and Salmon inside. They were again armed with a sword and
nunchakus, respectively. Luparello was present, but was making a
telephone call at the time. After 15 or 20 minutes, Orduna and Salmon
left. Approximately two hours later, Orduna knocked on the door of Mark
Martin\'s house. When Martin, who owned an automotive machine shop, came
to the door, Orduna asked whether he would look at Orduna\'s car which
was parked in the street. After Martin stepped out of his house, Orduna
quickly backed away. Someone in or near the parked car, the engine of
which was running, fired six shots at Martin and he fell to the porch
and died. Orduna ran to the car, and he and his companion drove off.

\[Luparello was convicted of Martin's murder under both co-conspirator
and accomplice liability theories and appealed both.\]

Luparello first faults both theories for "imposing" the mens rea of the
perpetrator upon him. As Luparello views it, both theories work to
presume conclusively the accomplice shares the perpetrator\'s intent.
Luparello errs, \[however\] when he concludes the perpetrator and
accomplice must "share" an identical intent to be found criminally
responsible for the same crime. Technically, only the perpetrator can
(and must) manifest the mens rea of the crime committed. Accomplice
liability is premised on a different or, more appropriately, an
equivalent mens rea. Thus, to be a principal to a crime, the aider and
abettor must intend to commit the offense or to encourage or facilitate
its commission. Liability is extended to reach the actual, rather than
the planned or "intended" crime, committed on the policy \[that\] aiders
and abettors should be responsible for the criminal harms they have
naturally, probably and foreseeably put in motion.

The California Supreme Court \[held\] in the recent case of *People v.
Croy*, supra., 41 Cal.3d 1:

The requirement that the jury determine the intent with which a person
tried as an aider and abettor has acted is not designed to ensure that
his conduct constitutes the offense with which he is charged. His
liability is vicarious. Like the conspirator whose liability is
predicated on acts other than and short of those constituting the
elements of the charged offense, if the acts are undertaken with the
intent that the actual perpetrator\'s purpose be facilitated thereby, he
is a principal and liable for the commission of the offense. Also like a
conspirator, he is guilty not only of the offense he intended to
facilitate or encourage, but also of any reasonably foreseeable offense
committed by the person he aids and abets. . . 

It follows that a defendant whose liability is predicated on his status
as an aider and abettor need not have intended to encourage or
facilitate the particular offense ultimately committed by the
perpetrator. His knowledge that an act which is criminal was intended,
and his action taken with the intent that the act be encouraged or
facilitated, are sufficient to impose liability on him for any
reasonably foreseeable offense committed as a consequence by the
perpetrator. It is the intent to encourage and bring about conduct that
is criminal, not the specific intent that is an element of the target
offense, which ... must be found by the jury \...."

\[Following *Croy*, the court concluded that Luparello could be
convicted for the death of Martin on an aiding and abetting theory.\]

Wiener, J., concurring

The major fallacy I see in the "foreseeable consequence" doctrine is not
so much that it attributes an unintended act to the
accomplice/coconspirator but rather that it assesses the degree of his
culpability for that act not by his own mental state but rather by the
mental state of the perpetrator and/or the circumstances of the crime.
The present case provides an appropriate example. The assault on Mark
Martin contemplated by the conspiracy involved a foreseeable risk of
death or serious injury. We can assume (although there was no jury
finding on the issue) that Luparello was criminally negligent in failing
to appreciate the degree of risk. Under usual circumstances, a person
negligently causing the death of another is guilty, at most, of
involuntary manslaughter. Here, however, Luparello\'s liability is not
based on his individual mental state but instead turns on the jury\'s
finding that the unidentified shooter intentionally killed Martin while
lying in wait. Thus, Luparello is guilty of first degree murder. If the
circumstances of Luparello\'s participation were exactly the same but
the shooter did not "lie in wait," Luparello could only be convicted of
second degree murder. I am intrigued by the notion that if unknown to
Luparello, the shooter ingested drugs and/or alcohol to the point where
he did not in fact harbor the requisite malice, Luparello would
presumably be guilty only of voluntary manslaughter. And to take it a
step further, if it turned out the shooter was insane, would Luparello
have no liability at all for Martin\'s homicide.

The drafters of the Model Penal Code reached a similar conclusion.
Section 2.06(3)(a) establishes a standard for accomplice liability
which... requires that the accomplice act "with the purpose of promoting
or facilitating the commission of the offense . . . " Missing from the
Model Penal Code, however, is any reference to the "foreseeable
consequence" doctrine. The Comment to the section addresses the issue as
follows:

"\[The accomplice\] must have the purpose to promote or facilitate the
particular conduct that forms the basis for the charge, and thus he will
not be liable for conduct that does not fall within this purpose.

This does not mean, of course, that the precise means used in the
commission of the crime must have been fixed or contemplated or, when
they have been, that liability is limited to their employment. One who
solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is an
accomplice in whatever means may be employed, insofar as they constitute
or commit an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the
association. But when a wholly different crime has been committed, thus
involving conduct not within the conscious objectives of the accomplice,
he is not liable for it"

In our means-oriented society, to have the end alone justify the
punishment is unconscionable. The artificial imputation of stepped-up
intent, inherent in both the felony-murder rule and the "foreseeable
consequence" doctrine, is inconsistent with the "universal and
persistent" notion that criminal punishment must be proportional to the
defendant\'s culpable mental state. (See *Morissette v. United States*
(1952) 342 U.S. 246. Justice Mosk\'s dissent in *Taylor v. Superior
Court* (1970) 3 Cal.3d 578, 593 expressed it well: "Fundamental
principles of criminal responsibility dictate that the defendant be
subject to a greater penalty only when he has demonstrated a greater
degree of culpability. To ignore that rule is at best to frustrate the
deterrent purpose of punishment, and at worst to risk constitutional
invalidation on the ground of invidious discrimination." The fact that
the accomplice or coconspirator intended to facilitate some less serious
criminal act does not render these fundamental principles inapplicable.
As the United States Supreme Court has explained, "The constitutional
necessity of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not confined to those
defendants who are morally blameless. Under our system of criminal
justice even a thief is entitled to complain that he has been
unconstitutionally convicted and imprisoned as a burglar." (*Jackson v.
Virginia* (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 323-324.)

 

 

 

6.2

Conspiracy

 

Conspiracy, unlike complicity, is a standalone crime. Its requirements
are very minimal: at common law, only an agreement to commit unlawful
actions. The agreement, itself, is the actus reus. Under federal law, an
act in furtherance is needed to seal the conspiracy. Often, proving
conspiracy is much easier than proving a completed or even an attempted
crime, and so conspiracy has become a favorite tool of prosecutors to
lower the burden of proof, accumulate charges, or increase the number of
people implicated in a crime.

In addition, conspiracy is, like complicity, a theory by which one
defendant is made liable for the conduct of another.

As you read these cases, consider the distinctions between conspiracy
and complicity. Consider also how far liability extends. What is the
mens rea for the crime of conspiracy itself? What mens rea is necessary
for the subsequent crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy?
How do the various formulations of conspiracy liability interact with
the justifications of punishment---retribution, deterrence,
incapacitation, and rehabilitation?

### Section 5.03. Criminal Conspiracy.

\(1\) Definition of Conspiracy. A person is guilty of conspiracy with
another person or persons to commit a crime if with the purpose of
promoting or facilitating its commission he:

\(a\) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more
of them will engage in conduct that constitutes such crime or an attempt
or solicitation to commit such crime; or

\(b\) agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or
commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such
crime.

\(2\) Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship. If a person guilty of
conspiracy, as defined by Subsection (1) of this Section, knows that a
person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with
another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of
conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows
their identity, to commit such crime.

\(3\) Conspiracy with Multiple Criminal Objectives. If a person
conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one
conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same
agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.

\(4\) Joinder and Venue in Conspiracy Prosecutions.

\[omitted\]

\(5\) Overt Act. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a
crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree, unless an
overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have
been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.

\(6\) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. It is an affirmative defense
that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success
of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

\(7\) Duration of Conspiracy.

Colorado Conspiracy Statute

 

### Colorado Revised Statutes § 18-2-201

\(1\) A person commits conspiracy to commit a crime if, with the intent
to promote or facilitate its commission, he agrees with another person
or persons that they, or one or more of them, will engage in conduct
which constitutes a crime or an attempt to commit a crime, or he agrees
to aid the other person or persons in the planning or commission of a
crime or of an attempt to commit such crime.

an overt act in pursuance of that conspiracy is proved to have been done
by him or by a person with whom he conspired.

\(3\) If a person knows that one with whom he conspires to commit a
crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same
crime, he is guilty of conspiring to commit a crime with the other
person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity.

\(4\) If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty
of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are part of a
single criminal episode.

(4.5) Conspiracy to commit any crime for which a court is required to
sentence a defendant for a crime of violence in accordance with section
18-1.3-406 is itself a crime of violence for the purposes of that
section.

\(5\) If a person conspires to commit a felony which is defined by any
statute other than one contained in this title and for which conspiracy
no penalty is specifically provided, he is guilty of a class 6 felony.

statute other than one contained in this title and for which conspiracy
no penalty is specifically provided, he is guilty of a class 3
misdemeanor.

 

 

 

6.2.3

Actus Reus and Mens Rea

 

As the statutes above make clear, the essence of a conspiracy is an
agreement to commit criminal acts. That much is relatively clear.
Exactly what evidence will suffice to demonstrate an agreement, however,
remains controversial. The first case examines when a conspiracy can be
inferred from the fact that two or more partiers are acting in unison.
In the second case, it is clear that there is an agreement between two
parties and that one of them is engaged in criminal conduct. The
question for the court is whether the defendant has a sufficiently
culpable mental state to be deemed to have agreed to become a part of
the criminal enterprise.

United States v. Garcia

 

### *United States v. Garcia*

United States Court of Appeals

151 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 1998)

 

Reinhardt, J.

In this case, we consider whether testimony regarding the existence of
an implicit, general agreement among gang members to support one another
in fights against rival gangs can constitute sufficient evidence to
support a conviction of conspiracy to commit assault when the conduct of
the alleged conspirators is otherwise insufficient.

One evening, a confrontation broke out between rival gangs at a party on
the Pasqua Yaqui Indian reservation. The resultant gunfire injured four
young people, including appellant Cody Garcia. Two young men involved in
the shooting, Garcia and Noah Humo, were charged with conspiracy to
assault three named individuals with dangerous weapons. A jury acquitted
Humo but convicted Garcia. Because there is no direct evidence of an
agreement to commit the criminal act which was the alleged object of the
conspiracy, and because the circumstances of the shootings do not
support the existence of an agreement, implicit or explicit, the
government relied heavily on the gang affiliation of the participants to
show the existence of such an agreement. We hold that gang membership
itself cannot establish guilt of a crime, and a general agreement,
implicit or explicit, to support one another in gang fights does not
provide substantial proof of the specific agreement required for a
conviction of conspiracy to commit assault. The defendant\'s conviction
therefore rests on insufficient evidence, and we reverse.

**Background**

The party at which the shootings occurred was held in territory
controlled by the Crips gang. The participants were apparently mainly
young Native Americans. While many of the attendees were associated with
the Crips, some members of the Bloods gang were also present. Appellant
Cody Garcia arrived at the party in a truck driven by his uncle, waving
a red bandanna out the truck window and calling out his gang
affiliation: \"ESPB Blood!\" Upon arrival, Garcia began \"talking
smack\" to (insulting) several Crips members. Prosecution witnesses
testified that Garcia\'s actions suggested that he was looking for
trouble and issuing a challenge to fight to the Crips at the party.

Meanwhile, Garcia\'s fellow Bloods member Julio Baltazar was also
\"talking smack\" to Crips members, and Blood Noah Humo bumped shoulders
with one Crips member and called another by a derogatory Spanish term.
Neither Baltazar nor Humo had arrived with Garcia, nor is there any
indication that they had met before the party to discuss plans or that
they were seen talking together during the party.

At some point, shooting broke out. Witnesses saw both Bloods and Crips,
including Garcia and Humo, shooting at one another. Baltazar was seen
waving a knife or trying to stab a Crip. The testimony at trial does not
shed light on what took place immediately prior to the shooting, other
than the fact that one witness heard Garcia ask, \"Who has the gun?\"
There is some indication that members of the two gangs may have
\"squared off\" before the shooting began. No testimony establishes
whether the shooting followed a provocation or verbal or physical
confrontation.

Four individuals were injured by the gunfire: the defendant, Stacy
Romero, Gabriel Valenzuela, and Gilbert Baumea. Stacy Romero who at the
time was twelve years old was the cousin both of Garcia\'s co-defendant
Humo and his fellow Blood, Baltazar. No evidence presented at trial
established that any of the injured persons was shot by Garcia, and he
was charged only with conspiracy. The government charged both Garcia and
Humo with conspiracy to assault Romero, Valenzuela, and Baumea with
dangerous weapons under 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 113(a) (3) and 1153; Humo
alone was charged with two counts of assault resulting in serious bodily
injury under 18 U.S.C. §§ 113(a) (6) and 1153.

After a jury trial, Humo was acquitted on all counts. Garcia was
convicted of conspiracy to assault with a dangerous weapon and sentenced
to 60 months in prison. He appeals on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence to support his conviction.

**Sufficiency of the Evidence**

In order to prove a conspiracy, the government must present sufficient
evidence to demonstrate both an overt act and an agreement to engage in
the specific criminal activity charged in the indictment. While an
implicit agreement may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, proof
that an individual engaged in illegal acts with others is not sufficient
to demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy. Both the existence of and
the individual\'s connection to the conspiracy must be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.

The government claims that it can establish the agreement to assault in
two ways: first, that the concerted provocative and violent acts by
Garcia, Humo and Baltazar are sufficient to show the existence of a
prior agreement; and second, that by agreeing to become a member of the
gang, Garcia implicitly agreed to support his fellow gang members in
violent confrontations.

However, no inference of the existence of any agreement could reasonably
be drawn from the actions of Garcia and other Bloods members on the
night of the shooting. An inference of an agreement is permissible only
when the nature of the acts would logically require coordination and
planning. The government presented no witnesses who could explain the
series of events immediately preceding the shooting, so there is nothing
to suggest that the violence began in accordance with some
prearrangement. The facts establish only that perceived insults
escalated tensions between members of rival gangs and that an ongoing
gang-related dispute erupted into shooting. Testimony presented at trial
suggest more chaos than concert. Such evidence does not establish that
parties to a conspiracy \"work \[ed\] together understandingly, with a
single design for the accomplishment of a common purpose.\" *United
States v. Melchor-Lopez*, 627 F.2d 886, 890 (9th Cir. 1980).

Given that this circumstantial evidence fails to suggest the existence
of an agreement, we are left only with gang membership as proof that
Garcia conspired with fellow Bloods to shoot the three named
individuals. The government points to expert testimony at the trial by a
local gang unit detective, who stated that generally gang members have a
\"basic agreement\" to back one another up in fights, an agreement which
requires no advance planning or coordination. This testimony, which at
most establishes one of the characteristics of gangs but not a specific
objective of a particular gang\--let alone a specific agreement on the
part of its members to accomplish an illegal objective\--is insufficient
to provide proof of a conspiracy to commit assault or other illegal
acts.

Recent authority in this circuit establishes that "\[m\]embership in a
gang cannot serve as proof of intent, or of the facilitation, advice,
aid, promotion, encouragement or instigation needed to establish aiding
and abetting.\" *Mitchell v. Prunty*, 107 F.3d 1337, 1342 (9th Cir.
1997). In overturning the state conviction of a gang member that rested
on the theory that the defendant aided and abetted a murder by \"fanning
the fires of gang warfare,\" the *Mitchell* opinion expressed concern
that allowing a conviction on this basis would \"smack \... of guilt by
association.\" The same concern is implicated when a conspiracy
conviction is based on evidence that an individual is affiliated with a
gang which has a general rivalry with other gangs, and that this rivalry
sometimes escalates into violent confrontations.

The Mitchell court reasoned that the conviction in that case necessarily
rested on the faulty assumption that gang members typically act in a
concerted fashion. Such an assumption would be particularly
inappropriate here. Acts of provocation such as \"talking smack\" or
bumping into rival gang members certainly does not prove a high level of
planning or coordination. Rather, it may be fairly typical behavior in a
situation in which individuals who belong to rival gangs attend the same
events. At most, it indicates that members of a particular gang may be
looking for trouble, or ready to fight. It does not demonstrate a
coordinated effort with a specific illegal objective in mind. The fact
that gang members attend a function armed with weapons may prove that
they are prepared for violence, but without other evidence it does not
establish that they have made plans to initiate it. And the fact that
more than one member of the Bloods was shooting at rival gang members
also does not prove a prearrangement\--the Crips, too, were able to pull
out their guns almost immediately, suggesting that readiness for a
gunfight requires no prior agreement. Such readiness may be a sad
commentary on the state of mind of many of the nation\'s youth, but it
is not indicative of a criminal conspiracy.

Finally, as the *Mitchell* panel warned, allowing gang membership to
serve as evidence of aiding and abetting \"would invite absurd results.
Any gang member could be held liable for any other gang member\'s act at
any time so long as the act was predicated on \'the common purpose of
fighting the enemy.'" Similarly, allowing a general agreement among gang
members to back each other up to serve as sufficient evidence of a
conspiracy would mean that any time more than one gang member was
involved in a fight it would constitute an act in furtherance of the
conspiracy and all gang members could be held criminally
responsible\--whether they participated in or had knowledge of the
particular criminal act, and whether or not they were present when the
act occurred. Indeed, were we to accept \"fighting the enemy\" as an
illegal objective, all gang members would probably be subject to felony
prosecutions sooner rather than later, even though they had never
personally committed an improper act. This is contrary to fundamental
principles of our justice system. \"\[T\]here can be no conviction for
guilt by association.\"

Because of these concerns, evidence of gang membership cannot itself
prove that an individual has entered a criminal agreement to attack
members of rival gangs. Moreover, here the conspiracy allegation was
even more specific: the state charged Garcia with conspiracy to assault
three specific individuals\--Romero, Baumea and Valenzuela\--with deadly
weapons. Even if the testimony presented by the state had sufficed to
establish a general conspiracy to assault Crips, it certainly did not
even hint at a conspiracy to assault the three individuals listed in the
indictment. Of course, a more general indictment would not have solved
the state\'s problems in this case. In some cases, when evidence
establishes that a particular gang has a specific illegal objective such
as selling drugs, evidence of gang membership may help to link gang
members to that objective. However, a general practice of supporting one
another in fights, which is one of the ordinary characteristics of
gangs, does not constitute the type of illegal objective that can form
the predicate for a conspiracy charge.

**Conclusion**

Because the government introduced no evidence from which a jury could
reasonably have found the existence of an agreement to engage in any
unlawful conduct, the evidence of conspiracy was insufficient as a
matter of law. A contrary result would allow courts to assume an ongoing
conspiracy, universal among gangs and gang members, to commit any number
of violent acts, rendering gang members automatically guilty of
conspiracy for any improper conduct by any member. We therefore reverse
Garcia\'s conviction and remand to the district court to order his
immediate release.

People v. Lauria

 

### *People v. Lauria*

California District Court of Appeals

59 Cal. Rptr. 628 (1967)

 

FLEMING, Associate Justice.

In an investigation of call-girl activity the police focused their
attention on three prostitutes actively plying their trade on call, each
of whom was using Lauria\'s telephone answering service, presumably for
business purposes.

On January 8, 1965, Stella Weeks, a policewoman, signed up for telephone
service with Lauria\'s answering service. Mrs. Weeks, in the course of
her conversation with Lauria\'s office manager, hinted broadly that she
was a prostitute concerned with the secrecy of her activities and their
concealment from the police. She was assured that the operation of the
service was discreet and 'about as safe as you can get.' It was arranged
that Mrs. Weeks need not leave her address with the answering service,
but could pick up her calls and pay her bills in person.

On February 11, Mrs. Weeks talked to Lauria on the telephone and told
him her business was modeling and she had been referred to the answering
service by Terry, one of the three prostitutes under investigation. She
complained that because of the operation of the service she had lost two
valuable customers, referred to as tricks. Lauria defended his service
and said that her friends had probably lied to her about having left
calls for her. But he did not respond to Mrs. Weeks\' hints that she
needed customers in order to make money, other than to invite her to his
house for a personal visit in order to get better acquainted. In the
course of his talk he said 'his business was taking messages.'

On February 15, Mrs. Weeks talked on the telephone to Lauria\'s office
manager and again complained of two lost calls, which she described as a
\$50 and a \$100 trick. On investigation the office manager could find
nothing wrong, but she said she would alert the switchboard operators
about slip-ups on calls.

On April 1 Lauria and the three prostitutes were arrested. Lauria
complained to the police that this attention was undeserved, stating
that Hollywood Call Board had 60 to 70 prostitutes on its board while
his own service had only 9 or 10, that he kept separate records for
known or suspected prostitutes for the convenience of himself and the
police. When asked if his records were available to police who might
come to the office to investigate call girls, Lauria replied that they
were whenever the police had a specific name. However, his service
didn\'t 'arbitrarily tell the police about prostitutes on our board. As
long as they pay their bills we tolerate them.' In a subsequent
voluntary appearance before the Grand Jury Lauria testified he had
always cooperated with the police. But he admitted he knew some of his
customers were prostitutes, and he knew Terry was a prostitute because
he had personally used her services, and he knew she was paying for 500
calls a month.

Lauria and the three prostitutes were indicted for conspiracy to commit
prostitution, and nine overt acts were specified. Subsequently, the
trial court set aside the indictment as having been brought without
reasonable or probable cause. The People have appealed, claiming that a
sufficient showing of an unlawful agreement to further prostitution was
made.

To establish agreement, the People need show no more than a tacit,
mutual understanding between coconspirators to accomplish an unlawful
act. Here the People attempted to establish a conspiracy by showing that
Lauria, well aware that his codefendants were prostitutes who received
business calls from customers through his telephone answering service,
continued to furnish them with such service. This approach attempts to
equate knowledge of another\'s criminal activity with conspiracy to
further such criminal activity, and poses the question of the criminal
responsibility of a furnisher of goods or services who knows his product
is being used to assist the operation of an illegal business. Under what
circumstances does a supplier become a part of a conspiracy to further
an illegal enterprise by furnishing goods or services which he knows are
to be used by the buyer for criminal purposes?

The two leading cases on this point face in opposite directions. In
*United States v. Falcone*, 311 U.S. 205 (1940), the sellers of large
quantities of sugar, yeast, and cans were absolved from participation in
a moonshining conspiracy among distillers who bought from them, while in
*Direct Sales Co. v. United States*, 319 U.S. 703 (1943), a wholesaler
of drugs was convicted of conspiracy to violate the federal narcotic
laws by selling drugs in quantity to a codefendant physician who was
supplying them to addicts. The distinction between these two cases
appears primarily based on the proposition that distributors of such
dangerous products as drugs are required to exercise greater
discrimination in the conduct of their business than are distributors of
innocuous substances like sugar and yeast.

In the earlier case, *Falcone*, the sellers\' knowledge of the illegal
use of the goods was insufficient by itself to make the sellers
participants in a conspiracy with the distillers who bought from them.
Such knowledge fell short of proof of a conspiracy, and evidence on the
volume of sales was too vague to support a jury finding that respondents
knew of the conspiracy from the size of the sales alone.

In the later case of *Direct Sales*, the conviction of a drug wholesaler
for conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws was affirmed on a
showing that it had actively promoted the sale of morphine sulphate in
quantity and had sold codefendant physician, who practiced in a small
town in South Carolina, more than 300 times his normal requirements of
the drug, even though it had been repeatedly warned of the dangers of
unrestricted sales of the drug. The court contrasted the restricted
goods involved in *Direct Sales* with the articles of free commerce
involved in *Falcone*: \"All articles of commerce may be put to illegal
ends,\" said the court. \"But all do not have inherently the same
susceptibility to harmful and illegal use. . . This difference is
important for two purposes. One is for making certain that the seller
knows the buyer\'s intended illegal use. The other is to show that by
the sale he intends to further, promote and cooperate in it. This
intent, when given effect by overt act, is the gist of conspiracy. While
it is not identical with mere knowledge that another purposes unlawful
action, it is not unrelated to such knowledge. . . The step from
knowledge to intent and agreement may be taken. There is more than
suspicion, more than knowledge, acquiescence, carelessness,
indifference, lack of concern. There is informed and interested
cooperation, stimulation, instigation. And there is also a 'stake in the
venture' which, even if it may not be essential, is not irrelevant to
the question of conspiracy.\'\"

While *Falcone* and *Direct Sales* may not be entirely consistent with
each other in their full implications, they do provide us with a
framework for the criminal liability of a supplier of lawful goods or
services put to unlawful use. Both the element of knowledge of the
illegal use of the goods or services and the element of intent to
further that use must be present in order to make the supplier a
participant in a criminal conspiracy.

Proof of knowledge is ordinarily a question of fact and requires no
extended discussion in the present case. The knowledge of the supplier
was sufficiently established when Lauria admitted he knew some of his
customers were prostitutes and admitted he knew that Terry, an active
subscriber to his service, was a prostitute. In the face of these
admissions he could scarcely claim to have relied on the normal
assumption an operator of a business or service is entitled to make,
that his customers are behaving themselves in the eyes of the law.
Because Lauria knew in fact that some of his customers were prostitutes,
it is a legitimate inference he knew they were subscribing to his
answering service for illegal business purposes and were using his
service to make assignations for prostitution. On this record we think
the prosecution is entitled to claim positive knowledge by Lauria of the
use of his service to facilitate the business of position.

The more perplexing issue in the case is the sufficiency of proof of
intent to further the criminal enterprise. The element of intent may be
proved either by direct evidence, or by evidence of circumstances from
which an intent to further a criminal enterprise by supplying lawful
goods or services may be inferred. Direct evidence of participation,
such as advice from the supplier of legal goods or services to the user
of those goods or services on their use for illegal purposes, provides
the simplest case. When the intent to further and promote the criminal
enterprise comes from the lips of the supplier himself, ambiguities of
inference from circumstance need not trouble us. But in cases where
direct proof of complicity is lacking, intent to further the conspiracy
must be derived from the sale itself and its surrounding circumstances
in order to establish the supplier\'s express or tacit agreement to join
the conspiracy.

In the case at bench the prosecution argues that since Lauria knew his
customers were using his service for illegal purposes but nevertheless
continued to furnish it to them, he must have intended to assist them in
carrying out their illegal activities. Thus through a union of knowledge
and intent he became a participant in a criminal conspiracy.
Essentially, the People argue that knowledge alone of the continuing use
of his telephone facilities for criminal purposes provided a sufficient
basis from which his intent to participate in those criminal activities
could be inferred.

In examining precedents in this field we find that sometimes, but not
always, the criminal intent of the supplier may be inferred from his
knowledge of the unlawful use made of the product he supplies. Some
consideration of characteristic patterns may be helpful.

Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the purveyor of legal goods
for illegal use has acquired a stake in the venture. (*United States v.
Falcone*, 2 Cir. 109 F.2d 579, 581.) For example, in *Regina v. Thomas*,
(1957), 2 All.E.R. 181, 342, a prosecution for living off the earnings
of prostitution, the evidence showed that the accused, knowing the woman
to be a convicted prostitute, agreed to let her have the use of his room
between the hours of 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. for a charge of \$3 a night. The
Court of Criminal Appeal refused an appeal from the conviction, holding
that when the accused rented a room at a grossly inflated rent to a
prostitute for the purpose of carrying on her trade, a jury could find
he was living on the earnings of prostitution.

In the present case, no proof was offered of inflated charges for the
telephone answering services furnished the codefendants.

Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when no legitimate use for the
goods or services exists. The leading California case is *People v.
McLaughlin*, 111 Cal.App.2d 781, 245 P.2d 1076, in which the court
upheld a conviction of the suppliers of horse-racing information by wire
for conspiracy to promote bookmaking, when it had been established that
wireservice information had no other use than to supply information
needed by bookmakers to conduct illegal gambling operations.

In *Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions*, (1962) A.C. 220, the
defendant was convicted of conspiracy to corrupt public morals and of
living on the earnings of prostitution, when he published a directory
consisting almost entirely of advertisements of the names, addresses,
and specialized talents of prostitutes. Publication of such a directory,
said the court, could have no legitimate use and serve no other purpose
than to advertise the professional services of the prostitutes whose
advertisements appeared in the directory. The publisher could be deemed
a participant in the profits from the business activities of his
principal advertisers.

Other services of a comparable nature come to mind: the manufacturer of
crooked dice and marked cards who sells his product to gambling casinos;
the tipster who furnishes information on the movement of law enforcement
officers to known lawbreakers. In such cases the supplier must
necessarily have an intent to further the illegal enterprise since there
is no known honest use for his goods.

However, there is nothing in the furnishing of telephone answering
service which would necessarily imply assistance in the performance of
illegal activities. Nor is any inference to be derived from the use of
an answering service by women, either in any particular volume of calls,
or outside normal working hours. Night-club entertainers, registered
nurses, faith healers, public stenographers, photographic models, and
freelance substitute employees, provide examples of women in legitimate
occupations whose employment might cause them to receive a volume of
telephone calls at irregular hours.

Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the volume of business with
the buyer is grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand, or when
sales for illegal use amount to a high proportion of the seller\'s total
business. In such cases an intent to participate in the illegal
enterprise may be inferred from the quantity of the business done. For
example, in *Direct Sales*, supra, the sale of narcotics to a rural
physician in quantities 300 times greater than he would have normal use
for provided potent evidence of an intent to further the illegal
activity. In the same case the court also found significant the fact
that the wholesaler had attracted as customers a disproportionately
large group of physicians who had been convicted of violating the
Harrison Act. In *Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions*, (1962) A.C.
220, almost the entire business of the directory came from prostitutes.

No evidence of any unusual volume of business with prostitutes was
presented by the prosecution against Lauria.

Inflated charges, the sale of goods with no legitimate use, sales in
inflated amounts, each may provide a fact of sufficient moment from
which the intent of the seller to participate in the criminal enterprise
may be inferred. In such instances participation by the supplier of
legal goods to the illegal enterprise may be inferred because in one way
or another the supplier has acquired a special interest in the operation
of the illegal enterprise. His intent to participate in the crime of
which he has knowledge may be inferred from the existence of his special
interest.

Yet there are cases in which it cannot reasonably be said that the
supplier has a stake in the venture or has acquired a special interest
in the enterprise, but in which he has been held liable as a participant
on the basis of knowledge alone. Some suggestion of this appears in
*Direct Sales*, supra, where both the knowledge of the illegal use of
the drugs and the intent of the supplier to aid that use were inferred.
In *Regina v. Bainbridge* (1959), 3 W.L.R. 656 (CCA 6), a supplier of
oxygen-cutting equipment to one known to intend to use it to break into
a bank was convicted as an accessory to the crime. It seems apparent
from these cases that a supplier who furnishes equipment which he knows
will be used to commit a serious crime may be deemed from that knowledge
alone to have intended to produce the result. Such proof may justify an
inference that the furnisher intended to aid the execution of the crime
and that he thereby became a participant. For instance, we think the
operator of a telephone answering service with positive knowledge that
this service was being used to facilitate the extortion of ransom, the
distribution of heroin, or the passing of counterfeit money who
continued to furnish the service with knowledge of its use, might be
chargeable on knowledge alone with participation in a scheme to extort
money, to distribute narcotics, or to pass counterfeit money. The same
result would follow the seller of gasoline who knew the buyer was using
his product to make Molotov cocktails for terroristic use.

Logically, the same reasoning could be extended to crimes of every
description. Yet we do not believe an inference of intent drawn from
knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes
classified as misdemeanors. The duty to take positive action to
dissociate oneself from activities helpful to violations of the criminal
law as far stronger and more compelling for felonies than it is for
misdemeanors or petty offenses. In this respect, as in others, the
distinction between felonies and misdemeanors, between more serious and
less serious crime, retains continuing vitality. In historically the
most serious felony, treason, an individual with knowledge of the
treason can be prosecuted for concealing and failing to disclose it. In
other felonies, both at common law and under the criminal laws of the
United States, an individual knowing of the commission of a felony is
criminally liable for concealing it and failing to make it known to
proper authority. But this crime, known as misprision of felony, has
always been limited to knowledge and concealment of felony and has never
extended to misdemeanor.

With respect to misdemeanors, we conclude that positive knowledge of the
supplier that his products or services are being used for criminal
purposes does not, without more, establish an intent of the supplier to
participate in the misdemeanors. With respect to felonies, we do not
decide the converse, viz. that in all cases of felony knowledge of
criminal use alone may justify an inference of supplier\'s intent to
participate in the crime.

From this analysis of precedent we deduce the following rule: the intent
of a supplier who knows of the criminal use to which his supplies are
put to participate in the criminal activity connected with the use of
his supplies may be established by (1) direct evidence that he intends
to participate, or (2) through an inference that he intends to
participate based on, (a) his special interest in the activity, or (b)
the aggravated nature of the crime itself.

When we review Lauria\'s activities in the light of this analysis, we
find no proof that Lauria took any direct action to further, encourage,
or direct the call-girl activities of his codefendants and we find an
absence of circumstances from which his special interest in their
activities could be inferred. Neither excessive charges for standardized
services, nor the furnishing of services without a legitimate use, nor
an unusual quantity of business with call girls, are present. The
offense which he is charged with furthering is a misdemeanor, a category
of crime which has never been made a required subject of positive
disclosure to public authority. Under these circumstances, although
proof of Lauria\'s knowledge of the criminal activities of his patrons
was sufficient to charge him with that fact, there was insufficient
evidence that he intended to further their criminal activities, and
hence insufficient proof of his participation in a criminal conspiracy
with his codefendants to further prostitution. Since the conspiracy
centered around the activities of Lauria\'s telephone answering service,
the charges against his codefendants likewise fail for want of proof.

In absolving Lauria of complicity in a criminal conspiracy we do not
wish to imply that the public authorities are without remedies to combat
modern manifestations of the world\'s oldest profession. Licensing of
telephone answering services under the police power, together with the
revocation of licenses for the toleration of prostitution, is a possible
civil remedy. The furnishing of telephone answering service in aid of
prostitution could be made a crime. Other solutions will doubtless occur
to vigilant public authorities if the problem of call-girl activity
needs further suppression.

The order is affirmed.

United States v. Pinkerton

 

### *Pinkerton v. United States*

United States Supreme Court

328 U.S. 640 (1946)

 

Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Walter and Daniel Pinkerton are brothers who live a short distance from
each other on Daniel\'s farm. They were indicted for violations of the
Internal Revenue Code. The indictment contained ten substantive counts
and one conspiracy count. The jury found Walter guilty on nine of the
substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. It found Daniel guilty
on six of the substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. Walter was
fined \$500 and sentenced generally on the substantive counts to
imprisonment for thirty months. On the conspiracy count he was given a
two year sentence to run concurrently with the other sentence. Daniel
was fined \$1,000 and sentenced generally on the substantive counts to
imprisonment for thirty months. On the conspiracy count he was fined
\$500 and given a two year sentence to run concurrently with the other
sentence. A single conspiracy was charged and proved. Some of the overt
acts charged in the conspiracy count were the same acts charged in the
substantive counts. Each of the substantive offenses found was committed
pursuant to the conspiracy. Petitioners therefore contend that the
substantive counts became merged in the conspiracy count, and that only
a single sentence not exceeding the maximum two-year penalty provided by
the conspiracy statute (could be imposed. Or to state the matter
differently, they contend that each of the substantive counts became a
separate conspiracy count but since only a single conpsiracy was charged
and proved, only a single sentence for conspiracy could be imposed. They
rely on *Braverman v. United States*, 317 U.S. 49.

In the *Braverman* case the indictment charged no substantive offense.
Each of the several counts charged a conspiracy to violate a different
statute. But only one conspiracy was proved. We held that a single
conspiracy, charged under the general conspiracy statute, however
diverse its objects may be, violates but a single statute and no penalty
greater than the maximum provided for one conspiracy may be imposed.
That case is not apposite here. For the offenses charged and proved were
not only a conspiracy but substantive offenses as well.

Nor can we accept the proposition that the substantive offenses were
merged in the conspiracy. There are, of course, instances where a
conspiracy charge may not be added to the substantive charge. One is
where the agreement of two persons is necessary for the completion of
the substantive crime and there is no ingredient in the conspiracy which
is not present in the completed crime. Another is where the definition
of the substantive offense excludes from punishment for conspiracy one
who voluntarily participates in another\'s crime. But those exceptions
are of a limited character. The common law rule that the substantive
offense, if a felony, was merged in the conspiracy, has little vitality
in this country. It has been long and consistently recognized by the
Court that the commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to
commit it are separate and distinct offenses. The power of Congress to
separate the two and to affix to each a different penalty is well
established. A conviction for the conspiracy may be had though the
substantive offense was completed.

It is contended that there was insufficient evidence to implicate Daniel
in the conspiracy. But we think there was enough evidence for submission
of the issue to the jury.

There is, however, no evidence to show that Daniel participated directly
in the commission of the substantive offenses on which his conviction
has been sustained, although there was evidence to show that these
substantive offenses were in fact committed by Walter in furtherance of
the unlawful agreement or conspiracy existing between the brothers. The
question was submitted to the jury on the theory that each petitioner
could be found guilty of the substantive offenses, if it was found at
the time those offenses were committed petitioners were parties to an
unlawful conspiracy and the substantive offenses charged were in fact
committed in furtherance of it.

Daniel relies on *United States v. Sall*. That case held that
participation in the conspiracy was not itself enough to sustain a
conviction for the substantive offense even though it was committed in
furtherance of the conspiracy. The court held that, in addition to
evidence that the offense was in fact committed in furtherance of the
conspiracy, evidence of direct participation in the commission of the
substantive offense or other evidence from which participation might
fairly be inferred was necessary.

We take a different view. We have here a continuous conspiracy. There is
here no evidence of the affirmative action on the part of Daniel which
is necessary to establish his withdrawal from it. *Hyde v. United
States*, 225 U.S. 347, 369. As stated in that case, 'having joined in an
unlawful scheme, having constituted agents for its performance, scheme
and agency to be continuous until full fruition be secured, until he
does some act to disavow or defeat the purpose he is in no situation to
claim the delay of the law. As the offense has not been terminated or
accomplished, he is still offending. And we think, consciously
offending,---offending as certainly, as we have said, as at the first
moment of his confederation, and consciously through every moment of its
existence.' And so long as the partnership in crime continues, the
partners act for each other in carrying it forward. It is settled that
'an overt act of one partner may be the act of all without any new
agreement specifically directed to that act.' Motive or intent may be
proved by the acts or declarations of some of the conspirators in
furtherance of the common objective. A scheme to use the mails to
defraud, which is joined in by more than one person, is a conspiracy.
Yet all members are responsible, though only one did the mailing. The
governing principle is the same when the substantive offense is
committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the unlawful
project. *Johnson v. United States*, 9 Cir., 62 F.2d 32, 34. The
criminal intent to do the act is established by the formation of the
conspiracy. Each conspirator instigated the commission of the crime. The
unlawful agreement contemplated precisely what was done. It was formed
for the purpose. The act done was in execution of the enterprise. The
rule which holds responsible one who counsels, procures, or commands
another to commit a crime is founded on the same principle. That
principle is recognized in the law of conspiracy when the overt act of
one partner in crime is attributable to all. An overt act is an
essential ingredient of the crime of conspiracy under § 37 of the
Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. § 88, 18 U.S.C.A. § 88. If that can be supplied
by the act of one conspirator, we fail to see why the same or other acts
in furtherance of the conspiracy are likewise not attributable to the
others for the purpose of holding them responsible for the substantive
offense.

A different case would arise if the substantive offense committed by one
of the conspirators was not in fact done in furtherance of the
conspiracy, did not fall within the scope of the unlawful project, or
was merely a part of the ramifications of the plan which could not be
reasonably foreseen as a necessary or natural consequence of the
unlawful agreement. But as we read this record, that is not this case.

Affirmed.

Mr. Justice Rutledge, dissenting in part

Daniel and Walter, who were brothers living near each other, were
charged in several counts with substantive offenses, and then a
conspiracy count was added naming those offenses as overt acts. The
proof showed that Walter alone committed the substantive crimes. There
was none to establish that Daniel participated in them, aided and
abetted Walter in committing them, or knew that he had done so. Daniel
in fact was in the penitentiary, under sentence for other crimes, when
some of Walter\'s crimes were done.

There was evidence, however, to show that over several years Daniel and
Walter had confederated to commit similar crimes concerned with unlawful
possession, transportation, and dealing in whiskey, in fraud of the
federal revenues. On this evidence both were convicted of conspiracy.
Walter also was convicted on the substantive counts on the proof of his
committing the crimes charged. Then, on that evidence without more than
the proof of Daniel\'s criminal agreement with Walter and the latter\'s
overt acts, which were also the substantive offenses charged, the court
told the jury they could find Daniel guilty of those substantive
offenses. They did so.

I think this ruling violates both the letter and the spirit of what
Congress did when it separately defined the three classes of crime,
namely, (1) completed substantive offenses; (2) aiding, abetting or
counseling another to commit them; and (3) conspiracy to commit them.
Not only does this ignore the distinctions Congress has prescribed shall
be observed. It either convicts one man for another\'s crime or punishes
the man convicted twice for the same offense.

The three types of offense are not identical. Nor are their differences
merely verbal. The gist of conspiracy is the agreement; that of aiding,
abetting or counseling is in consciously advising or assisting another
to commit particular offenses, and thus becoming a party to them; that
of substantive crime, going a step beyond mere aiding, abetting,
counseling to completion of the offense.

These general differences are well understood. But when conspiracy has
ripened into completed crime, or has advanced to the stage of aiding and
abetting, it becomes easy to disregard their differences and loosely to
treat one as identical with the other, that is, for every purpose except
the most vital one of imposing sentence. And thus the substance, if not
the technical effect, of double jeopardy or multiple punishment may be
accomplished. Thus also may one be convicted of an offense not charged
or proved against him, on evidence showing he committed another.

Daniel has been held guilty of the substantive crimes committed only by
Walter on proof that he did no more than conspire with him to commit
offenses of the same general character. There was no evidence that he
counseled, advised or had knowledge of those particular acts or
offenses. There was, therefore, none that he aided, abetted or took part
in them. There was only evidence sufficient to show that he had agreed
with Walter at some past time to engage in such transactions generally.
As to Daniel this was only evidence of conspiracy, not of substantive
crime.

The court\'s theory seems to be that Daniel and Walter became general
partners in crime by virtue of their agreement and because of that
agreement without more on his part Daniel became criminally responsible
as a principal for everything Walter did thereafter in the nature of a
criminal offense of the general sort the agreement contemplated, so long
as there was not clear evidence that Daniel had withdrawn from or
revoked the agreement. Whether or not his commitment to the penitentiary
had that effect, the result is a vicarious criminal responsibility as
broad as, or broader than, the vicarious civil liability of a partner
for acts done by a co-partner in the course of the firm\'s business.

Such analogies from private commercial law and the law of torts are
dangerous, in my judgment, for transfer to the criminal field. Guilt
there with us remains personal, not vicarious, for the more serious
offenses. It should be kept so. The effect of Daniel\'s conviction in
this case, to repeat, is either to attribute to him Walter\'s guilt or
to punish him twice for the same offense, namely, agreeing with Walter
to engage in crime. Without the agreement Daniel was guilty of no crime
on this record. With it and no more, so far as his own conduct is
concerned, he was guilty of two.

 

 

 

6.2.4.2

United States v. Alvarez

 

### *United States v. Alvarez*

United States Court of Appeals

755 F.2d 830 (11^th^ Cir. 1985)

 

Appellants Portal, Concepcion, and Hernandez contend that their murder
convictions under Count III were based on an unprecedented and improper
extension of *Pinkerton v. United States*, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). Under
Pinkerton, each member of a conspiracy is criminally liable for any
crime committed by a coconspirator during the course and in furtherance
of the conspiracy, unless the crime "did not fall within the scope of
the unlawful project, or was merely a part of the ramifications of the
plan which could not be reasonably foreseen as a necessary or natural
consequence of the unlawful agreement." The three appellants argue that
murder is not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of a drug conspiracy,
and that their murder convictions therefore should be reversed. We
conclude that, although the murder convictions of the three appellants
may represent an unprecedented application of *Pinkerton*, such an
application is not improper.

**1. Standard of Review**

We note initially that the scope of our review is limited. The
application of the Pinkerton doctrine to a particular set of facts
ultimately is for the jury to decide. In the instant case, the district
court submitted the murder count to the jury with a proper Pinkerton
instruction, and the jury found the three appellants guilty of murder.
We must determine whether the court erred in deciding to submit the
Pinkerton issue to the jury. Our standard of review is whether the
evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to have concluded, beyond
a reasonable doubt, that the murder was a reasonably foreseeable
consequence of the drug conspiracy alleged in the indictment. In making
this assessment, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable
to the government,  and accept all reasonable inferences and credibility
choices made by the jury.

**2. Reasonable Foreseeability**

Upon reviewing the record, we find ample evidence to support the jury\'s
conclusion that the murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of
the drug conspiracy alleged in the indictment. In making this
determination, we rely on two critical factors. First, the evidence
clearly established that the drug conspiracy was designed to effectuate
the sale of a large quantity of cocaine. The conspirators agreed to sell
Agents Rios and D\'Atri three kilograms of cocaine for a total price of
\$147,000. The transaction that led to the murder involved the sale of
one kilogram of cocaine for \$49,000. In short, the drug conspiracy was
no nickel-and-dime operation; under any standards, the amount of drugs
and money involved was quite substantial.

Second, based on the amount of drugs and money involved, the jury was
entitled to infer that, at the time the cocaine sale was arranged, the
conspirators must have been aware of the likelihood (1) that at least
some of their number would be carrying weapons, and (2) that deadly
force would be used, if necessary, to protect the conspirators\'
interests. We have previously acknowledged the "nexus" between weapons
and drugsand we have also recognized that weapons have become "tools of
the trade" for those involved in the distribution of illicit drugs. As
the former Fifth Circuit has stated, "Experience on the trial and
appellate benches has taught that substantial dealers in narcotics keep
firearms on their premises as tools of the trade almost to the same
extent as they keep scales, glassine bags, cutting equipment, and other
narcotic equipment." In light of these observations, and in view of the
amount of drugs and money involved in the instant case, the jury\'s
inference was both reasonable and proper.

In our opinion, these two critical factors provided ample support for
the jury\'s conclusion that the murder was a reasonably foreseeable
consequence of the drug conspiracy alleged in the indictment. In
addition, we note the evidence at trial indicating that at least two of
the conspirators were extremely nervous about the possibility of a
rip-off or a drug bust. During a lull in the negotiations, Alvarez
observed, "In this business, you have to be careful. It\'s a dangerous
business. You have to watch out for rip-offs and Federal agents."
Alvarez also stated that he would never go back to prison, and that he
would rather be dead than go back to prison. Alvarez\' statements
clearly implied that he contemplated the use of deadly force, if
necessary, to avoid a rip-off or apprehension by Federal agents. The
evidence also indicated that, immediately prior to the shoot-out, Simon
looked nervously out the window while fidgeting with a leather pouch
that was suspected to contain a weapon. The jury properly could take
this additional evidence into account in reaching its conclusion about
the foreseeability of the murder.

Because we find that the evidence in this case was more than sufficient
to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the murder was a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of the drug conspiracy alleged in the
indictment, we hold that the court did not err by submitting the
Pinkerton issue to the jury.

**3. Individual Culpability**

The three appellants also contend that, even if the murder was
reasonably foreseeable, their murder convictions nevertheless should be
reversed. The appellants argue that the murder was sufficiently distinct
from the intended purposes of the drug conspiracy, and that their
individual roles in the conspiracy were sufficiently minor, that they
should not be held responsible for the murder. We are not persuaded.

It is well established that, under the Pinkerton doctrine, "\[a\]
co-conspirator is vicariously liable for the acts of another
co-conspirator even though he may not have directly participated in
those acts, his role in the crime was minor, or the evidence against a
co-defendant more damaging."  Thus, in a typical Pinkerton case, the
court need not inquire into the individual culpability of a particular
conspirator, so long as the substantive crime was a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy.

We acknowledge that the instant case is not a typical Pinkerton case.
Here, the murder of Agent Rios was not within the originally intended
scope of the conspiracy, but instead occurred as a result of an
unintended turn of events. We have not found, nor has the government
cited, any authority for the proposition that all conspirators,
regardless of individual culpability, may be held responsible under
Pinkerton for reasonably foreseeable but originally unintended
substantive crimes. Furthermore, we are mindful of the potential due
process limitations on the Pinkerton doctrine in cases involving
attenuated relationships between the conspirator and the substantive
crime.

Nevertheless, these considerations do not require us to reverse the
murder convictions of Portal, Concepcion, and Hernandez, for we cannot
accept the three appellants\' assessment of their individual
culpability. All three were more than "minor"  participants in the drug
conspiracy. Portal served as a look-out in front of the Hurricane Motel
during part of the negotiations that led to the shoot-out, and the
evidence indicated that he was armed. Concepcion introduced the agents
to Alvarez, the apparent leader of the conspiracy, and was present when
the shoot-out started. Finally, Hernandez, the manager of the motel,
allowed the drug transactions to take place on the premises and acted as
a translator during part of the negotiations that led to the shoot-out.

In addition, all three appellants had actual knowledge of at least some
of the circumstances and events leading up to the murder. The evidence
that Portal was carrying a weapon demonstrated that he anticipated the
possible use of deadly force to protect the conspirators\' interests.
Moreover, both Concepcion and Hernandez were present when Alvarez stated
that he would rather be dead than go back to prison, indicating that
they, too, were aware that deadly force might be used to prevent
apprehension by Federal agents.

We find the individual culpability of Portal, Concepcion, and Hernandez
sufficient to support their murder convictions under Pinkerton, despite
the fact that the murder was not within the originally intended scope of
the conspiracy. In addition, based on the same evidence, we conclude
that the relationship between the three appellants and the murder was
not so attenuated as to run afoul of the potential due process
limitations on the Pinkerton doctrine. We therefore hold that Pinkerton
liability for the murder of Agent Rios properly was imposed on the three
appellants, and we decline to reverse their murder convictions on this
ground.\[27\]

\[27\] Although our decision today extends the Pinkerton doctrine to
cases involving reasonably foreseeable but originally unintended
substantive crimes, we emphasize that we do so only within narrow
confines. Our holding is limited to conspirators who played more than a
"minor" role in the conspiracy, or who had actual knowledge of at least
some of the circumstances and events culminating in the reasonably
foreseeable but originally unintended substantive crime.

MPC Sec. 2.06, Comment 6(a)

The most important point at which the Model Code formulation diverges
from the language of many courts is that it does not make "conspiracy"
as such a basis for complicity in substantive offenses committed in
furtherance of its aims. It asks, instead, more specific questions about
the behavior charged to constitute complicity, such as whether the
defendant solicited commission of the particular offense or whether he
aided, or agreed or attempted to aid, in its commission.

The reason for this treatment is that there appears to be no better way
to confine within reasonable limits, the scope of liability to which
conspiracy may theoretically give rise.

\[For example,\] in *United States v. Bruno*, eighty-eight defendants
were indicted for conspiracy to import, sell, and possess narcotics. The
evidence showed a large combination composed of four groups of persons:
the smugglers who imported the drugs; the middlemen who paid the
smugglers and disturbed to retailers; and two groups of retailers, one
in Texas and Louisiana and the other in New York. The Court held that
this evidence sustained a verdict that there was one large conspiracy in
which the members of each group were criminal participants. That
judgment commands support in a prosecution for conspiracy, and is one
that would follow from the application of the standards of Section 5.03
of this Code. But should it follow that each retailer in Texas commits
the offenses of each retailer in New York, though he has not promoted or
facilitated the commission and has no interest in them? Yet if the
conspiracy involved one combination, the commission of those crimes was
certainly included in its objects, and a traditionally worded inquiry
might lead to liability for them all.

Conspiracy may prove solicitation aid, or agreement to aid, etc.; it is
evidentially important and may be sufficient for that purpose. But
whether it suffices ought to be established by the jurors; they should
not be told that it establishes complicity as a matter of law.

Kotteakos v. United States\
Supreme Court of the United States\
328 U.S. 750 (1946)

The only question is whether petitioners have suffered substantial
prejudice from being convicted of a single general conspiracy by
evidence which the Government admits proved not one conspiracy but some
eight or more different ones of the same sort executed through a common
key figure, Simon Brown. Petitioners were convicted under the general
conspiracy section of the Criminal Code, 18 U. S. C. § 88, of conspiring
to violate the provisions of the National Housing Act. The judgments
were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari
because of the importance of the question for the administration of
criminal justice in the federal courts.

The indictment named thirty-two defendants, including the petitioners.
The gist of the conspiracy, as alleged, was that the defendants had
sought to induce various financial institutions to grant credit, with
the intent that the loans or advances would then be offered to the
Federal Housing Administration for insurance upon applications
containing false and fraudulent information.

Of the thirty-two persons named in the indictment nineteen were brought
to trial and the names of thirteen were submitted to the jury. Two were
acquitted; the jury disagreed as to four; and the remaining seven,
including petitioners, were found guilty.

The Government's evidence may be summarized briefly, for the petitioners
have not contended that it was insufficient, if considered apart from
the alleged errors relating to the proof and the instructions at the
trial.

Simon Brown, who pleaded guilty, was the common and key figure in all of
the transactions proven. He was president of the Brownie Lumber Company.
Having had experience in obtaining loans under the National Housing Act,
he undertook to act as broker in placing for others loans for
modernization and renovation, charging a five per cent commission for
his services. Brown knew, when he obtained the loans, that the proceeds
were not to be used for the purposes stated in the applications.

In May, 1939, petitioner Lekacos told Brown that he wished to secure a
loan in order to finance opening a law office, to say the least a hardly
auspicious professional launching. Brown made out the application, as
directed by Lekacos, to state that the purpose of the loan was to
modernize a house belonging to the estate of Lekacos' father. Lekacos
obtained the money. Later in the same year Lekacos secured another loan
through Brown, the application being in the names of his brother and
sister-in-law. Lekacos also received part of the proceeds of a loan for
which one Gerakeris, a defendant who pleaded guilty, had applied.

In June, 1939, Lekacos sent Brown an application for a loan signed by
petitioner Kotteakos. It contained false statements. Brown placed the
loan, and Kotteakos thereafter sent Brown applications on behalf of
other persons. Two were made out in the names of fictitious persons. The
proceeds were received by Kotteakos and petitioner Regenbogen, his
partner in the cigarette and pinball machine business. Regenbogen,
together with Kotteakos, had indorsed one of the applications. Kotteakos
also sent to Brown an application for a loan in Regenbogen's name. This
was for modernization of property not owned by Regenbogen. The latter,
however, repaid the money in about three months after he received it.

The evidence against the other defendants whose cases were submitted to
the jury was similar in character. They too had transacted business with
Brown relating to National Housing Act loans. But no connection was
shown between them, and petitioners, other than that Brown had been the
instrument in each instance for obtaining the loans. In many cases the
other defendants did not have any relationship with one another, other
than Brown's connection with each transaction. As the Circuit Court of
Appeals said, there were "at least eight, and perhaps more, separate and
independent groups, none of which had any connection with any other,
though all dealt independently with Brown as their agent." As the
Government puts it, the pattern was "that of separate spokes meeting in
a common center," though, we may add, without the rim of the wheel to
enclose the spokes.

The proof therefore admittedly made out a case, not of a single
conspiracy, but of several, notwithstanding only one was charged in the
indictment. The Court of Appeals aptly drew analogy in the comment,
"Thieves who dispose of their loot to a single receiver --- a single
'fence' --- do not by that fact alone become confederates: they may, but
it takes more than knowledge that he is a 'fence' to make them such." It
stated that the trial judge "was plainly wrong in supposing that upon
the evidence there could be a single conspiracy; and in the view which
he took of the law, he should have dismissed the indictment."
Nevertheless the appellate court held the error not prejudicial, saying
among other things that "especially since guilt was so manifest, it was
'proper' to join the conspiracies," and "to reverse the conviction would
be a miscarriage of justice." This is indeed the Government's entire
position. It does not now contend that there was no variance in proof
from the single conspiracy charged in the indictment. Admitting that
separate and distinct conspiracies were shown, it urges that the
variance was not prejudicial to the petitioners.

One difficulty with this is that the trial court itself was confused in
the charge which it gave to guide the jury in deliberation. The court
instructed:

> The indictment charges but one conspiracy, and to convict each of the
> defendants of a conspiracy the Government would have to prove, and you
> would have to find, that each of the defendants was a member of that
> conspiracy. You cannot divide it up. It is one conspiracy, and the
> question is whether or not each of the defendants, or which of the
> defendants, are members of that conspiracy.

On its face, as the Court of Appeals said, this portion of the charge
was plainly wrong in application to the proof made; and the error
pervaded the entire charge, not merely the portion quoted. The jury
could not possibly have found, upon the evidence, that there was only
one conspiracy. The trial court was of the view that one conspiracy was
made out by showing that each defendant was linked to Brown in one or
more transactions, and that it was possible on the evidence for the jury
to conclude that all were in a common adventure because of this fact and
the similarity of purpose presented in the various applications for
loans.

On those instructions it was competent not only for the jury to find
that all of the defendants were parties to a single common plan, design
and scheme, where none was shown by the proof, but also for them to
impute to each defendant the acts and statements of the others without
reference to whether they related to one of the schemes proven or
another, and to find an overt act affecting all in conduct which
admittedly could only have affected some. True, the Court of Appeals
painstakingly examined the evidence directly relating to each petitioner
and concluded he had not been prejudiced in this manner. That judgment
was founded largely in the fact that each was clearly shown to have
shared in the fraudulent phase of the conspiracy in which he
participated. Even so, we do not understand how it can be concluded, in
the face of the instruction, that the jury considered and was influenced
by nothing else.

Numbers are vitally important in trial, especially in criminal matters.
Guilt with us remains individual and personal, even as respects
conspiracies. It is not a matter of mass application. There are times
when of necessity, because of the nature and scope of the particular
federation, large numbers of persons taking part must be tried together
or perhaps not at all, at any rate as respects some. When many conspire,
they invite mass trial by their conduct. Even so, the proceedings are
exceptional to our tradition and call for use of every safeguard to
individualize each defendant in his relation to the mass. Wholly
different is it with those who join together with only a few, though
many others may be doing the same and though some of them may line up
with more than one group.

Criminal they may be, but it is not the criminality of mass conspiracy.
They do not invite mass trial by their conduct. Nor does our system
tolerate it. That way lies the drift toward totalitarian institutions.
True, this may be inconvenient for prosecution. But our Government is
not one of mere convenience or efficiency. It too has a stake, with
every citizen, in his being afforded our historic individual
protections, including those surrounding criminal trials. About them we
dare not become careless or complacent when that fashion has become
rampant over the earth.

Here toleration went too far.

United States v. Bruno

 

#### UNITED STATES v. BRUNO et al.

U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.\
105 F.2d 921 (1939)\
\
Before L.. HAND, AUGUSTUS N. HAND, and CLARK, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM.

Bruno and Iacono were indicted along with 86 others for a conspiracy to
import, sell and possess narcotics; some were acquitted; others, besides
these two, were convicted, but they alone appealed. They complain that
if the evidence proved anything, it proved a series of separate
conspiracies, and not a single one, as alleged in the indictment....

The first point was made at the conclusion of the prosecution's case:
the defendants then moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that
several conspiracies had been proved, and not the one alleged. The
evidence allowed the jury to find that there had existed over a
substantial period of time a conspiracy embracing a great number of
persons, whose object was to smuggle narcotics into the Port of New York
and distribute them to addicts both in this city and in Texas and
Louisiana. This required the cooperation of four groups of persons; the
smugglers who imported the drugs; the middlemen who paid the smugglers
and distributed to retailers; and two groups of retailers --- one in New
York and one in Texas and Louisiana--- who supplied the addicts. The
defendants assert that there were, therefore, at least three separate
conspiracies; one between the smugglers and the middlemen, and one
between the middlemen and each group of retailers.

 The evidence did not disclose any cooperation or communication between
the smugglers and either group of retailers, or between the two groups
of retailers themselves; however, the smugglers knew that the middlemen
must sell to retailers, and the retailers knew that the middlemen must
buy of importers of one sort or another. Thus the conspirators at one
end of the chain knew that the unlawful business would not, and could
not, stop with their buyers; and those at the other end knew that it had
not begun with their sellers. That being true, a jury might have found
that all the accused were embarked upon a venture, in all parts of which
each was a participant, and an abettor in the sense that the success of
that part with which he was immediately concerned, was dependent upon
the success of the whole. That distinguishes the situation from that in
*United States v. Peoni*, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 401, where Peoni, the
accused, did not know that Regno, his buyer, was to sell the counterfeit
bills to Dorsey, and had no interest in whether he did, since Regno
might equally well have passed them to innocent persons himself. It
might still be argued that there were two conspiracies; one including
the smugglers, the middlemen and the New York group, and the other, the
smugglers, the middlemen and the Texas & Louisiana group, for there was
apparently no privity between the two groups of retailers. That too
would be fallacious. Clearly, quoad the smugglers, there was but one
conspiracy, for it was of no moment to them whether the middlemen sold
to one or more groups of retailers, provided they had a market
somewhere. So too of any retailer; he knew that he was a necessary link
in a scheme of distribution, and the others, whom he knew to be
convenient to its execution, were as much parts of a single undertaking
or enterprise as two salesmen in the same shop. We think therefore that
there was only one conspiracy....
