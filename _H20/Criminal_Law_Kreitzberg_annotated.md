Headnote

Welcome to Criminal Law!

This casebook is the result of a collaboration by Professors Oberman and
Ball with a team of law students over the course of the pandemic summer
of 2020. This project aimed to redress some of the shortcomings of
conventional casebook approaches to criminal law. Too often, casebooks
surface issues of mental health, sex, gender, race and sexual
orientation without meaningful context to situate how these issues have
been treated by the criminal legal system, how they reflect social
norms, how they have changed over time, etc.). Too seldom do casebooks
invite a meaningful discussion of the role of race in the criminal legal
system.

One final note: We developed a second casebook, [Current Challenges in
Criminal
Law](../../../search/?type=casebooks&q=oberman&sort=display_name&author=&school=),
which we suggest using as a companion to this casebook. (Although it can
be used independently, of course). It features links to audio and video
content, keyed to the topics in the criminal law casebook.

\*We are deeply indebted to the following individuals, among others,
whose work helped constitute the foundation upon which we\'ve built:
Joshua Dressler; Stephen Garvey; Cynthia Lee; Angela Harris; Jeannie
Suk; Tim Wu; Amna Akbar, Alice Ristroph, Paul Butler, Allegra McLeod,
Jocelyn Simonson. Thanks to Karen Tani for telling us about the Open
Casebook platform! Thanks to our associate dean and colleague Mike
Flynn, who found time for our work amidst the chaos of leading our
school through the pandemic chaos. And thanks to our students and
co-authors, who are the driving force behind this project: Cydney
Chilimidos; Miriam Contreras; Jenai Howard; Christina Iriart; Angela
Madrigal; Leah Mesfin; Zachary Nemirovsky; Nicholas Newman; Nathanial
Perez; Michael Pons; and Phillip Yin.

Export Customization Tips

We designed this opencasebook.org export using MS Word Styles to
simplify customization. The \"Styles Pane\" in Word\'s \"Home\" tab
shows a list of styles in the document, and the active style of your
current element or selection.

For example, you can quickly change the case text font for the whole
document by modifying the \"Case Body\" style. The style modification
screen also shows which style your style is \"Based On.\" If you modify
the style listed there, all styles based on it will also change. Some
older documents might use different styles than newer ones--- click into
an element and check the Styles Pane to confirm its style.

Check out Microsoft\'s [extensive styles
documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-styles-advantage-in-word-b4a6372f-188c-93cb-831b-c4dd0cb3a881)
for the finer points and caveats.

**Remember:** style modifications can yield sweeping results that
aren\'t always apparent on the page you\'re viewing. Make a backup copy
of your document before experimenting.

Ewing v. California

 

Supreme Court of the United States

538 U.S. 11, 155 L. Ed. 2d 108, 123 S. Ct. 1179, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 1952,
SCDB 2002-028

No. 01-6978

2003-03-05

Argued November 5, 2002

Justice O'Connor

announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which
The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join.

In this case, we decide whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the State
of California from sentencing a repeat felon to a prison term of 25
years to life under the State's "Three Strikes and You're Out" law.

**\[ ... \]**

In October and November 1993, Ewing committed three burglaries and one
robbery at a Long Beach, California, apartment complex over a 5-week
period. He awakened one of his victims, asleep on her living room sofa,
as he tried to disconnect her video cassette recorder from the
television in that room. When she screamed, Ewing ran out the front
door. On another occasion, Ewing accosted a victim in the mailroom of
the apartment complex. Ewing claimed to have a gun and ordered the
victim to hand over his wallet. When the victim resisted, Ewing produced
a knife and forced the victim back to the apartment itself. While Ewing
rifled through the bedroom, the victim fled the apartment screaming for
help. Ewing absconded with the victim's money and credit cards.

On December 9,1993, Ewing was arrested on the premises of the apartment
complex for trespassing and lying to a police officer. The knife used in
the robbery and a glass cocaine pipe were later found in the back seat
of the patrol car used to transport Ewing to the police station. A jury
convicted Ewing of first-degree robbery and three counts of residential
burglary. Sentenced to nine years and eight months in prison, Ewing was
paroled in 1999.

Only 10 months later, Ewing stole the golf clubs at issue in this case.
He was charged with, and ultimately convicted of, one count of felony
grand theft of personal property in excess of \$400. See Cal. Penal Code
Ann. § 484 (West Supp. 2002); §489 (West 1999). As required by the three
strikes law, the prosecutor formally alleged, and the trial court later
found, that Ewing had been convicted previously of four serious or
violent felonies for the three burglaries and the robbery in the Long
Beach apartment complex. See § 667(g) (West 1999); § 1170.12(e) (West
Supp. 2002).

**\[ ... \]**

III

Against this backdrop, we consider Ewing's claim that his three strikes
sentence of 25 years to life is unconstitutionally disproportionate to
his offense of "shoplifting three golf clubs." **\[ ... \]**At the
threshold, we note that Ewing incorrectly frames the issue. The gravity
of his offense was not merely "shoplifting three golf clubs." Rather,
Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for- stealing nearly \$1,200
worth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at least
two "violent" or "serious" felonies. **\[ ... \]**

In weighing the gravity of Ewing's offense, we must place on the scales
not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony
recidivism. Any other approach would fail to accord proper deference to
the policy judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of
sanctions. In imposing a three strikes sentence, the State's interest is
not merely punishing the offense of conviction, or the "triggering"
offense: "\[I\]t is in addition the interest\... in dealing in a harsher
manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are
simply incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by
its criminal law." **\[ ... \]** To give full effect to the State's
choice of this legitimate penological goal, our proportionality review
of Ewing's sentence must take that goal into account.

Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in
incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons, and amply supported by
his own long, serious criminal record.[^1] Ewing has been convicted of
numerous misdemeanor and felony offenses, served nine separate terms of
incarceration, and committed most of his crimes while on probation or
parole. His prior "strikes" were serious felonies including robbery and
three residential burglaries. To be sure, Ewing's sentence is a long
one. But it reflects a rational legislative judgment, entitled to
deference, that offenders who have committed serious or violent felonies
and who continue to commit felonies must be incapacitated. The State of
California "was entitled to place upon \[Ewing\] the onus of one who is
simply unable to bring his conduct within the social norms prescribed by
the criminal law of the State." *Rummel, supra,* at 284. Ewing's is not
"the rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed
and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross
disproportion-ality." *Harmelin,* 501 U. S., at 1005 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

We hold that Ewing's sentence of 25 years to life in prison, imposed for
the offense of felony grand theft under the three strikes law, is not
grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The judgment
of the California Court of Appeal is affirmed.

**\[ ... \]**

Justice Scalia,

concurring in the judgment.

**\[ ... \]**

Proportionality --- the notion that the punishment should fit the crime
--- is inherently a concept tied to the penological goal of retribution.
"\[I\]t becomes difficult even to speak intelligently of
'proportionality,' once deterrence and rehabilitation are given
significant weight," *Harmelin, supra,* at 989 --- not to mention giving
weight to the purpose of California's three strikes law: incapacitation.
In the present case, the game is up once the plurality has acknowledged
that "the Constitution does not mandate adoption of any one penological
theory," and that a "sentence can have a variety of justifications, such
as incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, or rehabilitation." *Ante,*
at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). That acknowledgment having
been made, it no longer suffices merely to assess "the gravity of the
offense compared to the harshness of the penalty," *ante,* at 28; that
classic description of the proportionality principle (alone and in
itself quite resistant to policy-free, legal analysis) now becomes
merely the "first" step of the inquiry, *ibid.* Having completed that
step (by a discussion which, in all fairness, does not convincingly
establish that 25-years-to-life is a "proportionate" punishment for
stealing three golf clubs), the plurality must then *add* an analysis to
show that "Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety
interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons." *Ante,* at
29.

Which indeed it is --- though why that has anything to do with the
principle of proportionality is a mystery. Perhaps the plurality should
revise its terminology, so that what it reads into the Eighth Amendment
is not the unstated proposition that all punishment should be reasonably
proportionate to the gravity of the offense, but rather the unstated
proposition that all punishment should reasonably pursue the multiple
purposes of the criminal law. That formulation would make it clearer
than ever, of course, that the plurality is not applying law but
evaluating policy.

Because I agree that petitioner's sentence does not violate the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, I concur
in the judgment.

The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens

 

**THE QUEEN v. DUDLEY AND STEPHENS**

**December 9, 188\[ ... \]**

.

At the trial**\[ ... \]** the jury, at the suggestion of the learned
judge, found the facts of the case in a special verdict which stated

> "that, on July 5,1884, the prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edward

LORD COLERIDGE, C.J. The two prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edwin
Stephens, were indicted for the murder of Richard Parker on the high
seas on the 25th of July in the present year. They were tried before my
Brother Huddleston at Exeter on the 6th of November, and, under the
direction of my learned Brother, the jury returned a special verdict,
the legal effect of which has been argued before us, and on which we are
now to pronounce judgment**\[ ... \]**

From these facts, stated with the cold precision of a special verdict,
it appears sufficiently that the prisoners were subject to terrible
temptation, to sufferings which might break down the bodily power of the
strongest man, and try the conscience of the best. Other details yet
more harrowing, facts still more loathsome and appalling, were presented
to the jury, and are to be found recorded in my learned Brother\'s
notes. But nevertheless this is clear, that the prisoners put to death a
weak and unoffending boy upon the chance of preserving their own lives
by feeding upon his flesh and blood after he was killed, and with the
certainty of depriving him, of any possible chance of survival. The
verdict finds in terms that \"if the men had not fed upon the body of
the boy they would probably not have survived,\" and that "the boy being
in a much weaker condition was likely to have died before them.\" They
might possibly have been picked up next day by a passing ship; they
might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is
obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and
profitless act. It is found by the verdict that the boy was incapable of
resistance, and, in fact, made none; and it is not even suggested that
his death was due to any violence on his part attempted against, or even
so much as feared by, those who killed him. Under these circumstances
the jury say that they are ignorant whether those who killed him were
guilty of murder, and have referred it to this Court to determine what
is the legal consequence which follows from the facts which they have
found**\[ ... \]**

.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

There remains to be considered the real question in the case whether
killing under the circumstances set forth in the verdict be or be not
murder. **\[ ... \]**.**\[ ... \]**. First it is said that it follows
from various definitions of murder in books of authority, which
definitions imply, if they do not state, the doctrine, that in order to
save your own life you may lawfully take away the life of another, when
that other is neither attempting nor threatening yours, nor is guilty of
any illegal act whatever towards you or any one else. But if these
definitions be looked at they will not be found to sustain this
contention.**\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

"If a man be desperately assaulted and in peril of death, and cannot
otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his assailant\'s fury, he will kill
an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force will not
acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit the fact,
for he ought rather to die himself than kill an innocent; but if he
cannot otherwise save his own life the law permits him in his own
defence to kill the assailant, for by the violence of the assault, and
the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself, the law of
nature, and necessity, hath made him his own protector cum debito modera
mine inculpatee tutelae.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. i. 51.)

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and
unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified
by some well-recognised excuse admitted by the law. It is further
admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing
was justified by what has been called "necessity." But the temptation to
the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called
necessity. Nor is this to be regretted. Though law and morality are not
the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily
illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal
consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder
in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it. It is not
so. To preserve one\'s life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be
the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of
instances in which it is a man\'s duty not to live, but to die. The
duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the
passengers, **\[ ... \]** these duties impose on men the moral
necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives
for others from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in
England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk. It is
not correct, therefore, to say that there is any absolute or unqualified
necessity to preserve one\'s life. **\[ ... \]**It is not needful to
point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been
contended for. Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity? By what
measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to be
strength, or intellect, or \'what? It is plain that the principle leaves
to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which will
justify him in deliberately taking another\'s life to save his own. In
this case the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting, was chosen.
Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? The answer
must be \"No\" --

It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an
excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how
awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment
straight and the conduct pure. We are often compelled to set up
standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we
could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare
temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it,
nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner
the legal definition of the crime. It is therefore our duty to declare
that the prisoners\' act in this case was wilful murder, that the facts
as stated in the verdict are no legal justification of the homicide; and
to say that in our unanimous opinion the prisoners are upon this special
verdict guilty of
murder.[^\[2\]^](#Xb703a988661a8f6160f16861506a6f47371d48f)

Commonwealth v. Mochan

 

177 Pa. Superior Ct. 454 (1955)

### Commonwealth v. Mochan, Appellant.

Superior Court of Pennsylvania.

Argued November 8, 1954.

January 14, 1955.

 

**\[ ... \]**

OPINION BY HIRT, J., January 14, 1955:

One indictment (Bill 230), before us in the present appeals, charged
that the defendant on May 4, 1953 \"**\[ ... \]**unlawfully, wickedly
and maliciously did **\[ ... \]**make numerous telephone calls to the
dwelling house of **\[ ... \]** Louise Zivkovich at all times of the day
and night, in which **\[ ... \]** Michael Mochan did wickedly and
maliciously refer to **\[ ... \]** Louise Zivkovich as a lewd, immoral
and lascivious woman of an indecent and lewd character, and other
scurrilous approbrious, filthy, disgusting and indecent language and
talk **\[ ... \]**, not only with **\[ ... \]**Louise Zivkovich **\[ ...
\]**but with other members of the family of **\[ ... \]**Louise
Zivkovich **\[ ... \]**to the great damage, injury and oppression of
**\[ ... \]** Louise Zivkovich and other good citizens of this
Commonwealth **\[ ... \]**against the peace and dignity of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\" A second indictment (Bill 231), in the
same language, charged a like offense committed by defendant on another
date. Defendant was tried before a judge without a jury and was
convicted on both charges and was \[457\] sentenced. He has appealed
from the refusal by the court en banc of his motions in arrest of
judgment, on the ground advanced by him that the conduct charged in the
indictments, concededly not a criminal offense in this State by any
statute, does not constitute a misdemeanor at common law. In a number of
States and especially in the common law State of Pennsylvania the common
law of England, as to crimes, is in force except in so far as it has
been abrogated by statute. 11 Am. Jur., Common Law, § 4; 22 C.J.S.,
Criminal Law, § 19. The indictments in these cases by their language,
clearly purported to charge a common law crime not included in our Penal
Code or elsewhere in our statutory law.

It is established by the testimony that the defendant over a period of
more than one month early in 1953, on numerous occasions and on the
specific dates laid in the indictments, telephoned one Louise Zivkovich,
a stranger to him and a married woman of the highest character and
repute. He called as often as three times each week and at any hour of
the day or night. His language on these calls was obscene, lewd and
filthy. He not only suggested intercourse with her but talked of sodomy
as well, in the loathsome language of that criminal act, on a number of
occasions. **\[ ... \]**

It is of little importance that there is no precedent in our reports
which decides the precise question here involved. The test is not
whether precedents can be \[458\] found in the books but whether the
alleged crimes could have been prosecuted and the offenders punished
under the common law. *Commonwealth v. McHale,* 97 Pa. 397, 408. In
*Commonwealth v. Miller,* 94 Pa. Superior Ct. 499, 507, the controlling
principles are thus stated: \"The common law is sufficiently broad to
punish as a misdemeanor, although there may be no exact precedent, any
act which directly injures or tends to injure the public to such an
extent as to require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer, as
in the case of acts which injuriously affect public morality, or
obstruct, or pervert public justice, or the administration of
government: **\[ ... \]** Cf. *Com. of Penna. v. DeGrange,* 97 Pa.
Superior Ct. 181, in which it is said: \"\`Whatever openly outrages
decency and is injurious to public morals is a misdemeanor at common
law\': Russell on Crimes and Misdemeanors, 8th Ed., Vol. 1, p. 10; 4
Blackstone\'s Commentaries 65, note.\" Any act is indictable at common
law which from its nature scandalously affects the morals or health of
the community. 1 Wharton Criminal Law, 12 Ed., § 23. Thus in *Barker et
al. v. Commonwealth,* 19 Pa. 412, a common law conviction based upon
open obscenity was affirmed. **\[ ... \]** And as early as *Updegraph v.
Commonwealth,* 11 S. & R. 393, it was held that Christianity is a part
of the common law and maliciously to vilify the Christian religion is an
indictable offense.

\[459\] To endeavor merely to persuade a married woman to commit
adultery is not indictable. *Smith v. Commonwealth,* 54 Pa. 209. The
present defendant\'s criminal intent was evidenced by a number of overt
acts beyond the mere oral solicitation of adultery. The vile and
disgusting suggestions of sodomy alone and the otherwise persistent
lewd, immoral and filthy language used by the defendant, take these
cases out of the principle of the *Smith* case. Moreover potentially at
least, defendant\'s acts injuriously affected public morality. The
operator or any one on defendant\'s four-party telephone line could have
listened in on the conversations, and at least two other persons in Mrs.
Zivkovich\'s household heard some of defendant\'s immoral and obscene
language over the telephone.

The name \"Immoral Practices and Conduct\" was ascribed to the offense
and was endorsed on the indictments by the District Attorney. Whether
the endorsement appropriately or adequately names the offense is
unimportant (*Com. of Penna. v. DeGrange,* supra, p. 185); the factual
charges in the body of the indictments identify the offense as a common
law misdemeanor and the testimony established the guilt of the
defendant.

Judgments and sentences affirmed.

DISSENTING OPINION BY WOODSIDE, J.:

Not unmindful of the reprehensible conduct of the appellant, I
nevertheless cannot agree with the majority that what he did was a crime
punishable under the laws of this Commonwealth.

The majority is declaring something to be a crime which was never before
known to be a crime in this Commonwealth. They have done this by the
application \[460\] of such general principles as \"it is a crime to do
anything which injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent
as to require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer;\" and
\"whatever openly outrages decency and is injurious to public morals is
a misdemeanor.\"

Not only have they declared it to be a crime to do an act \"injuriously
affecting public morality,\" but they have declared it to be a crime to
do any act which has a \"potentially\" injurious effect on public
morality.

Under the division of powers in our constitution it is for the
legislature to determine what \"injures or tends to injure the public.\"

One of the most important functions of a legislature is to determine
what acts \"require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer.\"
There is no reason for the legislature to enact any criminal laws if the
courts delegate to themselves the power to apply such general principles
as are here applied to whatever conduct may seem to the courts to be
injurious to the public.

There is no doubt that the common law is a part of the law of this
Commonwealth, and we punish many acts under the common law. But after
nearly two hundred years of constitutional government in which the
legislature and not the courts have been charged by the people with the
responsibility of deciding which acts do and which do not injure the
public to the extent which requires punishment, it seems to me we are
making an unwarranted invasion of the legislative field when we arrogate
that responsibility to ourselves by declaring now, for the first time,
that certain acts are a crime.

When the legislature invades either the judicial or the executive
fields, or the executive invades either the judicial or legislative
fields, the courts stand ready to \[461\] stop them. But in matters of
this type there is nothing to prevent our invasion of the legislative
field except our own self restraint. There are many examples of how
carefully the courts, with admirable self restraint, have fenced
themselves in so they would not romp through the fields of the other
branches of government. This case is not such an example.

Until the legislature says that what the defendant did is a crime, I
think the courts should not declare it to be such.

I would therefore reverse the lower court and discharge the appellant.

Supreme Court of the United States

### CITY OF CHICAGO v. MORALES et al.

No. 97-1121.

United States Supreme Court.

Argued December 9, 1998.

Decided June 10, 1999.

**\[ ... \]**

\[45\] Justice Stevens announced the judgment of the Court **\[ ... \]**

In 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation
Ordinance, which prohibits \"criminal street gang \[46\] members\" from
\"loitering\" with one another or with other persons in any public
place. The question presented is whether the Supreme Court of Illinois
correctly held that the ordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

## 

## I

Before the ordinance was adopted, the city council\'s Committee on
Police and Fire conducted hearings to explore the problems created by
the city\'s street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of
public loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the
neighborhoods where gang members are most active, as well as some of the
aldermen who represent those areas. Based on that evidence, the council
made a series of findings that are included in the text of the ordinance
and explain the reasons for its
enactment.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xc40afd4e36aa72b46775cc9ab92ee198e69833e)

The council found that a continuing increase in criminal street gang
activity was largely responsible for the city\'s rising murder rate, as
well as an escalation of violent and drug related crimes. It noted that
in many neighborhoods throughout the city, \"\`the burgeoning presence
of street gang members in public places has intimidated many law abiding
citizens.\' \" 177 Ill. 2d 440, 445, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 58 (1997).
Furthermore, the council stated that gang members \"\`establish control
over identifiable areas . . . by loitering in those areas and
intimidating others from entering those areas; and . . . \[m\]embers of
criminal street gangs avoid arrest by committing no offense punishable
under existing laws when they know the police are present . . . .\' \"
*Ibid.* It further found that \"\`loitering in public places by \[47\]
criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear for the safety
of persons and property in the area\' \" and that \"\`\[a\]ggressive
action is necessary to preserve the city\'s streets and other public
places so that the public may use such places without fear.\' \"
Moreover, the council concluded that the city \"\`has an interest in
discouraging all persons from loitering in public places with criminal
gang members.\' \" *Ibid.*

The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to
\$500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and a requirement to
perform up to 120 hours of community service. Commission of the offense
involves four predicates. First, the police officer must reasonably
believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a
\"\`public place\' \" is a \"\`criminal street gang membe\[r\].\' \"
Second, the persons must be \"\`loitering,\' \" which the ordinance
defines as \"\`remain\[ing\] in any one place with no apparent
purpose.\' \" Third, the officer must then order \"\`all\' \" of the
persons to disperse and remove themselves \"\`from the area.\' \"
Fourth, a person must disobey the officer\'s order. If any person,
whether a gang member or not, disobeys the officer\'s order, that person
is guilty of violating the ordinance.

## II

During the three years of its
enforcement,[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xd37125fb603b8c1ff9411bcf55d8e0bde7478ac)the
police issued over 89,000 dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000
people for violating the
ordinance.[^\[7\]^](#Xd1a9786958e3f7c2cf29d2cd26f04a04c375a64) **\[ ...
\]**In respondent Youkhana\'s case, the trial judge held that the
\"ordinance fails to notify individuals what conduct \[50\] is
prohibited, and it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement by
police.\"[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xa24a377d5007c36dded5c0ddecbccbec1e8f48a)

**\[ ... \]**

The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed. It held \"that the gang loitering
ordinance violates due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague
on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.\" 177
Ill. 2d, at 447, 687 N. E. 2d, at 59. **\[ ... \]**

In support of its vagueness holding, the court pointed out that the
definition of \"loitering\" in the ordinance drew no distinction between
innocent conduct and conduct calculated \[51\] to cause
harm.[^\[14\]^](#X974b22a9b7389e967b78266e6d1f99b90e3c5a0) \"Moreover,
the definition of \`loiter\' provided by the ordinance does not assist
in clearly articulating the proscriptions of the ordinance.\" *Id.,* at
451-452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 60-61. Furthermore, it concluded that the
ordinance was \"not reasonably susceptible to a limiting construction
which would affirm its
validity.\"[^\[15\]^](#X1880f6c10bf677e29c95e8e5ad23320a8e46501)

We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1071 (1998), and now affirm. Like the
Illinois Supreme Court, we conclude that the ordinance enacted by the
city of Chicago is unconstitutionally vague.

## 

## III

The basic factual predicate for the city\'s ordinance is not in dispute.
As the city argues in its brief, \"the very presence of a large
collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and
hangers-on on the public ways intimidates residents, who become afraid
even to leave their homes and go about their business. That, in turn,
imperils community residents\' sense of safety and security, detracts
from property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire
neighborhoods.\"[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xb58d0695005a496b1c36b2cfc0199f1db2c66de)The
findings in the ordinance explain that it was motivated by these
concerns. We have no doubt \[52\] that a law that directly prohibited
such intimidating conduct would be
constitutional,[^\[17\]^](#X8429176902ea48fcfa46136e04d7a1fede435ad) but
this ordinance broadly covers a significant amount of additional
activity. Uncertainty about the scope of that additional coverage
provides the basis for respondents\' claim that the ordinance is too
vague.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

\[56\] Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two
independent reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind of notice
that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it
prohibits; second, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement. **\[ ... \]**

## 

## IV

\"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due
Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the
public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits . . . .\" *Giaccio* v.
*Pennsylvania,* 382 U. S. 399, 402-403 (1966). **\[ ... \]** It is
difficult to imagine how \[57\] any citizen of the city of Chicago
standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or
she had an \"apparent purpose.\" If she were talking to another person,
would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her
watch and looking expectantly down the street, would she have an
apparent purpose?[^\[23\]^](#X26ff5aed361b73d87e3815abb77068331e60811)

Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each
instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness
that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the
normal meaning of \"loitering,\" but rather about what loitering is
covered by the ordinance and what is not. **\[ ... \]**

The city\'s principal response to this concern about adequate notice is
that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after they have failed
to comply with an officer\'s order to disperse. \"\[W\]hatever problem
is created by a law that criminalizes conduct people normally believe to
be innocent is solved when persons receive actual notice from a police
order of what they are expected to
do.\"[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#X6ddfc44079408bdb04e4c17dea93b2149ab8800) We
find this response unpersuasive for at least two reasons.

**\[ ... \]**Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to
criminal sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the
loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to
prohibit.[^\[28\]^](#X98d75d1c8ca97407e28737bae8a841dcef5e7f3) If the
loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal order itself
is an unjustified impairment of liberty. **\[ ... \]**

Second, the terms of the dispersal order **\[ ... \]** provides that the
officer \"shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves
from the area.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. This vague phrasing raises
a host of questions. After such an order issues, how long must the
loiterers remain apart? How far must they move? If each loiterer walks
around the block and they meet again at the same location, are they
subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again? **\[ ...
\]**

Lack of clarity in the description of the loiterer\'s duty to obey a
dispersal order might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally \[60\]
vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear, but it does
buttress our conclusion that the entire ordinance fails to give the
ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is
permitted. The Constitution does not permit a legislature to \"set a net
large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts
to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should
be set at large.\" *United States* v. *Reese,* 92 U. S. 214, 221 (1876).
This ordinance is therefore vague \"not in the sense that it requires a
person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible
normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct
is specified at all.\" *Coates* v. *Cincinnati,* 402 U. S. 611, 614
(1971).

## 

## V

The broad sweep of the ordinance also violates \"\`the requirement that
a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\'
\" *Kolender* v. *Lawson,* 461 U. S., at 358. **\[ ... \]**It matters
not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example,
might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to
get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if
their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may---
indeed, she \"shall\"---order them to disperse.

Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of
innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its language to determine if it
\"necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the
policeman on his beat.\" *Kolender* v. *Lawson,* **\[ ... \]**the
principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this
case is the definition of loitering as \"to remain in any one place with
no apparent purpose.\"

As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it \"provides
absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities
constitute loitering.\" 177 Ill. 2d, at 457, 687 N. E. 2d, at 63. **\[
... \]**

Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance not
only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also has the
perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage much of the
intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the city
council\'s findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is
motivated either by an apparent purpose to publicize the gang\'s
dominance of certain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by
an equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in illegal
drugs. **\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is

*Affirmed.*

**\[ ... \]**

[**\[ ... \]**](#Xc43411c25dc0be56b0ee174c104905c46f3d1e0)

[\[2\]](#X67c2d8252328d12a88ad3fe8196ed9791366ef0) The ordinance states
in pertinent part:

\"(a) Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably
believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public
place with one or more other persons, he shall order all such persons to
disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person who does not
promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section.

\"(b) It shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of this
section that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a member
of a criminal street gang.

\"(c) As used in this Section:

\"(1) \`Loiter\' means to remain in any one place with no apparent
purpose.

\"(2) \`Criminal street gang\' means any ongoing organization,
association in fact or group of three or more persons, whether formal or
informal, having as one of its substantial activities the commission of
one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in paragraph (3), and whose
members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a
pattern of criminal gang activity.

. . . . .

\"(5) \`Public place\' means the public way and any other location open
to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.

\"(e) Any person who violates this Section is subject to a fine of not
less than \$100 and not more than \$500 for each offense, or
imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

\"In addition to or instead of the above penalties, any person who
violates this section may be required to perform up to 120 hours of
community service pursuant to section 1-4---120 of this Code.\" Chicago
Municipal Code § 8-4---015 (added June 17, 1992), reprinted in App. to
Pet. for Cert. 61a---63a.

The city believes that the ordinance resulted in a significant decline
in gang-related homicides. It notes that in 1995, the last year the
ordinance was enforced, the gang-related homicide rate fell by 26%. In
1996, after the ordinance had been held invalid, the gang-related
homicide rate rose 11%. Pet. for Cert. 9, n. 5. However, gang-related
homicides fell by 19% in 1997, over a year after the suspension of the
ordinance. Daley & Hillard, at 5. Given the myriad factors that
influence levels of violence, it is difficult to evaluate the probative
value of this statistical evidence, or to reach any firm conclusion
about the ordinance\'s efficacy. Cf. Harcourt, Reflecting on the
Subject: A Critique of the Social Influence Conception of Deterrence,

Style, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 291, 296 (1998) (describing the \"hotly

decline in crime in New York City and nationally\").

Desertrain v. City of Los Angeles

 

United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

754 F.3d 1147

No. 11-56957

2014-06-19

Argued and Submitted Dec. 5, 2013.

OPINION

PREGERSON, Circuit Judge:

This 42 U.S.C. § 1983 case concerns the constitutionality of Los Angeles
Municipal Code Section 85.02, which prohibits use of a vehicle "as
living quarters either overnight, day-by-day, or otherwise." Plaintiffs
include four homeless individuals who parked their vehicles in the
Venice area of Los Angeles and were cited and arrested for violating
Section 85.02. Defendants are the City of Los Angeles and individual
LAPD officers. Plaintiffs argue that Section 85.02 is unconstitutionally
vague on its face because it provides insufficient notice of the conduct
it penalizes and promotes arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. We
agree.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

I. Section 85.02 and the Venice Homelessness Task Force

In 1983, the City of Los Angeles enacted Municipal Code Section 85.02:

> USE OF STREETS AND PUBLIC PARKING LOTS FOR HABITATION.
>
> No person shall use a vehicle parked or standing upon any City street,
> or upon any parking lot owned by the City of Los Angeles and under the
> control of the City of Los Angeles or under control of the Los Angeles
> County Department of Beaches and Harbors, as living quarters either
> overnight, day-by-day, or otherwise.

On September 23, 2010, Los Angeles officials held a "Town Hall on
Homelessness" to address complaints of homeless individuals with
vehicles living on local streets in Venice. **\[ ... \]**City officials
repeated throughout the meeting that their concern was not homelessness
generally, but the illegal dumping of trash and human waste on city
streets that was endangering public health. To address this concern,
officials announced a renewed commitment to enforcing Section 85.02.

Within the week, the LAPD created the Venice Homelessness Task Force
(the "Task Force"). The Task Force's twenty-one officers were to use
Section 85.02 to cite and arrest homeless people using their automobiles
as "living quarters," and were also to distribute to such people
information concerning providers of shelter and other social services.

**\[ ... \]**Task Force officers received informal, verbal training, as
well as internal policy memoranda, on how to enforce Section 85.02.
Supervisors instructed officers to look for vehicles containing
possessions normally found in a home, such as food, bedding, clothing,
medicine, and basic necessities. According to those instructions, an
individual need not be sleeping or have slept in the vehicle to violate
Section 85.02. **\[ ... \]**

II\. Enforcement of Section 85.02

Beginning in late 2010, the Task Force began enforcing Section 85.02
against homeless individuals. Four such homeless individuals are
Plaintiffs in this case:[^2]

Plaintiff Steve Jaeobs-Elstein ran his own legal temp company for almost
ten years before losing his business and his home in the economic
downturn of 2007. **\[ ... \]**

When Jaeobs-Elstein first became homeless, he slept in his car. In
mid-2009, an LAPD officer approached Jaeobs-Elstein while parked on a
city street, warning him that if he slept in his vehicle at night on
public streets he would be arrested. At the time, Jaeobs-Elstein was
unaware that such conduct was unlawful. He then looked up Section 85.02
on the Internet and, based on what he read and what the officer told
him, understood Section 85.02 to mean that he could not sleep in his car
on a public street in Los Ange-les. He began sleeping at motels and on
other private property, and soon obtained permission from a Methodist
Church in Venice to sleep in his car while it was parked in the church
parking lot, provided he leave the lot by 8:00 a.m. each day. He also
registered with the People Assisting The Homeless's "Venice Vehicles to
Homes" program, secured a spot on the housing wait lists maintained by
the Department of Mental Health and the Los Angeles Housing Authority,
and was approved for a Section 8 housing voucher through the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.

**\[ ... \]**

On the morning of October 31, 2010, Jaeobs-Elstein was exiting his car
when Officer Gonzales and her partner detained, handcuffed, and arrested
Jaeobs-Elstein for violating Section 85.02. The car contained personal
belongings, such as boxes and computer equipment, as well as plastic
bottles of urine. **\[ ... \]**

On January 30, 2011, Defendant Officer Yoshioka and his partner cited
Jacobs-Elstein again for violating Section 85.02, this time while
Jacobs-Elstein was sitting in his car, talking on his cell phone.
Jacobs-Elstein had dog food in the car. He told Officer Yoshioka the dog
food was from a friend whose dog he would later take to the park. The
car also contained salad boxes, water bottles, a portable radio, and
bags of clothes. Jacobs-Elstein showed Officer Yoshioka proof that he
resided on private property, and thus was not sleeping in his vehicle.
Officer Yoshio-ka informed him that he need not sleep in his car to
violate Section 85.02.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

II\. Section 85.02 is unconstitutionally vague.

A statute fails under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
"if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain
as to the conduct it prohibits\.... " *Giaccio v. Pennsylvania,* 382
U.S. 399, 402, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966). A statute is vague
on its face when "no standard of conduct is specified at all. As a
result, men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its
meaning." *Coates v. City of Cincinnati* 402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct.
1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted).

"Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent
reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will
enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second,
it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement." *Morales,* 527 U.S. at 56, 119 S.Ct. 1849 (citation
omitted). Section 85.02 fails under both standards.

A. Section 85.02 fails to provide adequate notice of the conduct it
criminalizes.

"\[T\]he purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the
ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law." *Id.* at 58,
119 S.Ct. 1849. A penal statute cannot require the public to speculate
as to its meaning while risking life, liberty, and property in the
process. *See Lanzetta v. New Jersey,* 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618,
83 L.Ed. 888 (1939).

Section 85.02 offers no guidance as to what conduct it prohibits,
inducing precisely this type of impermissible speculation and
uncertainty. It states that no person shall use a vehicle "as living
quarters either overnight, day-by-day, or otherwise." Yet the statute
does not define "living quarters," or specify how long---or when--- is
"otherwise." We know that under Defendants' enforcement practices
sleeping in a vehicle is not required to violate Section 85.02, as
Jacobs-Elstein learned, **\[ ... \]**But there is no way to know what
*is* required to violate Section 85.02.

Instead, Plaintiffs are left guessing as to what behavior would subject
them to citation and arrest by an officer. Is it impermissible to eat
food in a vehicle? Is it illegal to keep a sleeping bag? Canned food?
Books? What about speaking on a cell phone? Or staying in the car to get
out of the rain? These are all actions Plaintiffs were taking when
arrested for violation of the ordinance, all of which are otherwise
perfectly legal. And despite Plaintiffs' repeated\' attempts to comply
with Section 85.02, there appears to be nothing they can do to avoid
violating the statute short of discarding all of their possessions or
their vehicles, or leaving Los Angeles entirely. All in all, this broad
and cryptic statute criminalizes innocent behavior, making it impossible
for citizens to know how to keep their conduct within the pale.

In this respect, Section 85.02 presents the same vagueness concerns as
the anti-loitering ordinance held unconstitutional in *Morales,* **\[
... \]**as it was "difficult to imagine how any citizen \... standing in
a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an
'apparent purpose.' " *Id.* at 56-57, 119 S.Ct. 1849.

So too here. It is difficult to imagine how anyone loading up his or her
car with personal belongings, perhaps to go on a camping trip or to
donate household wares to the Salvation Army, and parking briefly on a
Los Angeles street, would know if he or she was violating the statute.
What's worse, even avoiding parking does not seem to be sufficient;
Plaintiff Warivon-chik was not even parked---she was driving her RV
through Venice when she was pulled over and issued a warning. So, under
the Task Force's expansive reading of this already amorphous statute,
any vacationer who drives through Los Angeles in an RV may be violating
Section 85.02. As "the \[C\]ity cannot conceivably have meant to
criminalize each instance a citizen" uses a vehicle to store personal
property, vagueness about what is covered and what is not "dooms this
ordinance." *Id.* at 57, 119 S.Ct. 1849.

Because Section 85.02 fails to draw a clear line between innocent and
criminal conduct, it is void for vagueness.

B. Section 85.02 promotes arbitrary enforcement that targets the
homeless.

A statute is also unconstitutionally vague if it encourages arbitrary or
discriminatory enforcement. *See Papachristou,* 405 U.S. at 162, 92
S.Ct. 839. If a statute provides "no standards governing the exercise of
\... discretion," it becomes "a convenient tool for harsh and
discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against
particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure." *Id.* at 170, 92
S.Ct. 839 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is exactly what has occurred
here. As noted, Section 85.02 is broad enough to cover any driver in Los
Angeles who eats food or transports personal belongings in his or her
vehicle. Yet it appears to be applied only to the homeless. The
vagueness doctrine is designed specifically to prevent this type of
selective enforcement, in which a " 'net \[can\] be cast at large, to
enable men to be caught who are vaguely undesirable in the eyes of the
police and prosecution, although not chargeable in any particular
offense.'" *Id.* at 166, 92 S.Ct. 839 (quoting *Winters v. New York,*
333 U.S. 507, 540, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948) (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting)).

Section 85.02 raises the same concerns of discriminatory enforcement as
the ordinance in *Papachristou,* 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839. There, the
Supreme Court held that a city ordinance prohibiting "vagrancy"---which
was applied to "loitering," "prowling," and "nightwalking," among other
conduct---was unconstitutionally vague. *Id.* at 158, 163, 92 S.Ct. 839.
The Court viewed the ordinance in its historical context as the
descendant of English feudal poor laws designed to prevent the physical
movement and economic ascension of the lower class. *Id.* at 161-62, 92
S.Ct. 839. In America, such laws had been used to "roundup \...
so-called undesirea-bles," and resulted "in a regime in which the poor
and the unpopular \[we\]re permitted to stand on a public sidewalk \...
only at the whim of any police officer." *Id.* at 170, 171, 92 S.Ct. 839
(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court concluded that "the rule
of law implies equality and justice in its application. Vagrancy laws
\... teach that the scales of justice are so tipped that even-handed
administration of the law is not possible. The rule of law, evenly
applied to minorities as well as majorities, to the poor as well as the
rich, is the great mucilage that holds society together." *Id.* at 171,
92 S.Ct. 839.

The City argues that its enforcement goals were motivated by legitimate
health and safety concerns. It notes that some of the plaintiffs were
arrested while in cars with garbage, pets, and their personal
belongings, and that it was unsafe for plaintiffs to occupy their cars
under these circumstances. We do not question the legitimacy of these
public health and safety issues, but the record plainly shows that some
of the conduct plaintiffs were engaged in when arrested---eating,
talking on the phone, or escaping the rain in their vehicles---mimics
the everyday conduct of many Los Angeles residents. The health and
safety concerns cited by the City do not excuse the basic infirmity of
the ordinance: It is so vague that it fails to give notice of the
conduct it actually prohibits. As shown by the City's own documents, the
different ways the ordinance was interpreted by members of the police
department make it incompatible with the concept of an even-handed
administration of the law to the poor and to the rich that is
fundamental to a democratic society.

**\[ ... \]**

In sum, Section 85.02 has paved the way for law enforcement to target
the homeless and is therefore unconstitutionally vague.

## Justice Breyer**\[ ... \]** delivered the opinion of the Court.

A provision in the firearms chapter of the federal criminal code imposes
a 5-year mandatory prison term upon a person who \"uses or carries a
firearm\" \"during and in relation to\" a \"drug trafficking crime.\" 18
U. S. C. § 924(c)(1). The question before us is whether the phrase
\"carries a firearm\" is limited to the carrying of firearms on the
person. We hold that it is not so limited. Rather, it also applies to a
person \[127\] who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a
vehicle, including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car,
which the person accompanies.

## I

The question arises in two cases, which we have consolidated for
argument. Petitioner in the first case, Frank J. Muscarello, unlawfully
sold marijuana, which he carried in his truck to the place of sale.
Police officers found a handgun locked in the truck\'s glove
compartment. During plea proceedings, Muscarello admitted that he had
\"carried\" the gun \"for protection in relation\" to the drug offense,
App. in No. 96-1654, p. 12, though he later claimed to the contrary, and
added that, in any event, his \"carr\[ying\]\" of the gun in the glove
compartment did not fall within the scope of the statutory word
\"carries.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-1654, p. 10a.

Petitioners in the second case, Donald Cleveland and Enrique
Gray-Santana, placed several guns in a bag, put the bag in the trunk of
a car, and then traveled by car to a proposed drug-sale point, where
they intended to steal drugs from the sellers. Federal agents at the
scene stopped them, searched the cars, found the guns and drugs, and
arrested them.

In both cases the Courts of Appeals found that petitioners had
\"carrie\[d\]\" the guns during and in relation to a drug trafficking
offense. 106 F. 3d 636, 639 (CA5 1997); 106 F. 3d 1056, 1068 (CA1 1997).
We granted certiorari to determine whether the fact that the guns were
found in the locked glove compartment, or the trunk, of a car precludes
application of § 924(c)(1). We conclude that it does not.

## II

## A

We begin with the statute\'s language. The parties vigorously contest
the ordinary English meaning of the phrase \[128\] \"carries a
firearm.\" Because they essentially agree that Congress intended the
phrase to convey its ordinary, and not some special legal, meaning, and
because they argue the linguistic point at length, we too have looked
into the matter in more than usual depth. Although the word \"carry\"
has many different meanings, only two are relevant here. When one uses
the word in the first, or primary, meaning, one can, as a matter of
ordinary English, \"carry firearms\" in a wagon, car, truck, or other
vehicle that one accompanies. When one uses the word in a different,
rather special, way, to mean, for example, \"bearing\" or (in slang)
\"packing\" (as in \"packing a gun\"), the matter is less clear. But,
for reasons we shall set out below, we believe Congress intended to use
the word in its primary sense and not in this latter, special way.

Consider first the word\'s primary meaning. The Oxford English
Dictionary gives as its *first* definition \"convey, originally by cart
or wagon, hence in any vehicle, by ship, on horseback, etc.\" 2 Oxford
English Dictionary 919 (2d ed. 1989); see also Webster\'s Third New
International Dictionary 343 (1986) (*first* definition: \"move while
supporting (*as in a vehicle* or in one\'s hands or arms)\"); Random
House Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 319 (2d ed. 1987)
(*first* definition: \"to take or support from one place to another;
convey; transport\").

The origin of the word \"carries\" explains why the first, or basic,
meaning of the word \"carry\" includes conveyance in a vehicle. See
Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology 146 (1988) (tracing the word from Latin
\"carum,\" which means \"car\" or \"cart\"); 2 Oxford English
Dictionary, *supra,* at 919 (tracing the word from Old French \"carier\"
and the late Latin \"carricare,\" which meant to \"convey in a car\");
Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology 148 (C. Onions ed. 1966) (same);
Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, *supra,* at 143 (explaining that the
term \"car\" has been used to refer to the automobile since 1896).

\[129\] The greatest of writers have used the word with this meaning.
See, *e. g.,* The King James Bible, 2 Kings 9:28 (\"\[H\]is servants
carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem\"); *id.,* Isaiah 30:6 (\"\[T\]hey
will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses\"). Robinson
Crusoe says, \"\[w\]ith my boat, I carry\'d away every Thing.\" D.
Defoe, Robinson Crusoe 174 (J. Crowley ed. 1972). And the owners of
Queequeg\'s ship, Melville writes, \"had lent him a \[wheelbarrow\], in
which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding-house.\" H. Melville,
Moby Dick 43 (U. Chicago 1952). This Court, too, has spoken of the
\"carrying\" of drugs in a car or in its \"trunk.\" *California* v.
*Acevedo,* 500 U. S. 565, 572-573 (1991); *Florida* v. *Jimeno,* 500 U.
S. 248, 249 (1991).

These examples do not speak directly about carrying guns. But there is
nothing linguistically special about the fact that weapons, rather than
drugs, are being carried. Robinson Crusoe might have carried a gun in
his boat; Queequeg might have borrowed a wheelbarrow in which to carry
not a chest but a harpoon. And, to make certain that there is no special
ordinary English restriction (unmentioned in dictionaries) upon the use
of \"carry\" in respect to guns, we have surveyed modern press usage,
albeit crudely, by searching computerized newspaper data bases---both
the New York Times data base in Lexis/Nexis, and the \"US News\" data
base in Westlaw. We looked for sentences in which the words \"carry,\"
\"vehicle,\" and \"weapon\" (or variations thereof) all appear. We found
thousands of such sentences, and random sampling suggests that many,
perhaps more than one-third, are sentences used to convey the meaning at
issue here, *i. e.,* the carrying of guns in a car.

The New York Times, for example, writes about \"an ex-con\" who
\"arrives home driving a stolen car and carrying a load of handguns,\"
Mar. 21, 1992, section 1, p. 18, col. 1, and an \"official peace officer
who carries a shotgun in his boat,\" June 19, 1988, section 12WC, p. 2,
col. 1; cf. The New York \[130\] Times Manual of Style and Usage, a Desk
Book of Guidelines for Writers and Editors, foreword (L. Jordan rev. ed.
1976) (restricting Times journalists and editors to the use of proper
English). The Boston Globe refers to the arrest of a professional
baseball player \"for carrying a semiloaded automatic weapon in his
car.\" Dec. 10, 1994, p. 75, col. 5. The Colorado Springs Gazette
Telegraph speaks of one \"Russell\" who \"carries a gun hidden in his
car.\" May 2,1993, p. B1, col. 2. The Arkansas Gazette refers to a
\"house\" that was \"searched\" in an effort to find \"items that could
be carried in a car, such as . . . guns.\"Mar. 10, 1991, p. A1, col. 2.
The San Diego Union-Tribune asks, \"What, do they carry guns aboard
these boats now?\" Feb. 18, 1992, p.D2, col. 5.

Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word
\"carry\"---a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners
and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English Dictionary\'s
*twenty-sixth* definition of \"carry\" is \"bear, wear, hold up, or
sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.\" 2
Oxford English Dictionary, at 921. Webster\'s defines \"carry\" as \"to
move while supporting,\" not just in a vehicle, but also \"in one\'s
hands or arms.\" Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary, *supra,*
at 343. And Black\'s Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase \"carry
arms or weapons\" as

> \"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in
> a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed
> and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with
> another person.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).

These special definitions, however, do not purport to *limit* the
\"carrying of arms\" to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts
that one who bears arms on his person \"carries a weapon.\" But to say
that is not to deny that one may *also* \"carry a weapon\" tied to the
saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.

\[131\] Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress
intended to limit the word \"carries\" in the statute to any of these
special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions
embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of \"carry,\" a
meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as
when, for example, a column \"carries\" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford
English Dictionary, at 919, 921. In this sense a gangster might
\"carry\" a gun (in colloquial language, he might \"pack a gun\") even
though he does not move from his chair. It is difficult to believe,
however, that Congress intended to limit the statutory word to this
definition---imposing special punishment upon the comatose gangster
while ignoring drug lords who drive to a sale carrying an arsenal of
weapons in their van.

We recognize, as the dissent emphasizes, that the word \"carry\" has
other meanings as well. But those other meanings (*e. g.,* \"carry all
he knew,\" \"carries no colours\"), see *post,* at 143-144, are not
relevant here. And the fact that speakers often do *not* add to the
phrase \"carry a gun\" the words \"in a car\" is of no greater relevance
here than the fact that millions of Americans did *not* see Muscarello
carry a gun in his truck. The relevant linguistic facts are that the
word \"carry\" in its ordinary sense includes carrying in a car and that
the word, used in its ordinary sense, keeps the same meaning whether one
carries a gun, a suitcase, or a banana.

Given the ordinary meaning of the word \"carry,\" it is not surprising
to find that the Federal Courts of Appeals have unanimously concluded
that \"carry\" is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the
person but can include their carriage in a car. *\[Citing numerous
cases.\]*

## B

We now explore more deeply the purely legal question of whether Congress
intended to use the word \"carry\" in its ordinary sense, or whether it
intended to limit the scope of the phrase to instances in which a gun is
carried \"on the person.\" We conclude that neither the statute\'s basic
purpose nor its legislative history support circumscribing the scope of
the word \"carry\" by applying an \"on the person\" limitation.

This Court has described the statute\'s basic purpose broadly, as an
effort to combat the \"dangerous combination\" of \"drugs and guns.\"
*Smith* v. *United States,* 508 U. S. 223, 240 (1993). And the
provision\'s chief legislative sponsor has said that the provision seeks
\"to persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave
his gun at home.\" 114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (1968) (Rep. Poff); see *Busic*
v. *United States,* 446 U. S. 398, 405 (1980) (describing Poff\'s
comments as \"crucial material\" in interpreting the purpose of §
924(c)); *Simpson* v. *United States,* 435 U. S. 6, 13-14 (1978)
(concluding that Poff\'s comments are \"clearly probative\" and
\"certainly entitled to weight\"); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 22243-22244
(statutes would apply to \"the man who goes out taking a gun to commit a
crime\") (Rep. Hunt); *id.,* at 22244 (\"Of course, what we are trying
to do by these penalties is to persuade the criminal to leave his gun at
home\") (Rep. Randall); *id.* , at 22236 (\"We are concerned . . . with
having the criminal leave his gun at home\") (Rep. Meskill).

From the perspective of any such purpose (persuading a criminal \"to
leave his gun at home\"), what sense would it \[133\] make for this
statute to penalize one who walks with a gun in a bag to the site of a
drug sale, but to ignore a similar individual who, like defendant
Gray-Santana, travels to a similar site with a similar gun in a similar
bag, but instead of walking, drives there with the gun in his car? How
persuasive is a punishment that is without effect until a drug dealer
who has brought his gun to a sale (indeed has it available for use)
actually takes it from the trunk (or unlocks the glove compartment) of
his car? It is difficult to say that, considered as a class, those who
prepare, say, to sell drugs by placing guns in their cars are less
dangerous, or less deserving of punishment, than those who carry
handguns on their person.

We have found no significant indication elsewhere in the legislative
history of any more narrowly focused relevant purpose. We have found an
instance in which a legislator referred to the statute as applicable
when an individual \"has a firearm on his person,\" *ibid.* (Rep.
Meskill); an instance in which a legislator speaks of \"a criminal who
takes a gun in his hand,\" *id.* , at 22239 (Rep. Pucinski); and a
reference in the Senate Report to a \"gun carried in a pocket,\" S. Rep.
No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1983); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 21788, 21789
(1968) (references to gun \"carrying\" without more). But in these
instances no one purports to define the scope of the term \"carries\";
and the examples of guns carried on the person are not used to
illustrate the reach of the term \"carries\" but to illustrate, or to
criticize, a different aspect of the statute.

Regardless, in other instances, legislators suggest that the word
\"carries\" has a broader scope. One legislator indicates that the
statute responds in part to the concerns of law enforcement personnel,
who had urged that \"carrying short firearms in motor vehicles be
classified as carrying such weapons concealed.\" *Id.,* at 22242 (Rep.
May). Another criticizes a version of the proposed statute by suggesting
it might apply to drunken driving, and gives as an example a \[134\]
drunken driver who has a \"gun in his car.\" *Id.,* at 21792 (Rep.
Yates). Others describe the statute as criminalizing gun
\"possession\"---a term that could stretch beyond both the \"use\" of a
gun and the carrying of a gun on the person. See *id.,* at 21793 (Rep.
Casey); *id.,* at 22236 (Rep. Meskill); *id.,* at 30584 (Rep. Collier);
*id.,* at 30585 (Rep. Skubitz).

## C

We are not convinced by petitioners\' remaining arguments to the
contrary. First, they say that our definition of \"carry\" makes it the
equivalent of \"transport.\" Yet, Congress elsewhere in related statutes
used the word \"transport\" deliberately to signify a different, and
broader, statutory coverage. The immediately preceding statutory
subsection, for example, imposes a different set of penalties on one
who, with an intent to commit a crime, \"ships, transports, or receives
a firearm\" in interstate commerce. 18 U. S. C. § 924(b). Moreover, §
926A specifically \"entitle\[s\]\" a person \"not otherwise prohibited .
. . from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm\" to \"transport
a firearm . . . from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry\"
it to \"any other place\" where he may do so. Why, petitioners ask,
would Congress have used the word \"transport,\" or used both \"carry\"
and \"transport\" in the same provision, if it had intended to
obliterate the distinction between the two?

The short answer is that our definition does not equate \"carry\" and
\"transport.\" \"Carry\" implies personal agency and some degree of
possession, whereas \"transport\" does not have such a limited
connotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods in bulk over
great distances. See Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary, at
343 (noting that \"carry\" means \"moving to a location some distance
away while supporting or maintaining off the ground\" and \"is a natural
word to use in ref. to cargoes and loads on trucks, wagons, planes,
ships, or even beasts of burden,\" while \"transport refers to carriage
in bulk or number over an appreciable \[135\] distance and, typically,
by a customary or usual carrier agency\"); see also Webster\'s
Dictionary of Synonyms 141 (1942). If Smith, for example, calls a parcel
delivery service, which sends a truck to Smith\'s house to pick up
Smith\'s package and take it to Los Angeles, one might say that Smith
has shipped the package and the parcel delivery service has transported
the package. But only the truck driver has \"carried\" the package in
the sense of \"carry\" that we believe Congress intended. Therefore,
\"transport\" is a broader category that includes \"carry\" but also
encompasses other activity.

The dissent refers to § 926A and to another statute where Congress used
the word \"transport\" rather than \"carry\" to describe the movement of
firearms. 18 U. S. C. § 925(a) (2)(B); *post,* at 146-147. According to
the dissent, had Congress intended \"carry\" to have the meaning we give
it, Congress would not have needed to use a different word in these
provisions. But as we have discussed above, we believe the word
\"transport\" is broader than the word \"carry.\"

And, if Congress intended \"carry\" to have the limited definition the
dissent contends, it would have been quite unnecessary to add the
proviso in § 926A requiring a person, to be exempt from penalties, to
store her firearm in a locked container not immediately accessible. See
§ 926A (quoted in full, *post,* at 146) (exempting from criminal
penalties one who transports a firearm from a place where \"he may
lawfully possess and carry such firearm\" but not exempting the
\"transportation\" of a firearm if it is \"readily accessible or is
directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting
vehicle\"). The statute simply could have said that such a person may
not \"carry\" a firearm. But, of course, Congress did not say this
because that is not what \"carry\" means.

As we interpret the statutory scheme, it makes sense. Congress has
imposed a variable penalty with no mandatory minimum sentence upon a
person who \"transports\" (or \[136\] \"ships\" or \"receives\") a
firearm knowing it will be used to commit any \"offense punishable by
imprisonment for \[more than\] one year,\" § 924(b), and it has imposed
a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence upon one who \"carries\" a firearm
\"during and in relation to\" a \"drug trafficking crime,\" § 924(c).
The first subsection imposes a less strict sentencing regime upon one
who, say, ships firearms by mail for use in a crime elsewhere; the
latter subsection imposes a mandatory sentence upon one who, say, brings
a weapon with him (on his person or in his car) to the site of a drug
sale.

Second, petitioners point out that, in *Bailey* v. *United States,* 516
U. S. 137 (1995), we considered the related phrase \"uses . . . a
firearm\" found in the same statutory provision now before us. See 18 U.
S. C. § 924(c)(1) (\"uses or carries a firearm\"). We construed the term
\"use\" narrowly, limiting its application to the \"active employment\"
of a firearm. *Bailey,* 516 U. S., at 144. Petitioners argue that it
would be anomalous to construe broadly the word \"carries,\" its
statutory next-door neighbor.

In *Bailey,* however, we limited \"use\" of a firearm to \"active
employment\" in part because we assumed \"that Congress. . . intended
each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\" *Id.* , at
146. A broader interpretation of \"use,\" we said, would have swallowed
up the term \"carry.\" *Ibid.* But \"carry\" as we interpret that word
does not swallow up the term \"use.\" \"Use\" retains the same
independent meaning we found for it in *Bailey,* where we provided
examples involving the displaying or the bartering of a gun. *Ibid.*
\"Carry\" also retains an independent meaning, for, under *Bailey,*
carrying a gun in a car does not necessarily involve the gun\'s \"active
employment.\" More importantly, having construed \"use\" narrowly in
*Bailey,* we cannot also construe \"carry\" narrowly without
undercutting the statute\'s basic objective. For the narrow
interpretation would remove the act of carrying a gun in a car entirely
from the statute\'s \[137\] reach, leaving a gap in coverage that we do
not believe Congress intended.

Third, petitioners say that our reading of the statute would extend its
coverage to passengers on buses, trains, or ships, who have placed a
firearm, say, in checked luggage. To extend this statute so far, they
argue, is unfair, going well beyond what Congress likely would have
thought possible. They add that some lower courts, thinking
approximately the same, have limited the scope of \"carries\" to
instances where a gun in a car is immediately accessible, thereby most
likely excluding from coverage a gun carried in a car\'s trunk or locked
glove compartment. See, *e. g.* , *Foster,* 133 F. 3d, at 708
(concluding that person \"carries\" a firearm in a car only if the
firearm is immediately accessible); *Giraldo,* 80 F. 3d, at 676 (same).

In our view, this argument does not take adequate account of other
limiting words in the statute---words that make the statute applicable
only where a defendant \"carries\" a gun *both* \"during *and* in
relation to\" a drug crime. § 924(c)(1) (emphasis added). Congress added
these words in part to prevent prosecution where guns \"played\" no part
in the crime. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 314, n. 10; cf. *United States*
v. *Stewart,* 779 F. 2d 538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (observing
that \"\`in relation to\' \" was \"added to allay explicitly the concern
that a person could be prosecuted . . . for committing an entirely
unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm\"), overruled in part
on other grounds, *United States* v. *Hernandez,* 80 F. 3d 1253, 1257
(CA9 1996).

Once one takes account of the words \"during\" and \"in relation to,\"
it no longer seems beyond Congress\' likely intent, or otherwise unfair,
to interpret the statute as we have done. If one carries a gun in a car
\"during\" and \"in relation to\" a drug sale, for example, the fact
that the gun is carried in the car\'s trunk or locked glove compartment
seems not only logically difficult to distinguish from the immediately
accessible gun, but also beside the point.

\[138\] At the same time, the narrow interpretation creates its own
anomalies. The statute, for example, defines \"firearm\" to include a
\"bomb,\" \"grenade,\" \"rocket having a propellant charge of more than
four ounces,\" or \"missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of
more than one-quarter ounce,\" where such device is \"explosive,\"
\"incendiary,\" or delivers \"poison gas.\" 18 U. S. C. § 921(a)(4)(A).
On petitioners\' reading, the \"carry\" provision would not apply to
instances where drug lords, engaged in a major transaction, took with
them \"firearms\" such as these, which most likely could not be carried
on the person.

Fourth, petitioners argue that we should construe the word \"carry\" to
mean \"immediately accessible.\" And, as we have said, they point out
that several Courts of Appeals have limited the statute\'s scope in this
way. See, *e. g.* , *Foster, supra,* at 708; *Giraldo, supra,* at 676.
That interpretation, however, is difficult to square with the statute\'s
language, for one \"carries\" a gun in the glove compartment whether or
not that glove compartment is locked. Nothing in the statute\'s history
suggests that Congress intended that limitation. And, for reasons
pointed out above, see *supra,* at 137, we believe that the words
\"during\" and \"in relation to\" will limit the statute\'s application
to the harms that Congress foresaw.

Finally, petitioners and the dissent invoke the \"rule of lenity.\" The
simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, however, is not sufficient
to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to
some degree. Cf. *Smith,* 508 U. S., at 239 (\"The mere possibility of
articulating a narrower construction . . . does not by itself make the
rule of lenity applicable\"). \"\`The rule of lenity applies only if,
\"after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,\" . . . we can
make \"no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"\` \" *United
States* v. *Wells,* 519 U. S. 482, 499 (1997) (quoting *Reno* v.
*Koray,* 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995), in turn quoting *Smith, supra,* at
239, and *Ladner* v. *United States,* 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). To
invoke the rule, we must conclude \[139\] that there is a \"\`
\"grievous ambiguity or uncertainty\"\` in the statute.\" *Staples* v.
*United States,* 511 U. S. 600, 619, n. 17 (1994) (quoting *Chapman* v.
*United States,* 500 U. S. 453, 463 (1991)). Certainly, our decision
today is based on much more than a \"guess as to what Congress
intended,\" and there is no \"grievous ambiguity\" here. The problem of
statutory interpretation in these cases is indeed no different from that
in many of the criminal cases that confront us. Yet, this Court has
never held that the rule of lenity automatically permits a defendant to
win.

In sum, the \"generally accepted contemporary meaning\" of the word
\"carry\" includes the carrying of a firearm in a vehicle. The purpose
of this statute warrants its application in such circumstances. The
limiting phrase \"during and in relation to\" should prevent misuse of
the statute to penalize those whose conduct does not create the risks of
harm at which the statute aims.

For these reasons, we conclude that petitioners\' conduct falls within
the scope of the phrase \"carries a firearm.\" The judgments of the
Courts of Appeals are affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

## Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Section 924(c)(1) of Title 18, United States Code, is a
punishment-enhancing provision; it imposes a mandatory five-year prison
term when the defendant \"during and in relation to any crime of
violence or drug trafficking .. . uses or carries a firearm.\" In
*Bailey* v. *United States,* 516 U. S. 137 (1995), this Court held that
the term \"uses,\" in the context of § 924(c)(1), means \"active
employment\" of the firearm. In today\'s cases we confront a related
question: What does the term \"carries\" mean in the context of §
924(c)(1), the enhanced punishment prescription again at issue.

It is uncontested that § 924(c)(1) applies when the defendant bears a
firearm, *i. e.,* carries the weapon on or about his \[140\] person
\"for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive
action in case of a conflict.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed.
1990) (defining the phrase \"carry arms or weapons\"); see *ante,* at
130. The Court holds that, in addition, \"carries a firearm,\" in the
context of § 924(c)(1), means personally transporting, possessing, or
keeping a firearm in a vehicle, anyplace in a vehicle.

Without doubt, \"carries\" is a word of many meanings, definable to mean
or include carting about in a vehicle. But that encompassing definition
is not a ubiquitously necessary one. Nor, in my judgment, is it a proper
construction of \"carries\" as the term appears in § 924(c)(1). In line
with *Bailey* and the principle of lenity the Court has long followed, I
would confine \"carries a firearm,\" for § 924(c)(1) purposes, to the
undoubted meaning of that expression in the relevant context. I would
read the words to indicate not merely keeping arms on one\'s premises or
in one\'s vehicle, but bearing them in such manner as to be ready for
use as a weapon.

Unlike the Court, I do not think

surveys of press
reports,[^\[5\]^](#X8f543c0f8ecbf45c3f91bca4b907266cd92bafe) or the

dispositively, what \"carries\" \[143\] means embedded in § 924(c)(1).
On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean, *inter
alia,* transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be
infectious, or wear or bear on one\'s
person.[^\[7\]^](#X59ffb76aea04d353d2bff6550daaa3ec5c9baf6) At issue
here is not \"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court\'s
computer search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns
in a car showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one-third\" of the
time. *Ante,* at 129. One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some
two-thirds of the time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the
Constitution\'s Second Amendment (\"keep and *bear* Arms\") (emphasis
added) and Black\'s Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or
carry . . .upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the
purpose .. . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action
in a case of conflict with another person.\"

On lessons from literature, a scan of Bartlett\'s and other quotation
collections shows how highly selective the Court\'s choices are. See
*ante,* at 129. If \"\[t\]he greatest of writers\" have used \"carry\"
to mean convey or transport in a vehicle, so have they used the
hydra-headed word to mean, *inter alia,* carry in one\'s hand, arms,
head, heart, or soul, sans vehicle. Consider, among countless examples:

> \"\[H\]e shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
> bosom.\" The King James Bible, Isaiah 40:11.
>
> \"And still they gaz\'d, and still the wonder grew,
>
> \[144\] That one small head could carry all he knew.\" O. Goldsmith,
> The Deserted Village, ll. 215-216, in The Poetical Works of Oliver
> Goldsmith 30 (A. Dobson ed. 1949).
>
> \"There\'s a Legion that never was \`listed, That carries no colours
> or crest.\" R. Kipling, The Lost Legion, st. 1, in Rudyard Kipling\'s
> Verse, 1885-1918, p. 222 (1920).

> \"There is a homely adage which runs, \`Speak softly and carry a big

> Kaplan ed. 1992).[^\[8\]^](#Xb80ceb6f82f72c08c6d1565992b4740ff7863db)

These and the Court\'s lexicological sources demonstrate vividly that
\"carry\" is a word commonly used to convey various messages. Such
references, given their variety, are not reliable indicators of what
Congress meant, in § 924(c)(1), by \"carries a firearm.\"

## C

Noting the paradoxical statement, \"\`I *use* a gun to protect my house,
but I\'ve never had to *use* it,\' \" the Court in *Bailey,* 516 U. S.,
at 143, emphasized the importance of context--- the statutory context.
Just as \"uses\" was read to mean not simply \"possession,\" but
\"active employment,\" so \"carries,\" correspondingly, is properly read
to signal the most dangerous \[145\] cases---the gun at hand, ready for
use as a weapon.[^\[9\]^](#X5898b8de9423160eadcca4f8e2c2390a4f8c963) It
is reasonable to comprehend Congress as having provided mandatory
minimums for the most life-jeopardizing gunconnection cases (guns in or
at the defendant\'s hand when committing an offense), leaving other,
less imminently threatening, situations for the more flexible Guidelines
regime.[^\[10\]^](#X03c0b6fe347f9c9948f336b7fc527877444cf70) As the
Ninth Circuit suggested, it is not apparent why possession of a gun in a
drug dealer\'s moving vehicle would be thought more dangerous than gun
possession on premises where drugs are sold: \"A drug dealer who packs
heat is more likely to hurt someone or provoke someone else to violence.
A gun in a bag under a tarp in a truck bed \[or in a bedroom closet\]
poses substantially less risk.\" *United States* v. *Foster,* 133 F. 3d
704, 707 (1998) (en
banc).[^\[11\]^](#X971c08ab06dbdeac536282a8c14d658e9e65424)

For indicators from Congress itself, it is appropriate to consider word
usage in other provisions of Title 18\'s chapter on \"Firearms.\" See
*Bailey,* 516 U. S., at 143, 146 (interpreting § 924(c)(1) in light of
18 U. S. C. §§ 922(g), 922(j), 922(k), 922(*o* )(1), 924(d)(1), 930(a),
930(b)). The Court, however, \[146\] does not derive from the statutory
complex at issue its thesis that \"\`\[c\]arry\' implies personal agency
and some degree of possession, whereas \`transport\' does not have such
a limited connotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods in
bulk over great distances.\" *Ante,* at 134. Looking to provisions
Congress enacted, one finds that the Legislature did not acknowledge or
routinely adhere to the distinction the Court advances today; instead,
Congress sometimes employed \"transports\" when, according to the Court,
\"carries\" was the right word to use.

Section 925(a)(2)(B), for example, provides that no criminal sanction
shall attend \"the transportation of \[a\] firearm or ammunition carried
out to enable a person, who lawfully received such firearm or ammunition
from the Secretary of the Army, to engage in military training or in
competitions.\" The full text of § 926A, rather than the truncated
version the Court presents, see *ibid.,* is also telling:

> \"Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or
> regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person
> who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting,
> shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a
> firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully

In describing when and how a person may travel in a vehicle that
contains his firearm without violating the law, \[147\] §§ 925(a)(2)(B)
and 926A use \"transport,\" not \"carry,\" to \"impl\[y\] personal
agency and some degree of possession.\"
*Ibid.*[^\[12\]^](#X7d34e69fd3bc326bfca986b9a0c79065b501341)

Reading \"carries\" in § 924(c)(1) to mean \"on or about \[one\'s\]
person\" is fully compatible with these and other \"Firearms\"
statutes.[^\[13\]^](#X99f8de2fe4a200155a394385a4e2d2cdee40e18) For
example, under § 925(a)(2)(B), one could carry his gun to a car,
transport it to the shooting competition, and use it to shoot targets.
Under the conditions of § 926A, one could transport her gun in a car,
but under no circumstances could the gun be readily accessible while she
travels in the car. \"\[C\]ourts normally try to read language in
different, but related, statutes, so as best to reconcile \[148\] those
statutes, in light of their purposes and of common sense.\" *McFadden,*
13 F. 3d, at 467 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting). So reading the
\"Firearms\" statutes, I would not extend the word \"carries\" in §
924(c)(1) to mean transports out of hand\'s reach in a
vehicle.[^\[14\]^](#Xfa0b7daba71eefc6e6784b7c14e98b640507c0b)

## II

Section 924(c)(1), as the foregoing discussion details, is not
decisively clear one way or another. The sharp division in the Court on
the proper reading of the measure confirms, \"\[a\]t the very least, . .
. that the issue is subject to some doubt. Under these circumstances, we
adhere to the familiar rule that, \`where there is ambiguity in a
criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\' \"
*Adamo Wrecking Co.* v. *United States,* 434 U. S. 275, 284-285 (1978)
(citation omitted); see *United States* v. *Granderson,* 511 U. S. 39,
54 (1994) (\"\[W\]here text, structure, and history fail to establish
that the Government\'s position is unambiguously correct---we apply the
rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in \[the defendant\'s\]
favor.\"). \"Carry\" bears many meanings, \[149\] as the Court and the
\"Firearms\" statutes
demonstrate.[^\[15\]^](#Xe1a0b91c6be3487500f7b00539e8540e5bbb776) The
narrower \"on or about \[one\'s\] person\" interpretation is hardly
implausible nor at odds with an accepted meaning of \"carries a
firearm.\"

Overlooking that there will be an enhanced sentence for the
gun-possessing drug dealer in any event, see *supra,* at 140-142, the
Court asks rhetorically: \"How persuasive is a punishment that is
without effect until a drug dealer who has brought his gun to a sale
(indeed has it available for use) actually takes it from the trunk (or
unlocks the glove compartment) of his car?\" *Ante,* at 133.
Correspondingly, the Court defines \"carries a firearm\" to cover \"a
person who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms \[anyplace\] in a
vehicle . . . which the person accompanies.\" *Ante,* at 126-127.
Congress, however, hardly lacks competence to select the words
\"possesses\" or \"conveys\" when that is what the Legislature
means.[^\[16\]^](#X983f404785664849e7a72c22f08a1b1805662dd) Notably in
view of the Legislature\'s capacity to speak plainly, and of overriding
concern, the Court\'s inquiry \[150\] pays scant attention to a core
reason for the rule of lenity: \"\[B\]ecause of the seriousness of
criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents
the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts
should define criminal activity. This policy embodies \`the instinctive
distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has
clearly said they should.\' \" *United States* v. *Bass,* 404 U. S. 336,
348 (1971) (quoting H. Friendly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading
of Statutes, in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967)).

Actus Reus

 

Actus reus, or the act requirement, is the first part of culpability in
criminal law. (You will meet the second part, mens rea, in the next
section.) In short, almost every crime must have an act, but defining
that act can be tricky. Sometimes something that seems like an act isn't
an act; other times, something that does not seem like an act is one.
These cases introduce you to the act requirement. Notice distinctions
between voluntary and involuntary acts, and between conduct and the
results of conduct. Consider why the court reaches the decision it does
in each case, and what its decision says about its concept of
blameworthiness.

Appellant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway, and appeals.
Officers of the law arrested him at his home and took him onto the
highway, where he allegedly committed the proscribed acts, viz.,
manifested a drunken condition by using loud and profane language.

The pertinent provisions of our statute are: "Any person who, while
intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more
persons are present, \* \* \* and manifests a drunken condition by
boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on
conviction, be fined", etc. Code 1940, Title 14, Section 120.

Under the plain terms of this statute, a voluntary appearance is
presupposed. The rule has been declared, and we think it sound, that an
accusation of drunkenness in a designated public place cannot be
established by proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated
condition, was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the
arresting officer.

Conviction of appellant was contrary to this announced principle and, in

Notes and Questions (Martin v State)

 

By Nicholas Newman and Miriam Contreras

Notes and Questions

1.  Using Martin, decide the following scenario: Jacob lives in Canada
    near the U.S.-Canadian border. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), U.S.
    federal law does not allow "at any time \[those without the correct
    immigration documents to be\] found in, the United States." Jacob is
    kidnapped and forcibly brought into the United States. Is he guilty?
    Is he guilty if he was given sedatives before being kidnapped?

2.  Punishing Thoughts? The phrase "I'm going to kill you" has become
    somewhat of a colloquial expression of anger. In Twelve Angry Men
    the main character lists different scenarios in which people use
    this phrase, but don't actually mean it. Take it a step back. What
    if, on your morning commute, someone cuts you off and you think in
    your head a variation of the above phrase. Can the law punish you
    for this thought? The answer is criminal law only punishes acts. 

3.  Involuntary vs Voluntary Acts. Consider the following statements:

\(a\) David stretched his leg.

\(b\) David's leg extended.

 

While these two statements seem to describe the same situation, sentence
(b) could be an involuntary act. What if his little brother pulled
David\'s leg, or a doctor hit his kneecap, causing a reflexive reaction?
Criminal law only punishes voluntary acts.

State v. Utter

 

4 Wn. App. 137 (1971)

479 P.2d 946

THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, Respondent,

v\.

CLAUDE GILBERT UTTER, Appellant.

No. 611-41091-1.

The Court of Appeals of Washington, Division One --- Panel 1.

January 25, 1971.

Hohlbein, Vanderhoef, Sawyer &amp; Hartman and Wesley G. Hohlbein, for
appellant

(appointed counsel for appeal).

Christopher T. Bayley, Prosecuting Attorney, and Paul M. Acheson,
Deputy, for respondent.

FARRIS, A.C.J.

Claude Gilbert Utter was charged by an information filed January 16,
1969, with the crime of

murder in the second degree. He was convicted by a jury of the crime of
manslaughter. He

appeals from that conviction.

Appellant and the decedent, his son, were living together at the time of
the latter's death.

The son was seen to enter his father's apartment and shortly after was
heard to say, "Dad,

don't"; Shortly thereafter he was seen stumbling in the hallway of the
apartment building

where he collapsed, having been stabbed in the chest. He stated, "Dad
stabbed me"; and

died before he could be moved or questioned further.

Mr. Utter entered the armed services in December of 1942 and was
honorably discharged

in October of 1946. He was a combat infantryman. As a result of his
service, he was

awarded a 60 per cent disability pension.

Appellant testified that on the date of his son's death he began
drinking during the morning

hours. He was at the liquor store at 9 a.m. and purchased a quart of
Thunderbird wine and

a quart of port wine and drank the bottle of port wine with the
exception of two drinks. Mr.

Utter went for more liquor around noon. At that time he purchased 2
quarts of whiskey and

4 quarts of wine. Upon his return from the liquor store, he and another
resident of the

apartment "sat around drinking whiskey out of water glasses."; Appellant
remembers

drinking with his friend and the next thing he remembers was being in
jail subsequent to the

death of his son. He has no recollection of any intervening events.

Appellant introduced evidence on "conditioned response"; during the
trial. Conditioned

response was defined by Dr. Jarvis, a psychiatrist, as "an act or a
pattern of activity

occurring so rapidly, so uniformly as to be automatic in response to a
certain stimulus."; Mr.

Utter testified that as a result of his jungle warfare training and
experiences in World War II,

he had on two occasions in the 1950's reacted violently towards people
approaching him

unexpectedly from the rear.

The trial court ruled that conditioned response was not a defense in
Washington and

instructed the jury to disregard all evidence introduced on this
subject. \....

The major issue presented on appeal is whether it was error for the
trial court to instruct the

jury to disregard the evidence on conditioned response. \....

There are two components of every crime. One is objective --- the actus
reus; the other

subjective --- the mens rea. The actus reus is the culpable act itself,
the mens rea is the

criminal intent with which one performs the criminal act. However, the
mens rea does not

encompass the entire mental process of one accused of a crime. There is
a certain minimal

mental element required in order to establish the actus reus itself.
This is the element of

volition. See Sim, The Involuntary Actus Reus, 25 Modern L. Rev. 741
(1962).

In the present case, the appellant was charged with second-degree murder
and found guilty

of manslaughter. The actus reus of both is the same --- homicide. Thus,
in order to establish

either, the fact of homicide must first be established.

Appellant contends that his evidence was presented for the purpose of
determining whether

in fact a homicide had been committed. He argues that his evidence, if
believed, establishes

that no "act" was committed within the definition of homicide, RCW
9.48.010 (since

amended by Laws of 1970, Ex. Ses., ch. 49, § 1, p. 333):

Homicide is the killing of a human being by the act, procurement or
omission of another and

is either (1) murder, (2) manslaughter, (3) excusable homicide or (4)
justifiable homicide.

What is the meaning of the word "act" as used in this statute?

It is sometimes said that no crime has been committed unless the harmful
result was

brought about by a \"voluntary act.\" Analysis of such a statement will
disclose, however, that as so used the phrase \"voluntary act\" means no
more than the mere word \"act.\" An act

must be a willed movement or the omission of a possible and
legally-required performance.

This is essential to the actus reus rather than to the mens rea. \"A
spasm is not an act.\" R.

Perkins, Criminal Law 660 (1957).

\[A\]n \`act' involves an exercise of the will. It signifies something
done voluntarily. It

necessarily implies intention. We find these statements abundantly
sustained by the text-

writers and decisions of our courts. Heiman v. Pan American Life Ins.
Co., 183 La. 1045,

1061, 165 So. 195 (1935). See also Stokes v. Carlson, 362 Mo. 93, 240
S.W.2d 132

(1951); Brown v. Standard Casket Mfg. Co., 234 Ala. 512, 175 So. 358
(1937); Duncan v.

Landis, 106 F. 839 (3d Cir.1901).

Thus, to invert the statement of Perkins, the word \"act\" technically
means a \"voluntary

act.\" See State v. Peterson, 73 Wn.2d 303, 438 P.2d 183 (1968).

It is the appellant's contention that any of the alleged \"acts\" he
committed were not those which involved mental processes, but rather
were learned physical reactions to external stimuli which operated
automatically on his autonomic nervous system.... Appellant

contends that a person in an automatistic or unconscious state is
incapable of committing a

culpable act --- in this case, a homicidal act....

There is authority to support the proposition of the appellant.

Where, at the time of the killing, the slayer was clearly unconscious
thereof, such

unconsciousness will constitute a defense, as in the case of a homicide
committed by one

in a state of somnambulism, or while delirious from disease. (Footnotes
omitted.) O. Warren

and B. Bilas, 1 Warren on Homicide § 61 (perm. ed. 1938).

If a person is in fact unconscious at the time he commits an act which
would otherwise be

criminal, he is not responsible therefore. The absence of consciousness
not only precludes

the existence of any specific mental state, but also excludes the
possibility of a voluntary act

without which there can be no criminal liability. (Footnotes omitted.)
...

An \"act\" committed while one is unconscious is in reality no act at
all. It is merely a physical

event or occurrence for which there can be no criminal liability.
However, unconsciousness

does not, in all cases, provide a defense to a crime. When the state of
unconsciousness is

voluntarily induced through the use and consumption of alcohol or drugs,
then that state of

unconsciousness does not attain the stature of a complete defense. Thus,
in a case such as

the present one where there is evidence that the accused has consumed
alcohol or drugs,

the trial court should give a cautionary instruction with respect to
voluntarily induced

unconsciousness.

The issue of whether or not the appellant was in an unconscious or
automatistic state at the

time he allegedly committed the criminal acts charged is a question of
fact. Appellant\'s

theory of the case should have been presented to the jury if there was
substantial evidence

in the record to support it.

... It is the function and province of the jury to weigh evidence and
determine credibility of

witnesses and decide disputed questions of fact. State v. Dietrich, 75
Wn.2d 676, 453 P.2d

654 (1969). However, a court should not submit to the jury an issue of
fact unless there is

substantial evidence in the record to support it. State v. Brooks, 73
Wn.2d 653, 440 P.2d

199 (1968); State v. Collins, 66 Wn.2d 71, 400 P.2d 793 (1965).

We find that the evidence presented was insufficient to present the
issue of defendant\'s

unconscious or automatistic state at the time of the act to the jury.
There is no evidence,

circumstantial or otherwise from which the jury could determine or
reasonably infer what

happened in the room at the time of the stabbing; the jury could only
speculate on the

existence of the triggering stimulus.

Affirmed.

*State v. Strasburg, supra* at 113.

An "act" committed while one is unconscious is in reality no act at all.
It is merely a physical event or occurrence for which there can be no
criminal liability. However, unconsciousness does not, in all cases,
provide a defense to a crime. When the state of unconsciousness is
voluntarily induced through the use and consumption of alcohol or drugs,
then that state of unconsciousness does not attain the stature of a
complete defense. Thus, in a case such as the present one where there is
evidence that the accused has consumed alcohol or drugs, the trial court
should give a cautionary instruction with respect to voluntarily induced
unconsciousness.

The issue of whether or not the appellant was in an unconscious or
automatistic state at the time he allegedly committed the criminal acts
charged is a question of fact. Appellant's theory of the case should
have been presented to the jury if there was substantial evidence in the
record to support it.

It is the function and province of the jury to weigh evidence and
determine credibility of witnesses and decide disputed questions of
fact. *State v. Dietrich, 75* Wn.2d 676, 453 P.2d 654 (1969). However, a
court should not submit to the jury an issue of fact unless there is
substantial evidence in the record to support it. *State v. Brooks,* 73
Wn.2d 653, 440 P.2d 199 (1968); *State v. Collins,* 66 Wn.2d 71, 400
P.2d 793 (1965).

We find that the evidence presented was insufficient to present the
issue of defendant's unconscious or automatistic state at the time of
the act to the jury. There is no evidence, circumstantial or otherwise
from which the jury could determine or reasonably infer what happened in
the room at the time of the stabbing; the jury could only speculate on
the existence of the triggering stimulus.

New York Court of Appeals

2 N.Y.2d 133

1956-11-29

2 N.Y.2d 133 (1956)

### The People of the State of New York, Appellant-Respondent, v. Emil Decina, Respondent-Appellant.

Court of Appeals of the State of New York.

Argued October 4, 1956.

Decided November 29, 1956.

**\[ ... \]**

FROESSEL, J.

At about 3:30 P.M. on March 14, 1955, a bright, sunny day, defendant was
driving, alone in his car, in a northerly direction on Delaware Avenue
in the city of Buffalo. **\[ ... \]**At a point south of an overhead
viaduct of the Erie Railroad, defendant\'s car swerved to the left,
across the center line in the street, so that it was completely in the
south lane, traveling 35 to 40 miles per hour.

It then veered sharply to the right, crossing Delaware Avenue and
mounting the easterly curb at a point beneath the viaduct and continued
thereafter at a speed estimated to have been about 50 or 60 miles per
hour or more. **\[ ... \]**

A group of six schoolgirls were walking north on the easterly sidewalk
of Delaware Avenue, two in front and four slightly in the rear, when
defendant\'s car struck them from behind. One of the girls escaped
injury by jumping against the wall of the viaduct. **\[ ... \]** Three
of the children, 6 to 12 years old, were found dead on arrival by the
medical examiner, and a fourth child, 7 years old, died in a hospital
two days later as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.

After striking the children, defendant\'s car continued on the easterly
sidewalk, and then swerved back onto Delaware Avenue once more. It
continued in a northerly direction**\[ ... \]**until it finally crashed
through a 7¼-inch brick wall of a grocery store, injuring at least one
customer and causing considerable property damage.

**\[ ... \]**Defendant was stooped over in the car and was \"bobbing a
little\". To one witness he appeared dazed, to another unconscious,
lying back with his hands off the wheel. Various people present shouted
to defendant to turn off the ignition of his car, and \"within a matter
of seconds the horn stopped blowing and the car did shut off\".

Defendant was pulled out of the car **\[ ... \]** and laid down on the
sidewalk. To a policeman who came on the scene shortly he appeared
\"injured, dazed\"; another witness said that \"he looked as though he
was knocked out, and his arm seemed to be bleeding\". An injured
customer in the store, after receiving first aid, pressed defendant for
an explanation of the accident and he told her: \"I blacked out from the
bridge\".

**\[ ... \]**

*\[At the hospital, Decina\...\]*, who still felt a little dizzy or
blurry, said that as he was driving he noticed a jerking of his right
hand, which warned him that he might develop a convulsion, and that as
he tried to steer the car over to the curb he felt himself becoming
unconscious, and he thought he had a convulsion. He was aware that
children were in front of his car, but did not know whether he had
struck them.

Defendant then proceeded to relate to Dr. Wechter his past medical
history,**\[ ... \]**In 1946 he was treated in this same hospital for an
illness during which he had some convulsions. Several burr holes were
made in his skull and a brain abscess was drained. Following this
operation defendant had no convulsions from 1946 through 1950. In 1950
he had four convulsions, caused by scar tissue on the brain. From 1950
to 1954 he experienced about 10 or 20 seizures a year, in which his
right hand would jump although he remained fully conscious. In 1954, he
had 4 or 5 generalized seizures with loss of consciousness, the last
being in September, 1954, a few months before the accident. Thereafter
he had more hospitalization, a spinal tap, consultation with a
neurologist, and took medication daily to help prevent seizures.

On the basis of this medical history, Dr. Wechter made a diagnosis of
Jacksonian epilepsy, and was of the opinion that defendant had a seizure
at the time of the accident. **\[ ... \]**

Defendant was indicted and charged with violating section 1053-a of the
Penal Law. *\[See concurrence, below, for the relevant text of the
statute.\]*

We turn first to the subject of defendant\'s cross appeal, namely, that
**\[ ... \]**the *indictment* here does not charge a crime. The
indictment states essentially that defendant, *knowing* \"that he was
subject to epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to
lose consciousness for a considerable period of time\", was culpably
negligent \"in that he *consciously* undertook to and *did operate* his
Buick sedan on a public highway\" (emphasis supplied) and \"while so
doing\" suffered such an attack which caused said automobile \"to travel
at a fast and reckless rate of speed, jumping the curb and driving over
the sidewalk\" causing the death of 4 persons. In our opinion, this
clearly states a violation of section 1053-a of the Penal Law. The
statute does not require that a defendant must deliberately intend to
kill a human being, for that would be murder. Nor does the statute
require that he knowingly and consciously follow the precise path that
leads to death and destruction. It is sufficient, we have said, when his
conduct manifests a \"disregard of the consequences which may ensue from
the act, and indifference to the rights of others. No clearer
definition, applicable to the hundreds of varying circumstances that may
arise, can be given. Under a given state of facts, whether negligence is
culpable is a question of judgment.\" (*People v. Angelo*, 246 N.Y. 451,
457.)

Assuming the truth of the indictment, as we must on a demurrer, this
defendant knew he was subject to epileptic \[140\] attacks and seizures
that might strike *at any time*. He also knew that a moving motor
vehicle uncontrolled on a public highway is a highly dangerous
instrumentality capable of unrestrained destruction. With this
*knowledge*, and without anyone accompanying him, he deliberately took a
chance by making a conscious choice of a course of action, in disregard
of the consequences which he knew might follow from his conscious act,
and which in this case did ensue. How can we say as a matter of law that
this did not amount to culpable negligence within the meaning of section
1053-a?

To hold otherwise would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself
in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if
it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and
reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or
involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution under
the statute. His awareness of a condition which he knows may produce
such consequences as here, and his disregard of the consequences,
renders him liable for culpable negligence, as the courts below have
properly held (*People v. Eckert*, 2 N Y 2d 126, decided herewith;
*People v. Kreis*, 302 N.Y. 894; *Matter of* *Enos v. Macduff*, 282 App.
Div. 116; *State v. Gooze*, 14 N. J. Super. 277). To have a sudden
sleeping spell, an unexpected heart or other disabling attack, without
any prior knowledge or warning thereof, is an altogether different
situation (see *Matter of* *Jenson v. Fletcher*, 277 App. Div. 454,
affd. 303 N.Y. 639), and there is simply no basis for comparing such
cases with the flagrant disregard manifested here.

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

\[146\] DESMOND, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

I agree that the judgment of conviction cannot stand but I think the
indictment should be dismissed because it alleges no crime. Defendant\'s
demurrer should have been sustained.

The indictment charges that defendant knowing that \"he was subject to
epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to lose
consciousness\" suffered \"an attack and loss of consciousness which
caused the said automobile operated by the said defendant to travel at a
fast and reckless rate of speed\" and to jump a curb and run onto the
sidewalk \"thereby striking and causing the death\" of 4 children.
Horrible as this occurrence was and whatever necessity it may show for
new licensing and driving laws, nevertheless this indictment charges no
crime known to the New York statutes. Our duty is to dismiss it.

Section 1053-a of the Penal Law describes the crime of \"criminal
negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death\". Declared
to be guilty of that crime is \"A person who operates or drives any
vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby
a human being is killed\". The essentials of the crime are, therefore,
first, vehicle *operation* in a culpably negligent *manner*, and,
second, the resulting death of a person. This indictment asserts that
defendant violated section 1053-a, but it then proceeds in the language
quoted in the next-above paragraph of this opinion to describe the way
in which defendant is supposed to have offended against that statute.
That descriptive matter (an inseparable and controlling ingredient of
the indictment, Code Crim. Pro., §§ 275, 276; *People v. Dumar*, 106
N.Y. 502) shows that defendant did *not* violate section 1053-a. No
*operation* of an automobile in a reckless manner is charged against
defendant. The excessive speed of the car and its jumping the curb were
\"caused\", says the indictment itself, by defendant\'s prior \"attack
and loss of consciousness\". Therefore, what defendant is accused of is
*not* reckless or culpably negligent driving, which necessarily connotes
and involves consciousness and volition. The fatal assault by this car
was after and because of defendant\'s failure of consciousness. To say
that one drove a car in a reckless manner in that his unconscious
condition caused the car to travel recklessly is to make two mutually
contradictory assertions. One cannot be \"reckless\" while unconscious.
One cannot while unconscious \[147\] \"operate\" a car in a culpably
negligent manner or in any other \"manner\". The statute makes criminal
a particular kind of knowing, voluntary, immediate operation. It does
not touch at all the involuntary presence of an unconscious person at
the wheel of an uncontrolled vehicle. To negative the possibility of
applying section 1053-a to these alleged facts we do not even have to
resort to the rule that all criminal statutes are closely and strictly
construed in favor of the citizen and that no act or omission is
criminal unless specifically and in terms so labeled by a clearly worded
statute (*People v. Benc*, 288 N.Y. 318, 323, and cases cited).

Tested by its history section 1053-a has the same meaning: penalization
of conscious operation of a vehicle in a culpably negligent manner. It
is significant that until this case **\[ ... \]** no attempt was ever
made to penalize, either under section 1053-a or as manslaughter, the
wrong done by one whose foreseeable blackout while driving had
consequences fatal to another person.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Numerous are the diseases and other conditions of a human
being which make it possible or even likely that the afflicted person
will lose control of his automobile. Epilepsy, coronary involvements,
circulatory diseases, nephritis, uremic poisoning, diabetes, Meniere\'s
syndrome, a tendency to fits of sneezing, locking of the knee, muscular
contractions --- any of these common conditions may cause loss of
control of a vehicle for a period long enough to cause a fatal accident.
An automobile traveling at only 30 miles an hour goes 44 feet in a
second. Just what is the court holding here? No less than \[148\] this:
that a driver whose brief blackout lets his car run amuck and kill
another has killed that other by reckless driving. But any such
\"recklessness\" consists necessarily not of the erratic behavior of the
automobile while its driver is unconscious, but of his driving at all
when he knew he was subject to such attacks. Thus, it must be that such
a blackout-prone driver is guilty of reckless driving (Vehicle and
Traffic Law, § 58) whenever and as soon as he steps into the driver\'s
seat of a vehicle. Every time he drives, accident or no accident, he is
subject to criminal prosecution for reckless driving or to revocation of
his operator\'s license (Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 71, subd. 3). And
how many of this State\'s 5,000,000 licensed operators are subject to
such penalties for merely driving the cars they are licensed to drive?
No one knows **\[ ... \]**. It is no answer that prosecutors and juries
will be reasonable or compassionate. A criminal statute whose reach is
so unpredictable violates constitutional rights, as we shall now show.

When section 1053-a was new it was assailed as unconstitutional on the
ground that the language \"operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in
a reckless or culpably negligent manner\" was too indefinite since a
driver could only guess as to what acts or omissions were meant. **\[
... \]** The *manner* in which a car is driven may be investigated by a
jury, grand or trial, to see whether the manner was such as to show a
reckless disregard of consequences. But giving section 1053-a the new
meaning assigned to it permits punishment of one who did not drive in
any forbidden manner but should not have driven at all, according to the
present theory. **\[ ... \]**

A whole new approach may be necessary to the problem of issuing or
refusing drivers\' licenses to epileptics and persons similarly
afflicted (see Barrow and Fabing on Epilepsy and the Law, ch. IV;
Restricted Drivers\' Licenses to Controlled Epileptics, and see 2
U.C.L.A. L. Rev., p. 500 *et seq.*). But the absence of adequate
licensing controls cannot in law or in justice be supplied by criminal
prosecutions of drivers who have violated neither the language nor the
intendment of any criminal law.

The demurrer should be sustained and the indictment dismissed.

State v. Shell

 

 

STATE of Missouri, Respondent, v.\
Jason R. SHELL, Appellant.

No. ED 101640.

Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, DIVISION FIVE.

Filed: May 31, 2016.

Jason Shell (Defendant) appeals the judgment of the Circuit Court of St.
Charles County, entered after a jury trial, convicting him of one count
of distribution of a controlled substance and one count of involuntary
manslaughter. \...

Factual Background

In January 2012, Defendant and James Eyman (Decedent) were planning to
buy heroin. In text messages, Decedent told Defendant that he had \$40
to put toward the purchase. Combined with Defendant\'s \$30, the men
were able to purchase seven doses of heroin. Defendant contacted his
heroin dealer and purchased all \$70 worth of heroin, to be paid back by
Decedent when they met up later in the evening.

After buying the heroin, Defendant went to Decedent\'s parents\' house
--- where Decedent was living at the time --- and picked up Decedent.
The men went to Defendant\'s house, where they each injected themselves
with heroin. Defendant took three doses, while Decedent took four.
Defendant drove Decedent back to his parents\' house around 11:00 p.m.
Decedent went inside, told his mother that he was tired and going to
bed, and went into his bedroom.

At around 1:00 p.m. the next day, Decedent\'s mother went to check on
him because he had not gotten up yet. She discovered Decedent was dead.
Detective William Parks went to the house and saw that Decedent had a
puncture mark on his arm that was consistent with injecting heroin with
a hypodermic needle. Decedent\'s father told Detective Parks that
Decedent had gone out with Defendant the night before. Detective Parks
seized Decedent\'s cell phone and sent it to the cyber-crime unit. The
cell phone revealed Decedent\'s texts with Defendant about their plans
the evening before.

A few days later, Detective Parks went to Defendant\'s workplace to talk
to Defendant about Decedent\'s death. \...Defendant told Detective Parks
about how the men planned to buy heroin, how he picked Decedent up and
how they went back to his house and injected heroin. Defendant

said that he noticed that Decedent was nodding out\[​ 1\]​ and lethargic.
The men drove to a movie

theatre but decided not to see the movie. They returned to Defendant\'s
house, where Defendant offered Decedent to stay the night so that
Defendant could keep an eye on him. Defendant was concerned with
Decedent\'s physical condition because of the amount of heroin that
Decedent injected. Nonetheless, Decedent decided to return home because
he had a curfew. \.... Subsequently, Defendant was charged with
distribution of a controlled substance and first-degree involuntary
manslaughter. \...

At the conclusion of trial, the jury found Defendant guilty of
distribution of a controlled substance and first-degree involuntary
manslaughter. The court sentenced Defendant to concurrent terms of
eighteen years\' imprisonment for distribution and fifteen years\'
imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter. Defendant appeals.

Discussion

Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction
for involuntary manslaughter. \... Defendant argues that he did not have
a duty to seek medical care for Decedent. \...

\...\
Criminal liability \"is premised on a defendant\'s conduct involving
voluntary acts.\" ​State v. Voss, No. ED101396, 488 S.W.3d 97, 110, 2016
WL 145727, at \*6 (Mo.App.E.D. 2016)​ (citing ​State v. Gargus,​ 462 S.W.3d
417, 421 (Mo.App.E.D. 2013)​). A voluntary act can be an omission to
perform an act. ​Id.​ However, a defendant cannot be guilty of an offense
\"based solely upon an omission to perform an act unless the law
defining the offense expressly so provides, or a duty to perform the
omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.\" ​Id.​ \...\
Therefore, we must determine whether Defendant had a duty to seek
medical care for Decedent, and if so, whether he satisfied said duty.
\...

A. Did Defendant have a duty to act?

As noted, because Missouri\'s involuntary manslaughter statute does not
explicitly consider a defendant\'s failure to act, a duty to perform the
omitted act must be otherwise imposed by law\.... There are at least
four situations that may give rise to a duty to act: (1) where a statute
imposes a duty to care for another; (2) where the defendant stands in a
certain status relationship to another; (3) where the defendant assumed
a contractual duty to care for another; and (4) where one has
voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless
person as to prevent others from rendering aid. ​Gargus,​ 462 S.W.3d at
422​ (citing ​Jones v. U.S.,​ 308 F.2d 307, 310 (D.C.Cir. 1962)​). A
defendant stands in a \"certain status relationship\" with the victim in
cases \"where some act or omission on the part of the defendant either
created or increased the risk of injury to \[another\]\" ​Voss, Id.​ at
112​.

Here, Defendant argues that he did not have a duty to seek medical help
for Decedent because none of the situations as laid out in ​Gargus​ apply
to the facts of his case, and specifically that he did not stand in a
\"certain status relationship\" to Decedent. Defendant maintains that
even if the law did impose a duty to act, he satisfied any duty by
inviting Decedent to stay the night, and once Decedent rejected
Defendant\'s offer, Defendant had no further duty to provide help. The
State counters that Defendant did, in fact, have a duty to act because
he voluntarily assumed the care of a vulnerable person (Decedent) and
Decedent was reliant upon Defendant for medical care.

In ​Voss,​ this Court held that the defendant had a duty to act because he
\"created and/or increased the risk of injury to \[the victim\]\" by
providing the victim with heroin, suggesting how much heroin the victim
should use, helping the victim prepare the heroin for ingestion, and
\"leaving the hotel room after \[the victim\] exhibited signs of an
overdose which \[the defendant\] recognized as such.\" ​Voss, Id.​ at 112​,
2016 WL 145727 at \*8. Accordingly, the Court concluded that because the
law imposed a duty to act, a reasonable juror could have concluded that
the defendant

breached said duty by failing to go back to the hotel room or obtain
medical help for the victim. Id.​ at \*8.\
Here, we cannot conclude that Defendant \"created and/or increased the
risk of injury\" to Decedent. The present case is factually
distinguishable from ​Voss,​ where the defendant played a much more active
role in the victim\'s drug overdose. Unlike ​Voss,​ Defendant\'s role in
Decedent\'s heroin use was simply that of distributor. During
Defendant\'s trial, there was no evidence that Defendant suggested how
much heroin for Decedent to use or that Defendant actively helped
Decedent ingest the drugs. While we certainly do not condone
Defendant\'s delivery of heroin to Decedent, the present case does not
rise to the level of creating or increasing the risk of injury. Under
this Court\'s holding in ​Voss,​ such a special relationship requires more
than just delivery of the heroin. Therefore, we conclude that the law
did not impose a duty because Defendant did not create and/or increase
the risk of injury to Decedent.

Regardless, we next consider the State\'s argument that the law imposed
a duty because Defendant voluntarily assumed the care of a vulnerable
person who was reliant upon him for medical care. This Court\'s
reasoning in ​State v. Gargus,​ 462 S.W.3d 417 (Mo.App.E.D. 2013),​ is
instructive. In that case, the defendant was convicted of elder abuse
following the death of her diabetic, bedbound, eighty-one-year-old
mother (the victim). ​Id.​ at 418. On appeal, the defendant argued that
the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support her
conviction because she did not have a duty to act to protect the victim.
​Id.​ at 421. The Court concluded that the defendant voluntarily assumed
care of and secluded the victim. ​Id.​ at 422. However, the Court stated
that Missouri law \"suggests a duty to act arises, whether or not the
defendant has secluded the victim, when the defendant voluntarily
assumes the care of a vulnerable person who is dependent upon the
defendant for basic necessities, such as food, clothing, shelter, and
medical care.\" ​Id.​ at 423. The Court concluded that, even if the
defendant had not secluded the victim, the defendant had a duty to act
because the defendant \"voluntarily assumed the care of \[the victim\],
knowing \[the victim\] was entirely dependent on \[the defendant\] for
her care,\" and as a result, the defendant had a duty to act reasonably
in providing that care. ​Id.​ at 424. As a result, the Court found there
to be sufficient evidence to support criminal liability for the
defendant\'s omissions. Id.\
Here, it is clear that Defendant did not seclude Decedent. In fact, the
evidence shows that Defendant did the opposite --- he returned Decedent
to his parents\' house, where Decedent interacted with his mother.
Nonetheless, under ​Gargus,​ Defendant may have had a duty to act if he
voluntarily assumed the care of Decedent and Decedent was dependent upon
Defendant for medical care. In ​Gargus,​ the victim was diabetic, unable
to walk, confined to a bed. These particular facts, combined with the
\"egregious\" circumstances giving rise to criminal liability, differ
from the present case. Here, we cannot conclude that Defendant
voluntarily assumed the care of Decedent and that Decedent was entirety
dependent upon Defendant for his medical care. While Defendant and
Decedent engaged in drug use together, various other facts established
at trial support our conclusion. After Defendant dropped Decedent back
at his parents\' house,

Decedent had a conversation with his mother. Decedent may have started a
load of laundry, and then he told his mother that he was tired, said
goodnight, and told her that he loved her. These facts, when considered
in the context of Decedent\'s entire evening, show that Decedent was not
entirely dependent upon Defendant. Furthermore, Defendant was not the
only person with whom Decedent had interactions after ingesting the
drugs. Accordingly, we conclude that the law did not impose a duty to
act because Defendant did not seclude Decedent, and Decedent was not
dependent upon Defendant for medical care.

Conclusion

Given the foregoing, we affirm Defendant\'s conviction of Count I,
distribution of a controlled substance. We reverse and vacate
Defendant\'s conviction of Count II, involuntary manslaughter.

Notes and Questions (State v. Shell)

 

By Miriam Contreras and Nicholas Newman

**Notes and Questions**

1\. *Fraternity Hazing Gone Wrong*

Fraternity hazing is a common issue among universities across the
country.

During a night of hazing, *A* is forced by *B* and other fraternity
members to do push-ups for hours while drinking large amounts of
alcohol. *A* begins to have a seizure. Rather than call an ambulance,
*B* states this happens to pledges all the time. *C* does not actively
participate, but does not call for help. *A* is left alone and
eventually dies. Under Shell, has B acted to cause A\'s death? Has C
acted?

Listen
[here](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5012154) to
the real incident this note is modeled on.

2. *Over Charging Defendants*

Twenty states allow prosecutors to bring charges for manslaughter in the
event of drug overdoses. It is argued that allowing prosecutors to bring
these charges acts as an incentive for individuals to avoid distributing
or selling drugs. Can you foresee any counterproductive results of these
laws? Does that depend on how we define public safety?

 

Consider the Defendant in State v. Shell: Why couldn\'t the prosecutor
go after the actual narcotics dealer Defendnat purchased drugs from?
What was Defendants relation to Decedent? Does this seem like the sort
of defendant the charging laws are meant to target?

What is Common Law? (by W. David Ball)

 

What is common law?\
\
**A system:**\
\
The common law system uses case law precedents to determine outcomes. 
Civil law systems (France, Germany, Turkey, Egypt, and Louisiana, among
other jurisdictions) do not use judicial precedents in the same way.\
\
**A source of authority:**\
\
Common law also means the rules that existed before statutes were
created, and largely derive from English (and colonial American)
sources.  So, "at common law", murder was generally "The killing of
another human being with malice aforethought."\
\
Common law has been supplanted by statutes in the United States.  There
is no such thing as "murder", only murder as defined in a particular
statute.\
\
HOWEVER, if there are ambiguities in a statue (and there always are), we
can go back to common law understandings in order to understand what the
words in a statute meant, particularly if the statute is old.\
\
**Two other points.**\
\
1.  The bar tests for common law as a source.  Don't ask me why, but it
does.  So you will get a question like "is this murder" without
reference to a statute. \
\
2.  Common law is not the same as case law.  Martin v. State is a case;
Martin itself is not "common law" (but it's important because we use
cases in a common law system).  If you're using Martin, cite to
that---do not say "according to common law" when you're citing Martin
for its holding.  The same is true for any other case.

General Intent (by W. David Ball)

 

 

MENS REA HANDOUT

 

First major point: general intent is the exception, not the rule.  There
are very few examples of general intent statutes anymore.  It\'s a
holdover from common law.  It will end up mattering for a few special
cases, and when we do mistake.  The overwhelming majority of statutes,
however, are going to be specific intent statutes.

 

So here is how I\'d advise you to think about it.  Ask yourself these
questions.

 

1.  Has a mens rea been specified in the statute?

 

Look for adverbs like knowingly, purposely, recklessly, maliciously,
etc., or phrases like \"with intent to commit a felony\" or \"with
intent to distribute.\"  If you find these words or phrases, the statute
is a specific intent statute.

 

Note\--I used the phrase \"has a mens rea been specified\" because the
mens rea itself need not require "intent"  (or what the MPC calls
"purpose"---that an individual desire the outcome or the conduct). 

 

Think of a crime with a mens rea of reckless\--you don\'t intend the
outcome, but you are aware of (and disregard) the risk.  So there\'s no
intention of the criminal to gain the result, but the statute is a
specific intent statute because a mens rea has been specified.  Same
with a negligent state of mind.

 

If there is nothing specifying a state of mind, there are two
possibilities: the statute is a strict liability statute or a general
intent statute.

 

2.  Is the statute regulatory?  Of recent vintage?  Targeting modern
harms?  Malum prohibitum?  Is the punishment moderate?

 

These are the questions that tend to indicate a statute is strict
liability.  There\'s no mens rea required, but the statute is only
moderately punished (by a small fine, say).  These statutes are likely
to be strict liability statutes.

 

3.  Was the prohibited conduct prohibited at common law?  Does it target
behavior that is malum in se?

 

The classic examples of general intent crimes are battery and rape
statutes WITHOUT A SPECIFIED MENS REA.  I highlight this to underscore
the fact that general intent isn\'t inherent in crimes themselves, but
only in statutes.  That is, if you have a rape or battery statute that
doesn\'t specify a mens rea, it is likely to be a general intent
statute.  But if you have a rape or battery statute that has a specified
mens rea, common law rules don\'t matter.

 

The difference?

 

\"Sexual intercourse, with a woman not his wife, is rape.\"  General
intent

\"Sexual intercourse, with a woman not his wife, with the knowledge that
consent has not been given, is rape.\"  Specific intent

 

This is a very murky area of the law.  The best I can do for you is
this.  Think about these as being malum in se (literally, bad in
themselves, e.g. adultery is bad, hitting someone is bad).  You have
acted voluntarily with a morally blameworthy mindset\--you had sex, you
tried to hit\--so you need not have intended the outcome (to rape or
injure someone).  You have, essentially, intended to do something bad,
so it\'s OK to punish you for what you actually did rather than what you
may (or may not) have thought you were doing.  General intent means,
essentially, that you acted voluntarily, so it tends to collapse with
actus reus here\--but it usually only applies to these malum in se kinds
of actions.

 

No general intent crimes come to mind other than rape and battery, and,
again, in modern statutes the mens rea is often specified for these
crimes.  General intent is an outlier.

 

One last question:

 

4.  Is it a famous strict liability carveout?

 

Statutory rape is the classic example of a strict liability crime. 
Don\'t ask how it is philosophically consonant with rape being general
intent.  Just know that it\'s strict liability.  You need not intend to
have sex with someone under the age of consent, even though it is
punished with severe consequences.  We punish people for mistakes in
this realm.

Regina v. Cunningham

 

 **REGINA v. CUNNINGHAM.**

**\[ ... \]**

BYRNE J. read the following judgment. The appellant was convicted at
Leeds Assizes upon an indictment framed under section 23 of the Offences
against the Person Act, 1861, which charged that he unlawfully and
maliciously caused to be taken by Sarah Wade a certain noxious thing,
namely, coal gas, so as thereby to endanger the life of the said Sarah
Wade.

The facts were that the appellant was engaged to be married and his
prospective mother-­in-law was the tenant of a house, No. 7A, Bakes
Street, Bradford, which was unoccupied, but which was to be occupied by
the appellant after his marriage. Mrs. Wade and her husband, an elderly
couple, lived in the house next door. At one time the two houses had
been one, but when the building was converted into two houses a wall had
been erected to divide the cellars of the two houses, and that wall was
composed of rubble loosely cemented.

On the evening of January 17, 1957, the appellant went the cellar of No.
7A, Bakes Street, wrenched the gas meter from the gas pipes and stole
it, together with its contents, and in a second indictment he was
charged with the larceny of the gas meter and its contents. To that
indictment he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months
imprisonment. In respect of that matter he does not appeal.

The facts were not really in dispute, and in a statement to a police
officer the appellant said: "All right, I will tell you. I was short of
money, I had been off work for three days, I got eight shillings from
the gas meter. I tore it the wall and threw it away.\" Although there
was a stop tap within two feet of the meter the appellant did not turn
off the gas, with the result that a very considerable volume of gas
escaped, some of which seeped through the wall of the cellar and
partially asphyxiated Mrs. Wade, who was asleep in her bedroom next
door, with the result that her life was endangered.

At the close of the case for the prosecution, Mr. Brodie, who appeared
for the appellant at the trial and who has appeared for him again in
this court submitted that there was no case to go to the jury, but the
judge, quite rightly in our opinion, rejected this submission. The
appellant did not give evidence.

The act of the appellant was clearly unlawful and therefore the real
question for the jury was whether it was also malicious within the
meaning of section 23 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.

Before this court Mr. Brodie has taken three points, all dependent upon
the construction of that section. Section 23 provides:

> "Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously administer to or cause to
> be administered to or taken by any other person any poison or other
> destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger the life of
> such person, or so as thereby to inflict upon such person any grievous
> bodily harm, shall be guilty of felony . . ."

Mr. Brodie argued, first, that mens rea of some kind is necessary.
Secondly, that the nature of the mens rea required is that the appellant
must intend to do the particular kind of harm that was done, or,
alternatively, that he must foresee that that harm may occur yet
nevertheless continue recklessly to do the act. Thirdly, that the judge
misdirected the jury as to the meaning of the word \"maliciously." He
cited the following cases: *Reg. v.
Pembliton*[^\[1\*\]^](#X2c911e868f4d0a2184ac917ec106977f35fd76a), *Reg.
v. Latimer*[^\[2\*\]^](#X33c84a58aa61f01dd99283acf06b3a453241ae5) and
*Reg v. Faulkner*[^\[3\*\]^](#X6ea1d06b738534c08692cd2f37a763538d64214).
In reply, Mr. Snowden, on behalf of the Crown, cited *Reg. v.
Martin*.[^\[4\*\]^](#Xa0703c3209932e27fdafd0bf2007f93321e0b2d)

We have considered those cases, and we have also considered, in the
light of those cases, the following principle which was propounded by
the late Professor C. S. Kenny in the first edition of his Outlines of
Criminal Law published in 1902 and repeated at p. 186 of the 16th
edition edited by Mr. J. W. Cecil Turner and published in 1952:

> "In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in
> the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either
> (1) An actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact
> was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or
> not (i.e., the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm
> might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It
> is neither limited to nor does it indeed require any ill will
> towards the person injured.\"

 

**\[ ... \]**

We think that this is an accurate statement of the law. **\[ ... \]** In
our opinion the word maliciously in a statutory crime postulates
foresight of consequence.

In his summing-up Oliver J. directed the jury as follows:

> "You will observe that there is nothing there about \'with intention
> that that person should take it.\' He has not got to intend that it
> should be taken; it is sufficient that by his unlawful and malicious
> act he causes it to be taken. What you have to decide here, then, is
> whether, when he loosed that frightful cloud of coal gas into the
> house which he shared with this old lady, he caused her to take it by
> his unlawful and malicious action. \'Unlawful\' does not need any
> definition. It is something forbidden by law. What about
> \'malicious\'? \'Malicious\' for this purpose means wicked \--
> something which he has no business to do and perfectly well knows it.
> \'Wicked\' is as good a definition as any other which you would get."
>
> "The facts which face you (and they are uncontradicted and undisputed;
> the prisoner has not gone into the box to seek to give any particular
> explanation) are these. Living in the house, which was now two houses
> but which had once been one and had been rather roughly divided, the
> prisoner quite deliberately, intending to steal the money that was in
> the meter . . . broke the gas meter away from the supply pipes and
> thus released the mains supply of gas at large into that house. When
> he did that he knew that this old lady and her husband were living
> next door to him. The gas meter was in a cellar. The wall which
> divided his cellar from the cellar next door was a kind of honeycomb
> wall through which gas could very well go, so that when he loosed that
> cloud of gas into that place he must have known perfectly well that
> gas would percolate all over the house. If it were part of this
> offense - which it is not -that he intended to poison the old lady, I
> should have left it to you to decide, and I should have told you that
> there was evidence on which you could find that he "intended that,
> since he did an action which he must have known would result in that.
> As I have already told you, it is not necessary to prove that he
> intended to do it; it is quite enough that what he did was done
> unlawfully and maliciously.\"

 

With the utmost respect to the learned judge, we think it is incorrect
to say that the word \"malicious\" in a statutory offence merely means
wicked. We think the judge was, in effect, telling the jury that if they
were satisfied that the appellant acted wickedly - and he had clearly
acted wickedly in stealing the gas meter and its contents - they ought
to find that he had acted maliciously in causing the gas to be taken by
Mrs. Wade so as thereby to endanger her life.

In our view it should have been left to the jury to decide whether, even
if the appellant did not intend the injury to Mrs. Wade, he foresaw that
the removal of the gas meter might cause injury to someone but
nevertheless removed it. We are unable to say that a reasonable jury,
properly directed as to the meaning of the word maliciously in the
context of section 23, would without doubt have convicted.

In these circumstances this court has no alternative but to allow the
appeal and quash the conviction.

State v. Blurton

 

South Carolina Court of Appeals

342 S.C. 500, 537 S.E.2d 291

No. 3236

2000-08-07

537 S.E.2d 291

**\[ ... \]**

CURETON, Judge:

A jury convicted Gregory R. Blurton of two counts of armed robbery,
kidnapping, grand larceny of a motor vehicle, and failure to stop for a
blue light. The trial court sentenced Blurton to three life sentences
for the kidnapping and armed robbery convictions, ten years for grand
larceny, and three years for failing to stop for a blue light, with all
sentences running concurrently. Blurton appeals. We reverse and remand
for a new trial.

*FACTS*

On April 6, 1997, Blurton entered the Orangeburg WalMart between 11:30
p.m. and 12:00 midnight. After asking for Roger, an assistant manager
who was not working that night, Blurton told assistant manager Brandon
Beckman he needed access to the electrical room to do some work.[^3]
**\[ ... \]**

As Blurton and Beckman walked away, Blurton pulled out a gun and
demanded that Beckman take him to the cash office and give him the money
inside. Brenda Arant, the cash office clerk, was still inside the
office. Blurton ordered Beckman to get on the floor and demanded Arant
fill a shopping bag with money. Blurton screamed his orders and
threatened to shoot Beckman and Arant if they did not cooperate. **\[
... \]**

At trial, Blurton did not deny committing the acts of which he was
accused, but argued a lack of criminal intent. During his testimony, he
explained that James Mayfield, another assistant manager of the
Orangeburg Wal-Mart, was a former Navy SEAL who also worked for the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He further explained that Mayfield
recruited him to assist the CIA in its effort to infiltrate a drug
cartel. In exchange for his assistance, Blurton was promised a new
identity and a presidential pardon for several bank robberies he
committed in the 1970s. Blurton claimed Mayfield gave him surveillance
and firearms training and loaned him hand to hand combat videos
developed by a Navy SEAL instructor. Additionally, Blurton testified he
had completed several assignments in relation to the CIA's infiltration
plan, codenamed "Operation Double White."

The "staged" robbery of the Wal-Mart was Phase Three of the operation,
an attempt to convince the drug cartel that Blurton was a wanted and
dangerous man, thereby facilitating his infiltration of the group. He
explained the robbery was fake and, according to Mayfield, both Beckman
and Roger were aware of the plan. **\[ ... \]**Blurton was supposed to
leave the money at a specific drop location at the back of a hotel,
where Mayfield would retrieve it and promptly return it to Wal-Mart on
behalf of the CIA. According to Blurton, he had to pretend the robbery
was real to put on a "show" for the security cameras and members of the
local sheriffs department who, according to Mayfield, were involved with
the drug cartel.

**\[ ... \]**

Although Blurton consistently maintained that he was working for the CIA
when he committed the acts involved in each of the charged offenses, his
trial counsel simply attempted to prove Blurton genuinely believed he
was a CIA operative at the time of the alleged crimes and thus lacked
criminal intent.

*LAW/ANALYSIS*

I. Evidentiary Issues

Blurton's trial counsel attempted to present evidence which would
corroborate his explanation of events and support his defense of lack of
criminal intent. The evidence included (1) taped telephone conversations
between Blurton and Mayfield; (2) testimony that the investigating
officer thought Blurton actually believed he was part of a CIA
operation; (3) testimony that others heard and believed Mayfield's claim
that he was a former Navy SEAL; and (4) two newspaper articles which
showed Mayfield convinced the local newspaper he was a Navy SEAL. The
trial court excluded this evidence. **\[ ... \]**

*A. Taped Conversations*

Blurton's counsel sought to admit taped telephone conversations between
Blurton and Mayfield which were made without Mayfield's knowledge. **\[
... \]**During the conversations, Mayfield repeatedly affirmed or failed
to deny Blurton's statements that Mayfield had involved him in the CIA
operation and that the robbery was staged. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Because these conversations would have added credence to
Blurton's defense that he lacked criminal intent and were not hearsay,
the trial court erred in excluding them. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

*C. Whether Others Believed Mayfield to be a Navy SEAL*

Blurton also attempted to introduce testimony that other people at
Wal-Mart heard and believed Mayfield's statements that he was a former
Navy SEAL. **\[ ... \]**Blurton asserts the court abused its discretion
in excluding the evidence. We agree.

**\[ ... \]**

Essentially, the excluded testimony would have shown that it was common
belief among Wal-Mart employees, fueled by Mayfield's own statements,
that he was a former Navy SEAL. The fact that Mayfield told this
falsehood about his past to others, and that they believed him, tended
to corroborate Blurton's claimed belief in the same falsehood. This
would help explain why Blurton would believe Mayfield's claim that he
worked for the CIA. **\[ ... \]**Thus, the evidence shows Blurton's
state of mind at the time he committed the crimes. The evidence was
relevant to Blurton's argument that he lacked criminal intent, a
necessary element of the charged crimes. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed, Blurton's appealed convictions are reversed
and his case is remanded for a new trial.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

187 Ill. App. 3d 234

No. 1---86---2651

1989-08-02

JUSTICE CERDA

delivered the opinion of the court:

The defendant, William J. Conley, was charged with two counts of
aggravated battery based on permanent disability and great bodily harm.
(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 12 --- 4(a).) He was found guilty
after a jury trial of aggravated battery based solely on permanent
disability on July 17, 1986. The defendant's motions for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial were denied, and the
defendant was sentenced to 30 months' probation including 40 days of
periodic imprisonment. On appeal, it is contended that: (1) the State
failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim incurred a
permanent disability and that the defendant intended to inflict a
permanent disability; **\[ ... \]**For the following reasons, we affirm.

The defendant was charged with aggravated battery in connection with a
fight which occurred at a party on September 28, 1985, in unincorporated
Orland Township. Approximately 200 high school students attended the
party and paid admission to drink unlimited beer. One of those students,
Sean O'Connell, attended the party with several friends. At some point
during the party, Sean's group was approached by a group of 20 boys who
apparently thought that someone in Sean's group had said something
derogatory. Sean's group denied making a statement and said they did not
want any trouble. Shortly thereafter, Sean and his friends decided to
leave and began walking toward their car which was parked a half block
south of the party.

A group of people were walking toward the party from across the street
when someone from that group shouted "There's those guys from the
party." Someone emerged from that group and approached Sean, who had
been walking with his friend Marty Carroll 10 to 15 steps behind two
other friends, **\[ ... \]**That individual demanded that Marty give him
a can of beer from his six-pack. Marty refused, and the individual
struck Sean in the face with a wine bottle, causing Sean to fall to the
ground. The offender attempted to hit Marty, but missed as Marty was
able to duck. Sean sustained broken upper and lower jaws and four broken
bones in the area between the bridge of his nose and the lower left
cheek. Sean lost one tooth and had root canal surgery to reposition 10
teeth that had been damaged. Expert testimony revealed that Sean has a
permanent condition called mucosal mouth and permanent partial numbness
in one lip. The expert also testified that the life expectancy of the
damaged teeth might be diminished by a third or a half.

**\[ ... \]**

The defendant initially contends on appeal that the State failed to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sean O'Connell incurred a permanent
disability. Section 12 --- 4(a) of the Criminal Code of 1961 provides
that: "\[a\] person who, in committing a battery, intentionally or
knowingly causes great bodily harm, or permanent disability or
disfigurement commits aggravated battery." (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch.
38, par. 12 --- 4(a).) **\[ ... \]**The defendant does not dispute that
Sean lost a tooth or that surgery was required to repair damaged teeth.
The defendant also does not dispute that Sean will have permanent
partial numbness in one lip or suffer from a condition called mucosal
mouth. **\[ ... \]**

The defendant further argues that the State failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he intended to inflict any permanent disability.
The thrust of defendant's argument is that under section 12 --- 4(a), a
person must intend to bring about the particular harm defined in the
statute. The defendant asserts that while it may be inferred from his
conduct that he intended to cause harm, it does not follow that he
intended to cause permanent disability. The State contends it is not
necessary that the defendant intended to bring about the particular
injuries that resulted. The State maintains it met its burden by showing
that the defendant intentionally struck Sean.

The law on this question is unclear. The defendant relies upon *People
v. Crosser* (1983), 117 Ill. App. 3d 24, 27, 452 N.E.2d 857, and *Bay
State Insurance Co. v. Wilson* (1982), 108 Ill. App. 3d 1096, 440 N.E.2d
131, which both hold that aggravated battery is a specific intent crime.
The State, however, relies upon *People v. Allen* (1969), 117 Ill. App.
2d 20, 254 N.E.2d 103. In *Allen,* the court wrote that in committing
the offense of aggravated battery, "the only mental state required is
that the accused knowingly and intentionally cause the social harm
defined in the statute, no premeditation or malice being necessary."
*(Allen,* 117 Ill. App. 2d at 27-28.) The court then went on to state
that it is not necessary that the defendant intended to cause the
particular injury which resulted. *(Allen,* 117 Ill. App. 2d at 28.)
**\[ ... \]**

For proper resolution of this issue, it is best to return to the
statutory language. Section 12 --- 4(a) employs the terms "intentionally
or knowingly" to describe the required mental state. The relevant
statutes state:

> "4 --- 4. Intent. A person intends, or acts intentionally or with
> intent, to accomplish a result or engage in conduct described by the
> statute defining the offense, when his conscious objective or purpose
> is to accomplish that result or engage in that conduct." (Ill. Rev.
> Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 4 --- 4.)
>
> "4 --- 5. Knowledge. A person knows or acts knowingly or with
> knowledge of:
>
> \(b\) The result of his conduct, described by the statute defining the
> offense, when he is consciously aware that such result is practically
> certain to be caused by his conduct." (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38,
> par. 4 --- 5.)

Section 12 --- 4(a) defines aggravated battery as the commission of a
battery where the offender intentionally or knowingly causes great
bodily harm, or permanent disability or disfigurement. Because the
offense is defined in terms of result, the State has the burden of
proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant either had a
"conscious objective" to achieve the harm defined, or that the defendant
was "consciously aware" that the harm defined was "practically certain
to be caused by his conduct." (See *People v. Herr* (1980), 87 Ill. App.
3d 819, 821, 409 N.E.2d 442.) **\[ ... \]**

Although the State must establish the specific intent to bring about
great bodily harm, or permanent disability or disfigurement under
section 12 --- 4(a), problems of proof are alleviated to the extent that
the ordinary presumption that one intends the natural and probable
consequences of his actions shifts the burden of production, though not
persuasion, to the defendant. *(Farrell,* 89 Ill. App. 3d at 265.) If
the defendant presents evidence contrary to the presumption, then the
presumption ceases to have effect, and the trier of fact considers all
the evidence and the natural inferences drawn therefrom. *(Farrell,* 89
Ill. App. 3d at 265.) Intent can be inferred from the surrounding
circumstances, the offender's words, the weapon used, and the force of
the blow. (See, *e.g., Macklin v. Commonwealth Life & Accident Co.*
(1970), 121 Ill. App. 2d 119, 126-27, 257 N.E.2d 256.) As the
defendant's theory of the case was mistaken identity, there was no
evidence introduced negating the presumption of intent. However, even if
Conley had denied any intention to inflict permanent disability, the
surrounding circumstances, the use of a bot-tie, the absence of warning
and the force of the blow are facts from which the jury could reasonably
infer the intent to cause permanent disability. Therefore, we find the
evidence sufficient to support a finding of intent to cause permanent
disability beyond a reasonable doubt.

State v. Nations

 

Missouri Court of Appeals

676 S.W.2d 282

No. 45349

1984-08-28

Harvey I. Feldman, Clayton, for appellant.

George R. Westfall, Pros. Atty. by James E. Baker, Asst. Pros. Atty.,
Clayton, for respondent.

SATZ, Judge.

Defendant, Sandra Nations, owns and operates the Main Street Disco, in
which police officers found a scantily clad sixteen year old girl
"dancing" for "tips". Consequently, defendant was charged with
endangering the welfare of a child "less than seventeen years old," §
568.050 RSMo 1978.[^4] Defendant was convicted and fined \$1,000.00.
Defendant appeals. We reverse.

Defendant contends the state failed to make a submissible case.
Defendant failed to preserve this issue for review on appeal.[^5] We
must, however, consider the issue of submissibility under the doctrine
of plain error. It is manifest injustice for a trial court to submit a
case to the fact finder on evidence insufficient to make a submissible
case. *E.g., State v. Russell,* 581 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Mo.App.1979).

Specifically, defendant argues the state failed to show she knew the
child was under seventeen and, therefore, failed to show she had the
requisite intent to endanger the welfare of a child "less than seventeen
years old." We agree.

The pertinent part of § 568.050 provides:

> "1. A person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a child
> if:
>
> ![](media/image1.png){width="1.4791666666666667in"
> height="0.4791666666666667in"}
>
> \(2\) He knowingly encourages, aids or causes a child less than
> seventeen years old to engage in any conduct which causes or tends to
> cause the child to come within the provisions of subdivision (l)(c) ..
> of section 211.031, RSMo \...."

The reference to "subdivision (l)(c)" is to § 211.031.l(l)(c) RSMo
(Supp. 1976), which was in effect when § 568.050 was enacted. This
"subdivision" vested in the juvenile court exclusive original
jurisdiction of any proceeding in which a child is alleged to be in need
of care and treatment because "\[t\]he behavior, environment or
associations of the child are injurious to his welfare or to the welfare
of others".[^6] Thus, § 568.050 requires the state to prove the
defendant "knowingly" encouraged a child "less than seventeen years old"
to engage in conduct tending to injure the child's welfare, and
"knowing" the child to be less than seventeen is a material element of
the crime. *See* § 562.021.

"Knowingly" is a term of art, whose meaning is limited to the definition
given to it by our present Criminal Code. Literally read, the Code
defines "knowingly" as actual knowledge --- "A person *'acts
knowingly',* or with knowledge, (1) with respect \... to attendant
circumstances when he is aware \... that those circumstances exist \_"
(Emphasis original). § 562.016.3.[^7] So read, this definition of
"knowingly" or "knowledge" excludes those cases in which "the fact \[in
issue\] would have been known had not the person wilfully 'shut his
eyes' in order to avoid knowing." Perkins, *Criminal Law* 942 (2d ed.
1969). The Model Penal Code, the source of our Criminal Code, does not
ex-elude these cases from its definition of "knowingly". Instead, the
Model Penal Code proposes that "\[w\]hen knowledge of the *existence of
a particular fact* is an element of an offense, such knowledge is
established if a person is aware of a high probability of its
existence\_" (Emphasis added). Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) (Proposed
Official Draft 1962). This definition sounds more like a restatement of
the definition of "recklessly" than "knowingly".[^8] The similarity is
intentional. The Model Penal Code simply proposes that wilful blindness
to a fact "be viewed as one of acting knowingly when what is involved is
a matter of existing fact, but not when what is involved is the result
of the defendant's conduct, necessarily a matter of the future at the
time of acting." [^9] Thus, as noted, the Model Penal Code proposes that
"\[w\]hen knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element
of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a
high probability of its existence Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) (Proposed
Official Draft 1962).

Our legislature, however, did not enact this proposed definition of
"knowingly". Although the definitions of "knowingly" and "recklessly" in
our Criminal Code are almost identical to the primary definitions of
these terms as proposed in the Model Penal Code, *see* Model Penal Code
§ 2.02(2)(b)-(c) (Proposed Official Draft 1962), the Model Penal Code's
proposed expanded definition of "knowingly", encompassing wilful
blindness of a fact, is absent from our Criminal Code. The sensible, if
not compelling, inference is that our legislature rejected the expansion
of the definition of "knowingly" to include wilful blindness of a fact
and chose to limit the definition of "knowingly" to actual knowledge of
the fact.[^10] Thus, in the instant case, the state's burden was to show
defendant actually was aware the child was under seventeen, a heavier
burden than showing there was a "high probability" that defendant was
aware the child was under seventeen. In short, the state's burden was to
prove defendant acted "knowingly", not just "recklessly". The state
proved, however, that defendant acted "recklessly", not "knowingly".
This we conclude from our review of the record.

In our review of the record, we do not weigh the evidence; rather, we
simply determine whether there was sufficient proof for the fact finder
to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. *E.g., State v.
Turner,* 623 S.W.2d 4, 6 (Mo. banc 1981), *cert. denied,* 456 U.S. 931,
102 S.Ct. 1982, 72 L.Ed.2d 448 (1982). In so doing, we consider only
those facts and reasonable inferences favorable to the state. *E.g.,
State v. Franco,* 544 S.W.2d 533, 534 (Mo. banc 1976), *cert. denied,*
431 U.S. 957, 97 S.Ct. 2682, 53 L.Ed.2d 275 (1977).

The record shows that, at the time of the incident, the child was
sixteen years old. When the police arrived, the child was "dancing" on
stage for "tips" with another female. The police watched her dance for
some five to seven minutes before approaching defendant in the service
area of the bar. Believing that one of the girls appeared to be "young,"
the police questioned defendant about the child's age. Defendant told
them that both girls were of legal age and that she had checked the
girls' identification when she hired them. When the police questioned
the child, she initially stated that she was eighteen but later admitted
that she was only sixteen. She had no identification.

Aside from the child's age, these facts were established by the
testimony of a police officer. The state also called the child as a
witness. Her testimony was no help to the state. She testified the
defendant asked her for identification just prior to the police
arriving, and she was merely crossing the stage to get her
identification when the police took her into custody.[^11] Nor can the
state secure help from the defendant's testimony. She simply
corroborated the child's testimony; i.e., she asked the child for her
identification; the child replied she would "show it to \[her\] in a
minute"; the police then took the child into custody.

These facts simply show defendant was untruthful. Defendant could not
have checked the child's identification, because the child had no
identification with her that day, the first day defendant "hired" the
child. This does not prove that defendant knew the child was less than
seventeen years old. At best, it proves defendant did not know or
refused to learn\'the child's age. The latter is the best case for the
state. But defendant's refusal to learn the age of this "young" child
who was "dancing" "scantily clad" in her disco bar simply proves that
defendant was "aware of a high probability" that the child was under
seventeen, or, stated otherwise, in the definitional language of our
Criminal Code, proves that defendant was conscious of "a substantial and
unjustifiable risk" that the child was under seventeen and that
defendant's disregard of the risk was a "gross deviation" from the norm.
*See* § 562.016.-4. This, however, is not "knowledge" under our Criminal
Code. It is "recklessness", nothing more. Having failed to prove
defendant knew the child's age was less than seventeen, the state failed
to make a submissible case.[^12]

HILL, J.:

Lance L. Miles appeals his conviction for trafficking in illegal drugs
in violation of section 44-53-370(e)(3) of the South Carolina Code
(Supp. 2016). He argues the trial court erred by: (1) instructing the
jury, in reply to a question they posed during deliberation, that the
State did not have to prove Miles knew the drugs were oxycodone; (2)
denying his directed verdict motion; and (3) admitting three statements
he contends were obtained in violation of *Miranda v.* Arizona, 384 U.S.
436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We affirm.

I---I

While scanning parcels for illegal drugs at the Federal Express office
in West Columbia, agents from the Lexington County Sheriffs Office
became suspicious of a package. They arranged for a controlled delivery
to the listed address, which was within an apartment complex. *\...
\[T\]*hey observed the delivery person ring the doorbell and leave the
package by the front door. A few moments later, an agent noticed Miles
exit a nearby apartment and begin walking around the parking lot. The
agent then saw a young female emerge from the delivery address. She
looked at the box, got on her phone, quickly hung up and went back
inside. Miles then got on his phone while walking towards the box. Miles
picked up the box and started back to his apartment. Seeing the agents
advancing to intercept him, he tried to ditch the box. The agents
apprehended and handcuffed him.

**\[ ... \]** Upon obtaining a search warrant and Miles' consent, the
agents opened the box and discovered three hundred pills that a chemist
later testified contained a total of nine grams of oxycodone. **\[ ...
\]**

Miles was indicted for trafficking in illegal drugs, in violation of
section 44-53-370(e)(3). He did not testify at his trial and moved
unsuccessfully for directed verdict, arguing in part there was
insufficient evidence he knew the box contained oxycodone. During the
jury charge, the trial court gave the following instruction:

> Mr. Miles is charged with trafficking in illegal drugs and in this
> case we are referring to \[ojxycodone. The State must prove beyond a
> reasonable doubt that the Defendant knowingly delivered, purchased,
> brought into this state, provided financial assistance or otherwise
> aided, abetted, attempted or conspired to sell, deliver, purchase, or
> bring into this state and was knowingly in actual or constructive
> possession or knowingly attempted to become in actual or constructive
> possession\] of the \[o\]xyeodone. Possession may be either \...
> actual or constructive.

The trial court charged that the State bore the burden of proving the
amount of oxycodone was more than four grams. The trial court further
instructed that the State had to prove criminal intent, which required a
"conscious wrongdoing," and that intent may be inferred from the conduct
of the parties and other circumstances. After deliberating for some
time, the jury asked the following question: "Does the \[S\]tate have to
prove that the defendant knowingly brought into the state four grams or
more of \[ojxycodone or just any amount of illegal drugs in order to
consider this trafficking?"

The trial court, over Miles' objection, replied to the jury as follows:

> \[T\]he law in South Carolina is the State does not have to prove that
> the Defendant knew that the drugs in the package were \[ojxyeodone,
> just that he knew that the package contained illegal drugs. However,
> the State does have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
> illegal drugs that were in the package w\[ere\] more than four grams
> of \[ojxycodone.

The jury later returned with a verdict of guilty. **\[ ... \]**

II\.

Miles' primary argument on appeal is the trial court's supplemental
charge misinformed the jury that the State did not need to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that Miles knew the drug he possessed was oxycodone.
We review jury instructions to determine whether they, as a whole,
adequately communicate the law in light of the issues and evidence
presented at trial. *State v. Logan,* 405 S.C. 83, 90, 747 S.E.2d 444,
448 (2013).

Section 44-53-370(e)(3) provides in part:

> Any person who *knowingly* sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers,
> purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial
> assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell,
> manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State,
> or who is *knowingly* in actual or constructive possession or who
> *knowingly* attempts to become in actual or constructive possession
> of: \... four grams or more of any morphine, opium, salt, isomer, or
> salt of an isomer thereof, including heroin, as described in Section
> 44-53-190 or 44-53-210, or four grams or more of any mixture
> containing any of these substances, is guilty of a felony which is
> known as "trafficking in illegal drugs"\....

(emphases added).

Miles contends the term "knowingly" as used in subsection (e) applies to
each element of the trafficking offense, including the specific type of
drugs listed in (e)(3). The issue of whether trafficking requires proof
that the defendant not only knowingly intended to "sell\[ \],
manufacture\[ \], cultivate\[ \] \..." or "posses\[ \]" illegal drugs,
but also had knowledge of the precise identity of the illegal drug being
trafficked, has, surprisingly, never been addressed by our appellate
courts.

We are mindful that "statutory interpretation begins (and often ends)
with the text of the statute in question. Absent an ambiguity, there is
nothing for a court to construe, that is, a court should not look beyond
the statutory text to discern its meaning." *Smith v. Tiffany,* 419 S.C.
548, 555-56, 799 S.E.2d 479, 483 (2017) (citations omitted).

Courts grapple often with that tricky adverb "knowingly." In *United
States v. Jones,* 471 F.3d 535, 538 (4th Cir. 2006), the court construed
a federal statute that punished "\[a\] person who knowingly transports
an individual who has not attained the age of 18 years in interstate or
foreign commerce \... with intent that the individual engage in
prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be
charged with a criminal offense." (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (2000 &
Supp. 2003)). Rejecting the argument that the government was required to
prove the defendant knew the person transported was a minor, Judge
Wilkinson noted:

> \[Construction of the statute demonstrates that it does not require
> proof of the defendant's knowledge of the victim's minority. It is
> clear from the grammatical structure of § 2423(a) that the adverb
> "knowingly" modifies the verb "transports." Adverbs generally modify
> verbs, and the thought that they would typically modify the infinite
> hereafters of statutory sentences would cause grammarians to recoil.
> We see nothing on the face of this statute to suggest that the
> modifying force of "knowingly" extends beyond the verb to other
> components of the offense.

*Id.* at 539.

The United States Supreme Court has not been so gun-shy about the
adverb.[^13] They ordinarily read a "statute that introduces the
elements of a crime with the word 'knowingly' as applying that word to
each element." *Flores-Figueroa v. United States,* 556 U.S. 646, 652,
129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). They have also found "the word
'knowingly' applies not just to the statute's verbs but also to the
object of those verbs." *McFadden v. United States,* --- U.S. -, 135
S.Ct. 2298, 2304, 192 L.Ed.2d 260 (2015).

But the Court has not gone so far as to hold that a criminal statute
that opens with "knowingly" invariably requires each element be proven
by that level of intent. It is commonplace that "different elements of
the same offense can require different mental states." *Staples v.
United States,* 511 U.S. 600, 609, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608
(1994). Even in *Flores-Figueroa,* the Court acknowledged that
"knowingly" does not always modify every element, particularly where the
statutory sentences at issue "involve special contexts or \...
background circumstances that call for such a reading." 556 U.S. at 652,
129 S.Ct. 1886. The Court emphasized that "the inquiry into a sentence's
meaning is a contextual one." *Id.; see also Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc.
v. Hertz Corp.,* 782 F.2d 381, 385 (2d Cir. 1986) ("Fundamental to any
task of interpretation is the principle that text must yield to
context.") (Friendly, J.).

Our duty is to determine legislative intent, and the text of the statute
is often the best evidence of that intent. *Hodges v. Rainey,* 341 S.C.
79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000). Yet the text "must be construed in
context and in light of the intended purpose of the statute in a manner
which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general
purpose." *Cabiness v. Town of James Island,* 393 S.C. 176, 192, 712
S.E.2d 416, 425 (2011) (citation and internal quotations omitted).

We find that by using "knowingly" in subsection (e), the Legislature did
not intend to require the State to prove a defendant knew the specific
type of illegal drug he was trafficking. Section 44-53-370 is concerned
with criminalizing numerous forms of conduct involving illegal drugs.
Thus, subsection (c) decrees "\[i\]t shall be unlawful for any person
knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance," subject
to certain exceptions not relevant here. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-370(c)
(Supp. 2016). Our supreme court has held the language now codified in
subsection (c) requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant knew he possessed a "controlled substance." *State v.
Attardo,* 263 S.C. 546, 549, 211 S.E.2d 868, 869 (1975). Subsection (d)
then sets forth the penalties for possession based on the type of
controlled substance. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-370(d) (Supp. 2016).

This brings us to trafficking, subsection (e). Tellingly, our supreme
court has explained "\[i\]t is the amount of \[the controlled
substance\], rather than the criminal act, which triggers the
trafficking statute, and distinguishes trafficking from distribution and
simple possession." *State v. Raffaldt,* 318 S.C. 110, 117, 456 S.E.2d
390, 394 (1995). While the court in *Rajfaldt* was not confronted with
the mental state required for a trafficking conviction, that issue was
addressed in *State v. Taylor,* 323 S.C. 162, 166, 473 S.E.2d 817, 819
(Ct. App. 1996). In *Taylor,* the defendant was charged with trafficking
more than ten grams of crank, in violation of section 44-53-375(C) of
the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1995), which contains language nearly
identical to section 44-53-370(e), including placement of the adverb
"knowingly." Taylor argued the language required the trial court to
charge the jury that "they could not find \[her\] guilty of trafficking
in crank unless she knew there were ten grams or more." *Taylor,* 323
S.C. at 167, 473 S.E.2d at 819. Relying on *Raffaldt,* we disagreed.
*Id.*

*Rajfaldt* and *Taylor* illuminate the "special context" revealed by
viewing section 44-53-370 as a whole. Because section 44-53-370(c) only
requires knowledge that the substance is "controlled," and because
*Rajfaldt* and *Taylor* tell us the only difference between the elements
of distribution and simple possession and the elements of trafficking is
the amount of the controlled substance involved, there is no reason to
suspect the Legislature meant to require knowledge of the specific type
of controlled substance in trafficking prosecutions. Miles'
interpretation depends upon isolating "knowingly" in subsection (e) and
extending its modifying reach not only to "possession," but to the
specific type of drugs listed. Magnifying individual words of a statute
and insisting they be interpreted concretely can lead to strange
results. One could, for example, myopically diagram subsection (e)(3)
and conclude it criminalizes the possession of more than four grams of
table salt, or even the conduct of the delivery person in this case.
Further, were we to adopt Miles' version of subsection (e), the State
would have to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant
not only knew the drugs were oxycodone, but also knew that oxycodone is
a "morphine, opium, salt, isomer, or salt of an isomer thereof,
including heroin, as described in Section 44-63-190 or 44-53-210, or
\... any mixture containing any of these substances." We doubt the
Legislature, in passing the drug trafficking laws, meant to create a
scenario where a defendant is culpable only if armed with a proficiency
in chemistry on par with a pharmacist or Walter White.[^14] That is why
considering the words in their surrounding environment is essential,
especially here where the statute runs to nearly five-thousand words and
represents the Legislature's will in the massive field of drug
interdiction. Given this background, "\[i\]f ever we are justified in
reading a statute, not narrowly as through a keyhole, but in the broad
light of the evils it aimed at and the good it hoped for, it is here."
*United States ex rel Marcus v. Hess,* 317 U.S. 537, 557, 63 S.Ct. 379,
87 L.Ed. 443 (1943) (Jackson, J., dissenting).[^15]

When a statute can be read in its ordinary sense, courts have no right
to engineer an extraordinary one. That the Legislature titled the
offense defined by subsection (e)(3) as "trafficking in illegal drugs"
affirms our conclusion that a defendant need not know the precise
identity of the controlled substance to be guilty. *See Univ. of S.C. v.
Elliott,* 248 S.C. 218, 221, 149 S.E.2d 433, 434 (1966) ("\[I\]t is
proper to consider the title or caption of an act in aid of construction
to show the intent of the legislature."). This sense becomes inescapable
when we consider subsection (e)(3)'s reference to sections 44-53-190 and
44-53-210 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2016), which set forth
Schedules I and II governing classification of controlled substances.
While we can interpret statutes by bringing in rules of grammar, logic,
and other tools, we must be careful not to construe common sense out.

Courts in many other states share our conclusion that proving the
defendant knew the specific type of drug is not required in trafficking
and other controlled substance offenses. **\[ ... \]**

We cannot leave this issue without discussing the important canon of
statutory construction that penal statutes are to be strictly construed.
This rule of lenity applies when a criminal statute is ambiguous, and
requires any doubt about a statute's scope be resolved in the
defendant's favor. *Berry v. State,* 381 S.C. 630, 633, 675 S.E.2d 425,
426 (2009). But the rule of lenity is not a device to create ambiguity,
nor should a court invoke it before considering the words of the statute
in context. *State v. Dawkins,* 352 S.C. 162, 166-67, 573 S.E.2d 783,
785 (2002); *State v. Firemen's Ins. Co. of Newark, N.J.,* 164 S.C. 313,
162 S.E. 334, 338 (1931) ("The rule that a penal statute must be
strictly construed does not prevent the courts from calling to their aid
all the other rules of construction and giving each its appropriate
scope, and is not violated by giving the words of the statute a
reasonable meaning according to the sense in which they were intended,
and disregarding \... even the demands of exact grammatical propriety."
(citation and internal quotations omitted)); *see also United States v.
Bass,* 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (court
should rely on lenity only if, "\[a\]fter 'seizing\] every thing from
which aid can be derived,' " it is "left with an ambiguous statute"
(quoting *United States v. Fisher,* 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 386, 2 L.Ed.
304 (1805) (Marshall, C.J.))).

One of the foundations of the rule of lenity is the concept of fair
notice---the idea that those trying to walk the straight and narrow are
entitled to know where the line is drawn between innocent conduct and
illegality. *McBoyle v. United States,* 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340,
75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) ("\[I\]t is reasonable that a fair warning should be
given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of
what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the
warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear."). The line
for conduct involving contraband is not merely clear but fluorescent. At
least since *State v. Freeland,* 106 S.C. 220, 91 S.E. 3 (1916), we have
required a defendant to know or be willfully ignorant that he was
dealing with contraband drugs to satisfy criminal intent. This removes
innocent activity, inadvertence or accident from the law's grasp. At any
rate, we need not apply the rule of lenity here, as context has
convinced us section 44-53-370(e)(3) does not require proof of knowledge
of the specific identity of the controlled substance. *Carter v. United
States,* 530 U.S. 255, 269, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000)
(courts are required "to read into a statute only that *mens rea* which
is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from 'otherwise innocent
conduct' ").

Another foundation of the rule of lenity is the separation of powers.
Our Constitution commits the task of defining criminal offenses solely
to the Legislative Branch. *Bass,* 404 U.S. at 347-48, 92 S.Ct. 515;
*United States v. Wiltberger,* 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37
(1820). If the Legislature believes our interpretation expands or is
otherwise contrary to the scope it intended section 44-53-370(e)(3) and
its harsh penalty scheme to have, it can amend the statute.

The trial judge's instructions---including his initial charge that
criminal intent consists of "conscious wrongdoing"---conveyed the
pertinent legal standards to the jury. He further correctly charged that
the State still bore the burden of proving the drug quantity and
identity.

1---1 ⅜---i 1---4

Miles next argues he was entitled to a directed verdict because the
State presented insufficient evidence that he knowingly trafficked
oxycodone. As we have held, the State needed only to prove Miles knew
the item was a controlled substance. Because there was evidence Miles
possessed the box, the jury was free to infer he knew what was in it. As
the assistant solicitor pointed out, the evidence was literally lying at
Miles' feet. *See State v. Gore,* 318 S.C. 157, 163, 456 S.E.2d 419, 422
(Ct. App. 1995) ("Possession gives rise to an inference of the
possessor's knowledge of the character of the substance."). Of course,
Miles also admitted he knew the box contained drugs. Viewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the State, these circumstances
go far beyond mere suspicion. There was ample direct and substantial
circumstantial evidence from which Miles' guilt could be fairly and
logically deduced. Rule 19, SCRCrimP; *State v. Odems,* 395 S.C. 582,
586, 720 S.E.2d 48, 50 (2011).

**\[ ... \]**

V.

The trial court did not err in its supplemental instruction to the jury
that the State was only required to prove Miles knowingly trafficked in
a controlled substance. There was sufficient evidence to carry the case
to the jury, and even if the *Miranda* issue was preserved, we find no
prejudice. Miles' conviction is therefore

AFFIRMED.

Supreme Court of the United States

SCDB 1951-028

No. 12

1952-01-07

**\[ ... \]**

Mr. Justice Jackson

delivered the opinion of the Court.

**\[ ... \]**

On a large tract of uninhabited and untilled land in a wooded and
sparsely populated área of Michigan, the Government established a
practice bombing range over which the Air Force dropped simulated bombs
at ground targets. These bombs consisted of a metal cylinder about forty
inches long and eight inches across, filled with sand and enough black
powder to cause a smoke puff by which the strike could be located. At
various places about the range signs read "Danger --- Keep Out---
Bombing Range." Nevertheless, the range was known as good deer country
arid was extensively hunted.

Spent bomb casings were cleared from the targets and thrown into piles
"so that they will be out of the way." They were not stacked or piled in
any order but were dumped in heaps, some of which had been accumulating
for four years or upwards, were exposed to the weather and rusting away.

Morissette, in December of 1948, went hunting in this area but did not
get a deer. He thought to meet expenses of the trip by salvaging some of
these casings. He loaded three tons of them on his truck and took them
to a nearby farm, where they were flattened by driving a tractor over
them. After expending this labor and trucking them to market in Flint,
he realized \$84.

**\[ ... \]**

He was indicted**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**, on the charge that he "did
unlawfully, wilfully and knowingly steal and convert" property of the
United States of the value of. \$84, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 641,
which provides that "whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly
converts" government property is punishable by fine and
imprisonment.[^16] Morissette was convicted and sentenced to
imprisonment for two months or to pay a fine of \$200. The Court of
Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting.[^17]

On his trial, Morissette, as he had at all times told investigating
officers, testified that from appearances he believed the casings were
cast-off and abandoned, that he did not intend to steal the property;
and took it with no wrongful or criminal intent. The trial court,
however, was unimpressed, and ruled: "{H\]e took it because he thought
it was abandoned and he knew he was on government property. . . . That
is no defense. \... I don't think anybody can have the defense they
thought the property was abandoned on another man's piece of property."
The court stated: "I will not permit you to show this man thought it was
abandoned. \... I hold in this case that there is no question of
abandoned property." The court refused to submit or to allow counsel to
argue to the jury whether Morissette acted with innocent intention. It
charged: **\[ ... \]**The question on intent is whether or not he
intended to take the property. He says he did. Therefore, if you believe
either side, he is guilty." Petitioner's counsel contended,"But the
taking must have been with a felonious intent." The court ruled,
however: "That is presumed by his own act."

**\[ ... \]**

The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted
by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universal
and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the
human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to
choose between good and evil.[^18] A relation between some mental
element and punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the
child's familiar exculpatory "But I didn't mean to," and has afforded
the rational basis for a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence
and reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as the motivation
for public\'prosecution.[^19] Unqualified acceptance of this doctrine by
English common law in the Eighteenth Century was indicated by
Black-stoned sweeping statement that to constitute any crime there must
first be a "vicious will." [^20] Common-law commentators of the
Nineteenth Century early pronounced the same principle,[^21] although á
few exceptions not relevant to. our presént problem came to be
recognized.[^22]

Crime,\' as a compound concept, generally constituted only from
concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand, was
congenial to an intense individualism and took deep and early root , in
American soil.[^23] As the states codified the common law of crimes,
even if their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts
assumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle
but merely recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the
offense that it required no statutory affirmation: Courts, with little
hesitation or division, found an implication of the requirement as to
offenses that were taken over from the common law.[^24] *\[The exception
to the rule that crimes require some mens rea is found in \]*

a category of another character, with very different antecedents and
origins. The crimes there involved depend on no mental element but
consist only of forbidden acts or omissions. This, while not expressed
by the Court, is. made clear from examination of a century-old but
accelerating tendency, discernible both here[^25] and in England,[^26]
to call into existence new duties and crimes which disregard any
ingredient of intent. The industrial revolution multiplied the- number
of workmen exposed to injury from increasingly powerful and complex
piechanisms, driven b.y freshly discovered sources of energy, requiring
higher precautions by employers. Traffic of velocities, volumes, and
varieties unheard of came to subject the wayfarer to intolerable
casualty risks if owners and driv- - ers were not to obsérve new cares
and uniformities of conduct. Congestion of cities and crowding of
quarters called for health and welfare regulations undreamed of in
simpler times. Wide distribution of goods became an instrument of wide
distribution of harm when \'those who dispersed food, drink, drugs, and
even securities, did not comply with reasonable standards of quality,
integrity, disclosure and care. \' Such dangers have engendered
increasingly numerous and detailed regulations which heighten the duties
of those in control of particular industries, trades, properties or
activities that affect public health, safety or\^ welfare.

While many of these duties are sanctioned by a more strict civil
liability,[^27] lawmakers, whether wisely or not,[^28] have sought to
make such regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to
be applied by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and
convictions. This has confronted the courts with a multitude of
prosecutions, based on statutes or administrative regulations, for what
have been aptly called "public welfare offenses." These cases do not fit
neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-láw offenses,
such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals.
Many of these offenses are not in .\'the nature of positive aggressions
or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the
nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it
imposes a duty. Many violations of such/regulations result in no direct
or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger
or probability of it which the law se\'eks to minimize. While
such.offenses do not threaten the security of the state in the manner of
treason, they may be regarded as offenses against its authority, for.
their occurrence impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to
the social order as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the
intent of the violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences.are
injurious or not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable\'
to such offenses,- as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a
necessary element. The accused,-if he does not will the violation,
usually is in a position to prevent it with no more care than society
might reasonably expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably
exact from one who assumed his responsibilities. Also, penalties
commonly are relatively small, and conviction does no grave damage to an
offender's reputation. Under such considerations, courts have turned to
construing statutes and regulations which make no mention of intent as
dispensing with it and holding that the guilty act alone makes out the
crime. This has not, however, been without expressions of misgiving.

**\[ ... \]**

The purpose and obvious effect of doing away with the requirement of a
guilty intent is to ease the prosecution's path to conviction, to strip
the defendant of such benefit as he derived at common law from innocence
of evil purpose, and to circumscribe the freedom heretofore allowed
juries. Such a manifest impairment of the immunities of the individual
should not be extended to common-law crimes on judicial initiative. -

The spirit of the doctrine which denies to the federal judiciary power
to create crimes forthrightly[^29] admonishes that we should not enlarge
the reach of enacted crimes by constituting them from anything less than
the incriminating components contemplated by the words used in the
statute. And where Congress borrows terms of art in which are
accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it
presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to
each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and
the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise,
instructed. In such case, absence of. contrary direction may be taken as
satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from
them.

**\[ ... \]**

The section with which we are here concerned was enacted in 1948, as a
consolidation of four former sections of Title 18, as adopted in 1940,
which in turn were derived from two sections of the Revised Statutes.
**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]** Not one of these had been interpreted to be a
crime without intention and no purpose to differentiate between them in
the matter of intent is discloséd. **\[ ... \]**

Congress, by the language of this section, has been at pains to
incriminate only "knowing" conversions. **\[ ... \]**

Had the statute applied to conversions without qualification, it would
have made., crimes of all unwitting, inadvertent and unintended
conversions. Knowledge, of course, is not identical with intent and may
not have been the most apt words of limitation. But knowing conversion
requires more than knowledge that defendant was taking the property into
his possession. He must have had knowledge of the facts, though not
necessarily the law, that made the taking a conversion. **\[ ... \]**

„We find no grounds for inferring any affirmative instruction from
Congress to eliminate intent from any offense with which this defendant
was charged.

In the instant case, we are called upon to decipher the meaning of the
word "suffer," and its analogs, "permit" and "allow." Specifically, we
must decide whether these terms, when used in rules governing the
conduct of holders of a liquor license in Baltimore City, require proof
of knowledge on the part of such licensees.

Appellant, Steven Kougl, owns Club Harem, a Baltimore tavern and adult
entertainment business, and holds a liquor license for that location
issued by appellee, the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for
Baltimore City ("the Liquor Board"). On July 2, 2014, the Liquor Board
charged Kougl with violating three Liquor Board Rules related to
solicitation of prostitution, indecent exposure, and violation of public
morals, all occurring on April 25, 2013, at Club Harem, when an employee
exposed herself to an undercover police officer and then solicited
sexual intercourse from the same officer. The Liquor Board found Kougl
guilty of all three violations and ordered that his liquor license be
suspended for one month. Kougl filed for judicial review in the Circuit
Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the decision of the Liquor
Board.

On appeal to this Court, Kougl raises four questions for our review,
which we have condensed and rephrased as two questions:[^30]

> 1\. Did the Liquor Board make sufficient findings of fact in support
> of the three charged violations of the Liquor Board Rules?
>
> 2\. Did the Liquor Board err in concluding that Kougl was guilty of
> the three violations even though there was no evidence that Kougl had
> knowledge of his employee's behavior?

For reasons set forth herein, we answer both questions in the
affirmative, and thus reverse the judgment of the circuit court and
remand the case to that court for entry of a judgment reversing the
decision of the Liquor Board.

*BACKGROUND*

On April 25, 2013, Detective Fletcher Jackson, a Baltimore City police
officer assigned to the Special Enforcement Section, entered Club Harem
in plain clothes to conduct a prostitution investigation. Jamaica
Brickhouse, a woman who worked at Club Harem, approached Det. Jackson at
the bar and asked if she could join him. Det. Jackson said "sure," and
bought Brickhouse a drink. After some initial conversation, Brickhouse
exposed her breasts to Det. Jackson. Brickhouse invited Det. Jackson to
touch her breasts, which he did. Brickhouse then suggested a lap dance
or a trip to "the VIP," where they could "do whatever up there." Det.
Jackson asked how much it would cost him to have sex with Brickhouse;
Brickhouse replied that it would cost \$170 "for the room," plus a tip
for her services. Det. Jackson said that he could tip \$100, and
Brickhouse agreed. Brickhouse returned to the stage to perform, and Det.
Jackson notified other officers. **\[ ... \]**

Fifteen months after the incident, on July 2, 2014, the Liquor Board
charged Kougl with violating three Liquor Board Rules related to
solicitation of prostitution in violation of Rule 4.17(a), indecent
exposure in violation of Rule 4.17(b), and violation of public morals in
violation of Rule 4.18. On July 17, 2014, the Liquor Board held a
hearing on the charges against Kougl. Det. Jackson was the only witness
for the prosecution; Kougl testified in his own defense. The Liquor
Board voted 2-1 that Kougl was guilty of the three violations[^31] and
suspended his liquor license for one month.

On July 18, 2014, Kougl filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the
circuit court. On March 2, 2015, Kougl filed his Memorandum, in which he
argued that (1) the Liquor Board's decision was not based on substantial
evidence, because "\[t\]here \[wa\]s nothing in \[Det. Jackson's\]
testimony to indicate that the \[licensee knew, allowed or permitted
this type of activity, which is needed to sustain the violations"; (2)
its decision was unreasonable and arbitrary, because the Chairman of the
Liquor Board stated that a licensee "would be responsible for actions of
an employee" regardless of "whether the \[licensee knew or did not know
or allowed or did not allow or permitted or did not permit" the
prohibited activity**\[ ... \]**. On April 15, 2015, the Liquor Board
filed its Response to Kougl's Memorandum, in which it contended that (1)
its decision was based on substantial evidence; (2) its decision was
reasonable**\[ ... \]**.

On May 22, 2015, the circuit court held oral argument and issued an oral
ruling affirming the decision of the Liquor Board. On May 28, 2015, the
court entered its order affirming the Liquor Board's decision. On June
22, 2015, Kougl filed a timely notice of appeal.

*STANDARD OF REVIEW*

Maryland law provides by statute that the action of a local liquor board
is presumed to be proper and places the burden of proof upon the
licensee to show that the decision complained of was arbitrary,
fraudulent, unsupported by substantial evidence, illegal, or against the
public interest. Md.Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol), Art. 2B, § 16 ---
101(e)(l)(i). **\[ ... \]**

*DISCUSSION*

I.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

II\.

Strict Liability

Kougl argues that Rules 4.17 and 4.18 require some evidence or inference
therefrom that Kougl suffered, permitted, or allowed solicitation and
nudity to occur, and there was no evidence to support such a finding.
According to Kougl, there was insufficient evidence for the Liquor Board
to infer that Kougl permitted such conduct to occur "merely by reason
that the dancer solicited the detective."

The Liquor Board responds that the three violations "are, as a matter of
law, strict liability offenses," none of which require "a licensee's
knowledge of the impermissible conduct." The Liquor Board analogizes
Rules 4.17(a) and (b) to Rule 4.01(a), which prohibits sales of alcohol
to minors, to argue that both Rules "contain\[\] both a strict liability
prohibition and a second provision with a knowledge requirement." As for
Rule 4.18, the Liquor Board argues that it "contains no knowledge or
mens rea language. Therefore, it describes a strict liability offense."
According to the Liquor Board, Kougl was found guilty of violating the
strict liability portion of the Rules.

By virtue of its argument that the charged violations are strict
liability offenses, the Liquor Board concedes that the evidence adduced
at the hearing was insufficient to find that Kougl had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violations. Upon review of the record, we
agree that there was simply no evidence of Kougl's actual or
constructive knowledge of the violations.

Whether Rules 4.17 and 4.18 impose a strict liability standard on a
licensee depends on the meaning of the words "suffer," "permit," and
"allow" as used in the Rules. In determining the meaning of such words,
"we apply well-settled rules of statutory construction, the cardinal
rule of \[which\] is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the
Legislature." *Assateague Coastkeeper v. Md. Dep't of Env't,* 200
Md.App. 665, 708-09, 28 A.3d 178 (2011) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted).

(2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

In accord with the above standard, we turn to the plain meaning of the
subject terms in the Rules. Black's Law Dictionary defines "suffer" as:

> To allow, to admit, or to permit. It includes knowledge of what is to
> be done under sufferance. To suffer an act to be done or a condition
> to exist is to permit or consent to it; to approve of it, and not to
> hinder it. It implies knowledge, a willingness of the mind and
> responsible control or ability to prevent.

*Black's Law Dictionary* 1432 (6th ed.1990) (emphasis added) (citations
omitted). "Permit" is defined as: "To suffer, allow, consent, let; to
give leave or license; to acquiesce, by failure to prevent, or to
expressly assent or agree to the doing of an act." *Id.* at 1140.
Finally, Black's Law Dictionary defines "allow" as:

> The word has no rigid or precise meaning, its import varying according
> to circumstances or context in connection with which it is used. It
> may mean to bestow or assign to any one as his right or due. To
> approve of, accept as true, admit, concede, adopt, or fix. To grant
> something as a deduction or an addition; to abate or deduct; as, to
> allow a sum for leakage. To sanction, either directly or indirectly,
> as opposed to merely suffering a thing to be done; to acquiesce in; to
> suffer; to tolerate.

*Id.* at 76 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).

No Maryland appellate opinion exists regarding the meaning of these
words in the context of the Liquor Board Rules. Other jurisdictions that
use "suffer," "permit," or "allow," in their liquor board rules are
divided on whether such terms impose a strict liability standard, or
whether knowledge on the part of the licensee must be proven.

Wisconsin, Oregon, and New Jersey courts have held that their states'
liquor board rules, all of which use the words "suffer," "permit," or
"allow," impose strict liability on the part of the licensee. In *City
of West Allis v. Megna,* the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that an
ordinance that stated that no licensee shall "either directly or
indirectly suffer or permit any person of either sex under the age of 21
years \... to enter or be on such licensed premises for any purpose,"
imposed a strict liability standard. 26 Wis.2d 545, 133 N.W.2d 252, 253
(1965). The Court determined that "\[p\]roof of knowledge on the part of
the tavern keeper that the patron is actually under age is not required
by the statute in order to obtain a conviction," and that such standard
"is a price that the operator pays for the privilege of becoming
licensed." *Id.* at 254.

Similarly, the Court of Appeals of Oregon held in *DK Entertainment, LLC
v. Oregon Liquor Control Commission* that, when interpreting an
ordinance stating that " '\[n\]o licensee or permittee will permit any
unlawful activity on the licensed premises or in areas the licensee
controls that are adjacent to or outside the premises,' " the Oregon
Liquor Control Commission "may impute to the licensee the knowledge of
the licensees employees." 249 Or.App. 659, 278 P.3d 112, 113 n. 2, 114
(2012). Finally, in *Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Maynards
Inc.,* the Supreme Court of New Jersey held an ordinance providing that
"\[n\]o licensee shall allow, permit or suffer in or upon the licensed
premises any unlawful possession of or any unlawful activity pertaining
to" narcotics and other controlled dangerous substances imposed a strict
liability standard. 192 N.J. 158, 927 A.2d 525, 536 (2007). The Court
noted that "\[i\]t has long been the law in New Jersey that, in the
context of the regulation of alcoholic beverages, 'the word suffer \...
imposes responsibility on a licensee, *regardless of knowledge,* where
there is a failure to prevent the prohibited conduct by those occupying
the premises with his authority.' " *Id.* at 538 (ellipses and italics
in original).

Conversely, other courts, such as those in Colorado, California, New
York, and Washington, have held that the terms "suffer," "permit," or
"allow" require actual or constructive knowledge. In *Full Moon Saloon,
Inc. v. City of Loveland,* the Colorado Court of Appeals held that a
statute making it unlawful to, among other things, "permit the sale,
serving, giving, or procuring of any alcohol beverage to or for a person
under the age of twenty-one years" required that "some level of
knowledge by the licensee must be established by the evidence." Ill P.3d
568, 569-70 (Colo.App.2005). The Court explained:

> The word "permit" connotes affirmative or knowing conduct. Thus,
> licensees and their employees and agents "permit" such conduct if they
> have actual knowledge of the violation or have constructive knowledge
> that it is occurring.
>
> Our conclusion that constructive knowledge of liquor code violations
> is sufficient to hold a licensee responsible for permitting the
> violation is consistent with cases from other jurisdictions. *See
> Spitz v. Mun. Court,* 127 Ariz. 405, 621 P.2d 911 (1980) (licensee is
> deemed to have constructive knowledge of the age of underage buyer if
> licensee provides alcohol to the minor and fails to follow certain
> procedures); *Laube v. Stroh,* 2 Cal.App.4th 364, 3 Cal.Rptr.2d 779
> (1992) (to suspend liquor license, evidence must be presented that
> licensee had either actual or constructive knowledge of activity);
> *Pinacoteca Corp. v. Dep't of Bus. Regulation,* 580 So.2d 881
> (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.\[4th DCA\]1991) (where activity is persistent and
> recurring, licensee's knowledge of the activity may be inferred);
> *State v. Engberg,* 109 Idaho 530, 708 P.2d 935 (Ct.App.1985)
> (violation may be found if licensee had constructive knowledge of the
> prohibited activity); *Town & Country Lanes, Inc. v. Liquor Control
> Comm'n,* 179 Mich.App. 649, 446 N.W.2d 335 (1989) (licensee violated
> liquor license rule by failing to exercise reasonable diligence to
> ascertain the age of underage customer); *Leake v. Sarafan,* 35 N.Y.2d
> 83, 358 N.Y.S.2d 749, 315 N.E.2d 796 (1974) (to sustain a violation,
> licensee must have knowledge of the activity or the opportunity
> through reasonable diligence to acquire knowledge of the alleged
> acts); *Smith v. Bd. of Liquor Control,* 96 Ohio App. 396, 121 N.E.2d
> 920 (1954) (licensee must have actual or constructive knowledge of
> prohibited activity) *Tex. Alcoholic Beverage Comm'n v. Sanchez,* 96
> S.W.3d 483 (Tex.App.2002) (to suspend liquor license, evidence must be
> presented that licensee had either actual or constructive knowledge of
> activity); *Reeb, Inc. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd.,* 24
> Wash.App. 349, 600 P.2d 578 (1979) (to "permit" a violation, licensee
> must have actual or constructive knowledge of the activity).

*Id.* at 570-71 (emphasis added).

Similarly, in *Laube v. Stroh,* the Court of Appeal of California
"h\[e\]ld that a licensee must have knowledge, either actual or
constructive, before he or she can be found to have 'permitted'
unacceptable conduct on a licensed premises." 2 Cal.App.4th 364, 3
Cal.Rptr.2d 779, 788 (1992). The Court continued: "It defies logic to
charge someone with permitting conduct of which they are not aware."
*Id.* Finally, the Court noted that "\[failure to prevent the problem
from recurring, once the licensee knows of it, is to 'permit' by a
failure to take preventive action." *Id.* at 789.

Likewise, in *Leake,* the Court of Appeals of New York noted the
following regarding the statutory words "suffer" or "permit":

> There is no particular mystery or magic in the language of the
> statute. This court in *Matter of Migliaccio v. O'Connell* \[307 N.Y.
> 566, 122 N.E.2d 914 (1955)\] defined the intent of the statute when it
> stated that in considering what is implied by the phrase suffer or
> permit as employed in the statute quoted above, we are guided by what
> was written for this court (per Cardozo, J.) in *People ex rel Price
> v. Sheffield Farms* \[225 N.Y. 25, 121 N.E. 474 (1918) \]: Sufferance
> as here prohibited implies knowledge or the opportunity through
> reasonable diligence to acquire knowledge. This presupposes in most
> cases a fair measure at least of continuity and permanence.

358 N.Y.S.2d 749, 315 N.E.2d at 797 (emphasis added) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted).

> Finally, in *Reeb,* the Court of Appeals of Washington held: The word
> "permit" as used in the regulation does not imply that the licensee
> must have permanently sanctioned the prohibited act; it refers to the
> licensee's actual or constructive knowledge of the circumstances which
> would foreseeably lead to the prohibited activity. Reeb was aware of
> the propensity of its dancers to engage in questionable conduct and
> chose nevertheless to maintain topless dancing on its licensed
> premises. Under these circumstances, the Board could find that Reeb
> permitted the conduct in violation of \[the Liquor Board Rules\]. This
> violation is sufficient to support the 7-day license suspension
> imposed by the Board.

600 P.2d at 581 (citation omitted).

Considering the plain meaning of the words "suffer," "permit," and
"allow," we conclude that the use of those words in Rules 4.17 and 4.18
necessarily require that "some level of knowledge by the licensee must
be established by the evidence." *Full Moon Saloon,* 111 P.3d at 569. As
indicated above, the definition of "suffer" expressly states that
"\[i\]t includes knowledge of what is to be done under sufferance."
*Black's Law Dictionary* at 1432. The terms "permit" and "allow" also
imply knowledge of what is to be permitted or allowed. *See First Nat'l
Bank & Trust Co. of Port Chester v. New York Title Ins. Co.,* 171 Misc.
854, 12 N.Y.S.2d 703, 709 (1939) ("It has been said that every
definition of 'suffer' and 'permit' includes knowledge of what is to be
done under the sufferance and permission, and intention that what is
done is to be done.").

We are fully cognizant of the strong public policy considerations behind
requiring a strict liability standard in the Liquor Board Rules.
Unlawful or immoral activities may be associated with places where
alcoholic beverages are sold. However, one of the primary purposes of
the Liquor Board Rules is to clearly inform licensees of their
responsibilities regarding prohibited activities so that they can
conform their conduct and the conduct of their businesses to be in
compliance with the Rules. Interpreting the words used in the Liquor
Board Rules at variance with their plain meaning does not advance the
public purpose of achieving compliance with the Rules. Although we are
obligated to give deference to the Liquor Board's interpretation of its
Rules, *see Noland,* 386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145, "\[a\]n agency
conclusion will not be upheld upon review, however, if based upon an
error of law," *Hoyle,* 115 Md.App. at 129, 692 A.2d 1. Accordingly, we
hold that the Liquor Board erred in interpreting the words "suffer,"
"permit," and "allow" in Rules 4.17 and 4.18 to impose a strict
liability standard on licensees.[^32]

We also hold that the knowledge requirement implicit in the terms
"suffer," "permit," and "allow" can be satisfied by proof of either
actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the licensee. *See Full
Moon Saloon,* 111 P.3d at 570. Actual knowledge is, of course, actual
awareness of the prohibited activity. Actual knowledge also includes the
concept of "deliberate ignorance" or "willful blindness." *See Rice v.
State,* 136 Md.App. 593, 604, 766 A.2d 663 (2001). In *State v.
McCallum,* Judge Chasanow explained the meaning of this form of
knowledge in a concurring opinion:

> There is more than one mental state that may constitute "knowledge."
> The first and highest form of "knowledge" is actual knowledge, that
> is, an actual awareness or an actual belief that a fact exists. A
> second form of "knowledge" is what has often been called "deliberate
> ignorance" or "willful blindness." R. Perkins, *Criminal Law,* Ch. 7,
> § 4 at 687 (1957). The latter form of "knowledge" exists where a
> person believes that it is probable that something is a fact, but
> deliberately shuts his or her eyes or avoids making reasonable inquiry
> with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth. *See* 1 W.
> LaFave & A. Scott, *Substantive Criminal Law,* § 3.5 at 307 (1986),
> and authorities cited therein. In *United States v. Jewell,* 532 F.2d
> 697 (9th Cir.), *cert. denied,* 426 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 3173, 49
> L.Ed.2d 1188 (1976), the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the
> deliberate ignorance or willful blindness form of knowledge has been
> accepted by leading commentators in the United States and in England.
> The opinion quoted from Professor Glanville Williams' *Criminal Law:
> The General Part,* § 57 at 157, 159 (2d ed.1961), as follows:
>
> "To the requirement of actual knowledge there is one strictly limited
> exception\.... \[T\]he rule is that if a party has his suspicion
> aroused but then deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because
> he wishes to remain in ignorance, he is deemed to have
> knowledge\_\_\_\_The rule that wilful blindness is equivalent to
> knowledge is essential, and is found throughout the criminal law."

*Id.* at 700.

321 Md. 451, 458-59, 583 A.2d 250 (1991) (Chasanow, J., concurring)
(emphasis added).

Constructive knowledge, however, implies knowledge where a licensee
should have known of the prohibited activity if reasonable care and
diligence had been exercised. *See Leake,* 358 N.Y.S.2d 749, 315 N.E.2d
at 797 (stating that "it must be demonstrated that the licensee had
knowledge or the opportunity through reasonable diligence to acquire
knowledge of the alleged acts"); *Morgan v. Bd. of Water Works of
Pueblo,* 837 P.2d 300, 303 (Colo.App.1992) (stating that, if in the
exercise of ordinary diligence a party should have known a fact, it will
be deemed to have knowledge).

The Colorado Court of Appeals explained constructive knowledge as
follows:

> Constructive knowledge may be inferred if the conduct occurs openly,
> such that a reasonable person would observe it. If knowledge of the
> prohibited conduct could have been obtained through the exercise of
> reasonable care and diligence, constructive knowledge may be inferred.
>
> Applying a constructive knowledge standard does not place an undue
> burden on the licensee because constructive knowledge requires only
> reasonable care and diligence and does not require extraordinary
> vigilance. Constructive knowledge means knowledge that one using
> reasonable care or diligence should have, and therefore that is
> attributed by law to a given person.

*Full Moon Saloon,* 111 P.3d at 570 (citations and internal quotation
marks omitted).

Nevertheless, the Liquor Board argues that Rule 4.17 is similar to Rule
4.01(a), which we held in *Hoyle* to impose strict liability. We
disagree.

Rule 4.01(a) provides: "No licensee shall sell or furnish alcoholic
beverages to any person under twenty-one (21) years of age or to any
person with the knowledge that such person is purchasing or acquiring
such beverages for consumption by any person under twenty-one (21) years
of age." *Hoyle,* 115 Md.App. at 130, 692 A.2d 1. In *Hoyle,* the Liquor
Board ruled that Martini's Bar had violated Rule 4.01(a) when one of its
employees served alcohol to a minor. *Id.* at 128, 692 A.2d 1. Martini's
Bar appealed, arguing that this Court "should read a 'due caution'
provision into the \[R\]ule." *Id.* at 131, 692 A.2d 1. We declined to
do so, and instead held that the Rule "imposes strict liability for the
sale on the licensees." *Id.* at 133, 692 A.2d 1.

Our holding in *Hoyle* is clearly distinguishable from our holding in
the case *sub judice.* Rule 4.01(a), unlike Rule 4.17, does not use the
words "suffer," "permit," or "allow," which, as explained above,
necessarily include an element of knowledge. Instead, Rule 4.01(a) sets
forth a simple directive --- "No licensee shall sell or furnish \....",
which carries no implication of knowledge.

Finally, because the word "knowingly" appears in the second independent
clause ("second clause"), and not in the first independent clause
("first clause"), of Rule 4.17(b), the Liquor Board claims that such
sentence construction necessarily implies a strict liability standard in
the first clause. Again, we disagree.

To reiterate, Rule 4.17(b) states:

> No licensee shall permit or suffer any person to appear in any act or
> other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered; nor shall
> any licensee knowingly permit or suffer his premises to be used for
> the conduct, exhibition or performance of an obscene act or other
> performance.

The first clause clearly identifies the prohibited act --- any person
"appearing\] \... with breasts or the lower torso uncovered." On the
other hand, the second clause prohibits the performance of an "obscene
act or other performance." In our view, the word "knowingly" appears in
the second clause because an element of knowledge is required to
constitutionally regulate obscenity, a class of unprotected speech that
is not clearly defined in First Amendment jurisprudence. *See generally
Miller v. California,* 413 U.S. 15, 20, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419
(1973) (summarizing "the somewhat tortured history of the Court's
obscenity decisions").

Accordingly, we hold that the Liquor Board erred in finding that Kougl
was guilty of violating Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), and 4.18, because there
was no evidence that Kougl had actual or constructive knowledge of his
employee's prohibited activity.

JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED
TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER A JUDGMENT REVERSING THE
DECISION OF THE LIQUOR BOARD RENDERED ON JULY 17, 2014. COSTS TO BE PAID
BY APPELLEE.

**^\[4\]^**4. The Alcoholic Beverages Rules and Regulations for the
Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City were updated in
2015 and effective as of January 1, 2016. The new rules that correspond
to old rules 4.17 and 4.18 are:

> Rule 4.15 --- Sexual Practices and Obscenity
>
> \(a\) A licensee may not permit the licensed premises to be used for
> any sexual activity. A licensee, any employee, patron or frequenter
> may not solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.
>
> \(b\) A licensee may not permit a person to appear in an act or other
> performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered. A licensee may
> not knowingly permit the licensed premises to be used for the conduct,
> exhibition, or any unlawful performance.
>
> \(c\) Section (b) of this rule does not apply to licensees that have a
> valid adult entertainment license issued by this Board.
>
> Rule 4.16 --- Illegal Conduct
>
> A licensee may not commit or allow the commission on the licensed
> premises of an act that is contrary to any federal, State or local
> statute, law or ordinance or that is against the public peace, safety,
> health, welfare, quiet, or morals.

The prior version of Rule 4.17 did not contain a subsection (c)
exempting the application of the Rule to licensees with a valid adult
entertainment license. There is nothing in the record, nor do the
parties contend, that Kougl held a valid adult entertainment license for
Club Harem at the time of the violations.

## Justice Breyer, delivered the opinion of the Court.

A provision in the firearms chapter of the federal criminal code imposes
a 5-year mandatory prison term upon a person who \"uses or carries a
firearm\" \"during and in relation to\" a \"drug trafficking crime.\" 18
U. S. C. § 924(c)(1). The question before us is whether the phrase
\"carries a firearm\" is limited to the carrying of firearms on the
person. We hold that it is not so limited. Rather, it also applies to a
person \[127\] who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a
vehicle, including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car,
which the person accompanies.

## I

The question arises in two cases, which we have consolidated for
argument. Petitioner in the first case, Frank J. Muscarello, unlawfully
sold marijuana, which he carried in his truck to the place of sale.
Police officers found a handgun locked in the truck\'s glove
compartment. During plea proceedings, Muscarello admitted that he had
\"carried\" the gun \"for protection in relation\" to the drug offense,
App. in No. 96-1654, p. 12, though he later claimed to the contrary, and
added that, in any event, his \"carr\[ying\]\" of the gun in the glove
compartment did not fall within the scope of the statutory word
\"carries.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-1654, p. 10a.

Petitioners in the second case, Donald Cleveland and Enrique
Gray-Santana, placed several guns in a bag, put the bag in the trunk of
a car, and then traveled by car to a proposed drug-sale point, where
they intended to steal drugs from the sellers. Federal agents at the
scene stopped them, searched the cars, found the guns and drugs, and
arrested them.

In both cases the Courts of Appeals found that petitioners had
\"carrie\[d\]\" the guns during and in relation to a drug trafficking
offense. 106 F. 3d 636, 639 (CA5 1997); 106 F. 3d 1056, 1068 (CA1 1997).
We granted certiorari to determine whether the fact that the guns were
found in the locked glove compartment, or the trunk, of a car precludes
application of § 924(c)(1). We conclude that it does not.

## II

## A

We begin with the statute\'s language. The parties vigorously contest
the ordinary English meaning of the phrase \[128\] \"carries a
firearm.\" Because they essentially agree that Congress intended the
phrase to convey its ordinary, and not some special legal, meaning, and
because they argue the linguistic point at length, we too have looked
into the matter in more than usual depth. Although the word \"carry\"
has many different meanings, only two are relevant here. When one uses
the word in the first, or primary, meaning, one can, as a matter of
ordinary English, \"carry firearms\" in a wagon, car, truck, or other
vehicle that one accompanies. When one uses the word in a different,
rather special, way, to mean, for example, \"bearing\" or (in slang)
\"packing\" (as in \"packing a gun\"), the matter is less clear. But,
for reasons we shall set out below, we believe Congress intended to use
the word in its primary sense and not in this latter, special way.

Consider first the word\'s primary meaning. The Oxford English
Dictionary gives as its *first* definition \"convey, originally by cart
or wagon, hence in any vehicle, by ship, on horseback, etc.\" 2 Oxford
English Dictionary 919 (2d ed. 1989); see also Webster\'s Third New
International Dictionary 343 (1986) (*first* definition: \"move while
supporting (*as in a vehicle* or in one\'s hands or arms)\"); Random
House Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 319 (2d ed. 1987)
(*first* definition: \"to take or support from one place to another;
convey; transport\").

The origin of the word \"carries\" explains why the first, or basic,
meaning of the word \"carry\" includes conveyance in a vehicle. See
Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology 146 (1988) (tracing the word from Latin
\"carum,\" which means \"car\" or \"cart\"); 2 Oxford English
Dictionary, *supra,* at 919 (tracing the word from Old French \"carier\"
and the late Latin \"carricare,\" which meant to \"convey in a car\");
Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology 148 (C. Onions ed. 1966) (same);
Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, *supra,* at 143 (explaining that the
term \"car\" has been used to refer to the automobile since 1896).

\[129\] The greatest of writers have used the word with this meaning.
See, *e. g.,* The King James Bible, 2 Kings 9:28 (\"\[H\]is servants
carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem\"); *id.,* Isaiah 30:6 (\"\[T\]hey
will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses\"). Robinson
Crusoe says, \"\[w\]ith my boat, I carry\'d away every Thing.\" D.
Defoe, Robinson Crusoe 174 (J. Crowley ed. 1972). And the owners of
Queequeg\'s ship, Melville writes, \"had lent him a \[wheelbarrow\], in
which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding-house.\" H. Melville,
Moby Dick 43 (U. Chicago 1952). This Court, too, has spoken of the
\"carrying\" of drugs in a car or in its \"trunk.\" *California* v.
*Acevedo,* 500 U. S. 565, 572-573 (1991); *Florida* v. *Jimeno,* 500 U.
S. 248, 249 (1991).

These examples do not speak directly about carrying guns. But there is
nothing linguistically special about the fact that weapons, rather than
drugs, are being carried. Robinson Crusoe might have carried a gun in
his boat; Queequeg might have borrowed a wheelbarrow in which to carry
not a chest but a harpoon. And, to make certain that there is no special
ordinary English restriction (unmentioned in dictionaries) upon the use
of \"carry\" in respect to guns, we have surveyed modern press usage,
albeit crudely, by searching computerized newspaper data bases---both
the New York Times data base in Lexis/Nexis, and the \"US News\" data
base in Westlaw. We looked for sentences in which the words \"carry,\"
\"vehicle,\" and \"weapon\" (or variations thereof) all appear. We found
thousands of such sentences, and random sampling suggests that many,
perhaps more than one-third, are sentences used to convey the meaning at
issue here, *i. e.,* the carrying of guns in a car.

The New York Times, for example, writes about \"an ex-con\" who
\"arrives home driving a stolen car and carrying a load of handguns,\"
Mar. 21, 1992, section 1, p. 18, col. 1, and an \"official peace officer
who carries a shotgun in his boat,\" June 19, 1988, section 12WC, p. 2,
col. 1; cf. The New York \[130\] Times Manual of Style and Usage, a Desk
Book of Guidelines for Writers and Editors, foreword (L. Jordan rev. ed.
1976) (restricting Times journalists and editors to the use of proper
English). The Boston Globe refers to the arrest of a professional
baseball player \"for carrying a semiloaded automatic weapon in his
car.\" Dec. 10, 1994, p. 75, col. 5. The Colorado Springs Gazette
Telegraph speaks of one \"Russell\" who \"carries a gun hidden in his
car.\" May 2,1993, p. B1, col. 2. The Arkansas Gazette refers to a
\"house\" that was \"searched\" in an effort to find \"items that could
be carried in a car, such as . . . guns.\"Mar. 10, 1991, p. A1, col. 2.
The San Diego Union-Tribune asks, \"What, do they carry guns aboard
these boats now?\" Feb. 18, 1992, p.D2, col. 5.

Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word
\"carry\"---a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners
and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English Dictionary\'s
*twenty-sixth* definition of \"carry\" is \"bear, wear, hold up, or
sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.\" 2
Oxford English Dictionary, at 921. Webster\'s defines \"carry\" as \"to
move while supporting,\" not just in a vehicle, but also \"in one\'s
hands or arms.\" Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary, *supra,*
at 343. And Black\'s Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase \"carry
arms or weapons\" as

> \"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in
> a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed
> and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with
> another person.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).

These special definitions, however, do not purport to *limit* the
\"carrying of arms\" to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts
that one who bears arms on his person \"carries a weapon.\" But to say
that is not to deny that one may *also* \"carry a weapon\" tied to the
saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.

\[131\] Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress
intended to limit the word \"carries\" in the statute to any of these
special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions
embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of \"carry,\" a
meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as
when, for example, a column \"carries\" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford
English Dictionary, at 919, 921. In this sense a gangster might
\"carry\" a gun (in colloquial language, he might \"pack a gun\") even
though he does not move from his chair. It is difficult to believe,
however, that Congress intended to limit the statutory word to this
definition---imposing special punishment upon the comatose gangster
while ignoring drug lords who drive to a sale carrying an arsenal of
weapons in their van.

We recognize, as the dissent emphasizes, that the word \"carry\" has
other meanings as well. But those other meanings (*e. g.,* \"carry all
he knew,\" \"carries no colours\"), see *post,* at 143-144, are not
relevant here. And the fact that speakers often do *not* add to the
phrase \"carry a gun\" the words \"in a car\" is of no greater relevance
here than the fact that millions of Americans did *not* see Muscarello
carry a gun in his truck. The relevant linguistic facts are that the
word \"carry\" in its ordinary sense includes carrying in a car and that
the word, used in its ordinary sense, keeps the same meaning whether one
carries a gun, a suitcase, or a banana.

Given the ordinary meaning of the word \"carry,\" it is not surprising
to find that the Federal Courts of Appeals have unanimously concluded
that \"carry\" is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the
person but can include their carriage in a car. *United States* v.
*Toms,* 136 F. 3d 176, 181 (CADC 1998); *United States* v. *Foster,* 133
F. 3d 704, 708 (CA9 1998); *United States* v. *Eyer,* 113 F. 3d 470, 476
(CA3 1997); 106 F. 3d, at 1066 (case below); 106 F. 3d, at 639 (case
below); *United States* v. *Malcuit,* 104 F. 3d 880, 885, rehearing en
banc granted, 116 F. 3d 163 (CA6 1997); *United States* v. *Mitchell,*
104 F. 3d 649, 653-654 (CA4 1997); *United* \[132\] *States* v.
*Molina,* 102 F. 3d 928, 932 (CA7 1996); *United States* v. *Willis,* 89
F. 3d 1371, 1379 (CA8 1996); *United States* v. *Miller,* 84 F. 3d 1244,
1259-1260 (1996), overruled on other grounds, *United States* v.
*Holland,* 116 F. 3d 1353 (CA10 1997); *United States* v. *Giraldo,* 80
F. 3d 667, 676-677 (CA2 1996); *United States* v. *Farris,* 77 F. 3d
391, 395-396 (CA11 1996).

## B

We now explore more deeply the purely legal question of whether Congress
intended to use the word \"carry\" in its ordinary sense, or whether it
intended to limit the scope of the phrase to instances in which a gun is
carried \"on the person.\" We conclude that neither the statute\'s basic
purpose nor its legislative history support circumscribing the scope of
the word \"carry\" by applying an \"on the person\" limitation.

This Court has described the statute\'s basic purpose broadly, as an
effort to combat the \"dangerous combination\" of \"drugs and guns.\"
*Smith* v. *United States,* 508 U. S. 223, 240 (1993). And the
provision\'s chief legislative sponsor has said that the provision seeks
\"to persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave
his gun at home.\" 114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (1968) (Rep. Poff); see *Busic*
v. *United States,* 446 U. S. 398, 405 (1980) (describing Poff\'s
comments as \"crucial material\" in interpreting the purpose of §
924(c)); *Simpson* v. *United States,* 435 U. S. 6, 13-14 (1978)
(concluding that Poff\'s comments are \"clearly probative\" and
\"certainly entitled to weight\"); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 22243-22244
(statutes would apply to \"the man who goes out taking a gun to commit a
crime\") (Rep. Hunt); *id.,* at 22244 (\"Of course, what we are trying
to do by these penalties is to persuade the criminal to leave his gun at
home\") (Rep. Randall); *id.* , at 22236 (\"We are concerned . . . with
having the criminal leave his gun at home\") (Rep. Meskill).

From the perspective of any such purpose (persuading a criminal \"to
leave his gun at home\"), what sense would it \[133\] make for this
statute to penalize one who walks with a gun in a bag to the site of a
drug sale, but to ignore a similar individual who, like defendant
Gray-Santana, travels to a similar site with a similar gun in a similar
bag, but instead of walking, drives there with the gun in his car? How
persuasive is a punishment that is without effect until a drug dealer
who has brought his gun to a sale (indeed has it available for use)
actually takes it from the trunk (or unlocks the glove compartment) of
his car? It is difficult to say that, considered as a class, those who
prepare, say, to sell drugs by placing guns in their cars are less
dangerous, or less deserving of punishment, than those who carry
handguns on their person.

We have found no significant indication elsewhere in the legislative
history of any more narrowly focused relevant purpose. We have found an
instance in which a legislator referred to the statute as applicable
when an individual \"has a firearm on his person,\" *ibid.* (Rep.
Meskill); an instance in which a legislator speaks of \"a criminal who
takes a gun in his hand,\" *id.* , at 22239 (Rep. Pucinski); and a
reference in the Senate Report to a \"gun carried in a pocket,\" S. Rep.
No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1983); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 21788, 21789
(1968) (references to gun \"carrying\" without more). But in these
instances no one purports to define the scope of the term \"carries\";
and the examples of guns carried on the person are not used to
illustrate the reach of the term \"carries\" but to illustrate, or to
criticize, a different aspect of the statute.

Regardless, in other instances, legislators suggest that the word
\"carries\" has a broader scope. One legislator indicates that the
statute responds in part to the concerns of law enforcement personnel,
who had urged that \"carrying short firearms in motor vehicles be
classified as carrying such weapons concealed.\" *Id.,* at 22242 (Rep.
May). Another criticizes a version of the proposed statute by suggesting
it might apply to drunken driving, and gives as an example a \[134\]
drunken driver who has a \"gun in his car.\" *Id.,* at 21792 (Rep.
Yates). Others describe the statute as criminalizing gun
\"possession\"---a term that could stretch beyond both the \"use\" of a
gun and the carrying of a gun on the person. See *id.,* at 21793 (Rep.
Casey); *id.,* at 22236 (Rep. Meskill); *id.,* at 30584 (Rep. Collier);
*id.,* at 30585 (Rep. Skubitz).

## C

We are not convinced by petitioners\' remaining arguments to the
contrary. First, they say that our definition of \"carry\" makes it the
equivalent of \"transport.\" Yet, Congress elsewhere in related statutes
used the word \"transport\" deliberately to signify a different, and
broader, statutory coverage. The immediately preceding statutory
subsection, for example, imposes a different set of penalties on one
who, with an intent to commit a crime, \"ships, transports, or receives
a firearm\" in interstate commerce. 18 U. S. C. § 924(b). Moreover, §
926A specifically \"entitle\[s\]\" a person \"not otherwise prohibited .
. . from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm\" to \"transport
a firearm . . . from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry\"
it to \"any other place\" where he may do so. Why, petitioners ask,
would Congress have used the word \"transport,\" or used both \"carry\"
and \"transport\" in the same provision, if it had intended to
obliterate the distinction between the two?

The short answer is that our definition does not equate \"carry\" and
\"transport.\" \"Carry\" implies personal agency and some degree of
possession, whereas \"transport\" does not have such a limited
connotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods in bulk over
great distances. See Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary, at
343 (noting that \"carry\" means \"moving to a location some distance
away while supporting or maintaining off the ground\" and \"is a natural
word to use in ref. to cargoes and loads on trucks, wagons, planes,
ships, or even beasts of burden,\" while \"transport refers to carriage
in bulk or number over an appreciable \[135\] distance and, typically,
by a customary or usual carrier agency\"); see also Webster\'s
Dictionary of Synonyms 141 (1942). If Smith, for example, calls a parcel
delivery service, which sends a truck to Smith\'s house to pick up
Smith\'s package and take it to Los Angeles, one might say that Smith
has shipped the package and the parcel delivery service has transported
the package. But only the truck driver has \"carried\" the package in
the sense of \"carry\" that we believe Congress intended. Therefore,
\"transport\" is a broader category that includes \"carry\" but also
encompasses other activity.

The dissent refers to § 926A and to another statute where Congress used
the word \"transport\" rather than \"carry\" to describe the movement of
firearms. 18 U. S. C. § 925(a) (2)(B); *post,* at 146-147. According to
the dissent, had Congress intended \"carry\" to have the meaning we give
it, Congress would not have needed to use a different word in these
provisions. But as we have discussed above, we believe the word
\"transport\" is broader than the word \"carry.\"

And, if Congress intended \"carry\" to have the limited definition the
dissent contends, it would have been quite unnecessary to add the
proviso in § 926A requiring a person, to be exempt from penalties, to
store her firearm in a locked container not immediately accessible. See
§ 926A (quoted in full, *post,* at 146) (exempting from criminal
penalties one who transports a firearm from a place where \"he may
lawfully possess and carry such firearm\" but not exempting the
\"transportation\" of a firearm if it is \"readily accessible or is
directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting
vehicle\"). The statute simply could have said that such a person may
not \"carry\" a firearm. But, of course, Congress did not say this
because that is not what \"carry\" means.

As we interpret the statutory scheme, it makes sense. Congress has
imposed a variable penalty with no mandatory minimum sentence upon a
person who \"transports\" (or \[136\] \"ships\" or \"receives\") a
firearm knowing it will be used to commit any \"offense punishable by
imprisonment for \[more than\] one year,\" § 924(b), and it has imposed
a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence upon one who \"carries\" a firearm
\"during and in relation to\" a \"drug trafficking crime,\" § 924(c).
The first subsection imposes a less strict sentencing regime upon one
who, say, ships firearms by mail for use in a crime elsewhere; the
latter subsection imposes a mandatory sentence upon one who, say, brings
a weapon with him (on his person or in his car) to the site of a drug
sale.

Second, petitioners point out that, in *Bailey* v. *United States,* 516
U. S. 137 (1995), we considered the related phrase \"uses . . . a
firearm\" found in the same statutory provision now before us. See 18 U.
S. C. § 924(c)(1) (\"uses or carries a firearm\"). We construed the term
\"use\" narrowly, limiting its application to the \"active employment\"
of a firearm. *Bailey,* 516 U. S., at 144. Petitioners argue that it
would be anomalous to construe broadly the word \"carries,\" its
statutory next-door neighbor.

In *Bailey,* however, we limited \"use\" of a firearm to \"active
employment\" in part because we assumed \"that Congress. . . intended
each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\" *Id.* , at
146. A broader interpretation of \"use,\" we said, would have swallowed
up the term \"carry.\" *Ibid.* But \"carry\" as we interpret that word
does not swallow up the term \"use.\" \"Use\" retains the same
independent meaning we found for it in *Bailey,* where we provided
examples involving the displaying or the bartering of a gun. *Ibid.*
\"Carry\" also retains an independent meaning, for, under *Bailey,*
carrying a gun in a car does not necessarily involve the gun\'s \"active
employment.\" More importantly, having construed \"use\" narrowly in
*Bailey,* we cannot also construe \"carry\" narrowly without
undercutting the statute\'s basic objective. For the narrow
interpretation would remove the act of carrying a gun in a car entirely
from the statute\'s \[137\] reach, leaving a gap in coverage that we do
not believe Congress intended.

Third, petitioners say that our reading of the statute would extend its
coverage to passengers on buses, trains, or ships, who have placed a
firearm, say, in checked luggage. To extend this statute so far, they
argue, is unfair, going well beyond what Congress likely would have
thought possible. They add that some lower courts, thinking
approximately the same, have limited the scope of \"carries\" to
instances where a gun in a car is immediately accessible, thereby most
likely excluding from coverage a gun carried in a car\'s trunk or locked
glove compartment. See, *e. g.* , *Foster,* 133 F. 3d, at 708
(concluding that person \"carries\" a firearm in a car only if the
firearm is immediately accessible); *Giraldo,* 80 F. 3d, at 676 (same).

In our view, this argument does not take adequate account of other
limiting words in the statute---words that make the statute applicable
only where a defendant \"carries\" a gun *both* \"during *and* in
relation to\" a drug crime. § 924(c)(1) (emphasis added). Congress added
these words in part to prevent prosecution where guns \"played\" no part
in the crime. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 314, n. 10; cf. *United States*
v. *Stewart,* 779 F. 2d 538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (observing
that \"\`in relation to\' \" was \"added to allay explicitly the concern
that a person could be prosecuted . . . for committing an entirely
unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm\"), overruled in part
on other grounds, *United States* v. *Hernandez,* 80 F. 3d 1253, 1257
(CA9 1996).

Once one takes account of the words \"during\" and \"in relation to,\"
it no longer seems beyond Congress\' likely intent, or otherwise unfair,
to interpret the statute as we have done. If one carries a gun in a car
\"during\" and \"in relation to\" a drug sale, for example, the fact
that the gun is carried in the car\'s trunk or locked glove compartment
seems not only logically difficult to distinguish from the immediately
accessible gun, but also beside the point.

\[138\] At the same time, the narrow interpretation creates its own
anomalies. The statute, for example, defines \"firearm\" to include a
\"bomb,\" \"grenade,\" \"rocket having a propellant charge of more than
four ounces,\" or \"missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of
more than one-quarter ounce,\" where such device is \"explosive,\"
\"incendiary,\" or delivers \"poison gas.\" 18 U. S. C. § 921(a)(4)(A).
On petitioners\' reading, the \"carry\" provision would not apply to
instances where drug lords, engaged in a major transaction, took with
them \"firearms\" such as these, which most likely could not be carried
on the person.

Fourth, petitioners argue that we should construe the word \"carry\" to
mean \"immediately accessible.\" And, as we have said, they point out
that several Courts of Appeals have limited the statute\'s scope in this
way. See, *e. g.* , *Foster, supra,* at 708; *Giraldo, supra,* at 676.
That interpretation, however, is difficult to square with the statute\'s
language, for one \"carries\" a gun in the glove compartment whether or
not that glove compartment is locked. Nothing in the statute\'s history
suggests that Congress intended that limitation. And, for reasons
pointed out above, see *supra,* at 137, we believe that the words
\"during\" and \"in relation to\" will limit the statute\'s application
to the harms that Congress foresaw.

Finally, petitioners and the dissent invoke the \"rule of lenity.\" The
simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, however, is not sufficient
to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to
some degree. Cf. *Smith,* 508 U. S., at 239 (\"The mere possibility of
articulating a narrower construction . . . does not by itself make the
rule of lenity applicable\"). \"\`The rule of lenity applies only if,
\"after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,\" . . . we can
make \"no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"\` \" *United
States* v. *Wells,* 519 U. S. 482, 499 (1997) (quoting *Reno* v.
*Koray,* 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995), in turn quoting *Smith, supra,* at
239, and *Ladner* v. *United States,* 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). To
invoke the rule, we must conclude \[139\] that there is a \"\`
\"grievous ambiguity or uncertainty\"\` in the statute.\" *Staples* v.
*United States,* 511 U. S. 600, 619, n. 17 (1994) (quoting *Chapman* v.
*United States,* 500 U. S. 453, 463 (1991)). Certainly, our decision
today is based on much more than a \"guess as to what Congress
intended,\" and there is no \"grievous ambiguity\" here. The problem of
statutory interpretation in these cases is indeed no different from that
in many of the criminal cases that confront us. Yet, this Court has
never held that the rule of lenity automatically permits a defendant to
win.

In sum, the \"generally accepted contemporary meaning\" of the word
\"carry\" includes the carrying of a firearm in a vehicle. The purpose
of this statute warrants its application in such circumstances. The
limiting phrase \"during and in relation to\" should prevent misuse of
the statute to penalize those whose conduct does not create the risks of
harm at which the statute aims.

For these reasons, we conclude that petitioners\' conduct falls within
the scope of the phrase \"carries a firearm.\" The judgments of the
Courts of Appeals are affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

## Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Section 924(c)(1) of Title 18, United States Code, is a
punishment-enhancing provision; it imposes a mandatory five-year prison
term when the defendant \"during and in relation to any crime of
violence or drug trafficking .. . uses or carries a firearm.\" In
*Bailey* v. *United States,* 516 U. S. 137 (1995), this Court held that
the term \"uses,\" in the context of § 924(c)(1), means \"active
employment\" of the firearm. In today\'s cases we confront a related
question: What does the term \"carries\" mean in the context of §
924(c)(1), the enhanced punishment prescription again at issue.

It is uncontested that § 924(c)(1) applies when the defendant bears a
firearm, *i. e.,* carries the weapon on or about his \[140\] person
\"for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive
action in case of a conflict.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed.
1990) (defining the phrase \"carry arms or weapons\"); see *ante,* at
130. The Court holds that, in addition, \"carries a firearm,\" in the
context of § 924(c)(1), means personally transporting, possessing, or
keeping a firearm in a vehicle, anyplace in a vehicle.

Without doubt, \"carries\" is a word of many meanings, definable to mean
or include carting about in a vehicle. But that encompassing definition
is not a ubiquitously necessary one. Nor, in my judgment, is it a proper
construction of \"carries\" as the term appears in § 924(c)(1). In line
with *Bailey* and the principle of lenity the Court has long followed, I
would confine \"carries a firearm,\" for § 924(c)(1) purposes, to the
undoubted meaning of that expression in the relevant context. I would
read the words to indicate not merely keeping arms on one\'s premises or
in one\'s vehicle, but bearing them in such manner as to be ready for
use as a weapon.

## I

## A

I note first what is at stake for petitioners. The question before the
Court \"is not *whether* possession of a gun \[on the drug offender\'s
premises or in his car, during and in relation to commission of the
offense,\] means a longer sentence for a convicted drug dealer. It most
certainly does. . . . Rather, the question concerns *which sentencing
statute* governs the precise length of the extra term of punishment,\" §
924(c)(1)\'s \"blunt \`mandatory minimum\' \" five-year sentence, or the
more finely tuned \"sentencing guideline statutes, under which extra
punishment for drug-related gun possession varies with the seriousness
of the drug crime.\" *United States* v. *McFadden,* 13 F. 3d 463, 466
(CA1 1994) (Breyer, C. J., dissenting).

Accordingly, there would be no \"gap,\" see *ante,* at 137, no relevant
conduct \"ignore\[d\],\" see *ante,* at 133, were the Court to reject
the Government\'s broad reading of § 924(c)(1). To \[141\] be more
specific, as cogently explained on another day by today\'s opinion
writer:

> \"The special \`mandatory minimum\' sentencing statute says that
> anyone who \`*uses or carries\'* a gun \`during and in relation to any
> . . . drug trafficking crime\' must receive a mandatory five-year
> prison term added on to his drug crime sentence. 18 U. S. C. § 924(c).
> At the same time, the Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated under the
> authority of a different statute, 28 U. S. C. § 994, provide for a
> two-level (i. e., a 30% to 40%) sentence enhancement where a \`firearm
> . . . was possessed\' by a drug offender, U. S. S. G. § 2D1.1(b)(1),
> unless the possession clearly was not \`connected with the \[drug\]
> offense.\' \" *McFadden,* 13 F. 3d, at 467 (Breyer, C. J.,
> dissenting).

In Muscarello\'s case, for example, the underlying drug crimes involved
the distribution of 3.6 kilograms of marijuana, and therefore carried a
base offense level of 12. See United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(a)(3) (Nov. 1995). After adjusting for
Muscarello\'s acceptance of responsibility, see *id.,* § 3E1.1(a), his
final offense level was 10, placing him in the 6-to-12 month sentencing
range. See *id.,* ch. 5, pt. A. The two-level enhancement for possessing
a firearm, *id.,* § 2D1.1(b)(1), would have increased his final offense
level to 12 (a sentencing range of 10 to 16 months). In other words, the
less rigid (tailored to \"the seriousness of the drug crime,\"
*McFadden,* 13 F. 3d, at 466) Guidelines regime would have added four
months to Muscarello\'s prison time, in contrast to the five-year
minimum addition the Court\'s reading of § 924(c)(1)
mandates.[^\[3\]^](#Xc750faff03ca68cf64ddbf2277e9807b65fe2d6)

\[142\] In sum, drug traffickers will receive significantly longer
sentences if they are caught traveling in vehicles in which they have
placed firearms. The question that divides the Court concerns the proper
reference for enhancement in the cases at hand, the Guidelines or §
924(c)(1).

## B

Unlike the Court, I do not think
dictionaries,[^\[4\]^](#Xdd9b0eed9d948d65e2e99f007bcb53bb8656aa9)
surveys of press
reports,[^\[5\]^](#X000a043a36c440818532702524ca6fff0ffef53) or the
Bible[^\[6\]^](#Xdaabbf2dbe796c91fbbe22cb99fd840930043c2) tell us,
dispositively, what \"carries\" \[143\] means embedded in § 924(c)(1).
On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean, *inter
alia,* transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be
infectious, or wear or bear on one\'s
person.[^\[7\]^](#X0d10fa3e5fffbac210999deeb9dd5efd1b3778d) At issue
here is not \"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court\'s
computer search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns
in a car showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one-third\" of the
time. *Ante,* at 129. One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some
two-thirds of the time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the
Constitution\'s Second Amendment (\"keep and *bear* Arms\") (emphasis
added) and Black\'s Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or
carry . . .upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the
purpose .. . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action
in a case of conflict with another person.\"

On lessons from literature, a scan of Bartlett\'s and other quotation
collections shows how highly selective the Court\'s choices are. See
*ante,* at 129. If \"\[t\]he greatest of writers\" have used \"carry\"
to mean convey or transport in a vehicle, so have they used the
hydra-headed word to mean, *inter alia,* carry in one\'s hand, arms,
head, heart, or soul, sans vehicle. Consider, among countless examples:

> \"\[H\]e shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
> bosom.\" The King James Bible, Isaiah 40:11.
>
> \"And still they gaz\'d, and still the wonder grew,
>
> \[144\] That one small head could carry all he knew.\" O. Goldsmith,
> The Deserted Village, ll. 215-216, in The Poetical Works of Oliver
> Goldsmith 30 (A. Dobson ed. 1949).
>
> \"There\'s a Legion that never was \`listed, That carries no colours
> or crest.\" R. Kipling, The Lost Legion, st. 1, in Rudyard Kipling\'s
> Verse, 1885-1918, p. 222 (1920).
>
> \"There is a homely adage which runs, \`Speak softly and carry a big
> stick; you will go far.\' \" T. Roosevelt, Speech at Minnesota State
> Fair, Sept. 2, 1901, in J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 575:16 (J.
> Kaplan ed. 1992).[^\[8\]^](#Xe41e45a70451edca1dfdcb28e2c83d769b6c871)

These and the Court\'s lexicological sources demonstrate vividly that
\"carry\" is a word commonly used to convey various messages. Such
references, given their variety, are not reliable indicators of what
Congress meant, in § 924(c)(1), by \"carries a firearm.\"

## C

Noting the paradoxical statement, \"\`I *use* a gun to protect my house,
but I\'ve never had to *use* it,\' \" the Court in *Bailey,* 516 U. S.,
at 143, emphasized the importance of context--- the statutory context.
Just as \"uses\" was read to mean not simply \"possession,\" but
\"active employment,\" so \"carries,\" correspondingly, is properly read
to signal the most dangerous \[145\] cases---the gun at hand, ready for
use as a weapon.[^\[9\]^](#X4bbee754ce3653bd2cfbcc10f223b8de3621c48) It
is reasonable to comprehend Congress as having provided mandatory
minimums for the most life-jeopardizing gunconnection cases (guns in or
at the defendant\'s hand when committing an offense), leaving other,
less imminently threatening, situations for the more flexible Guidelines
regime.[^\[10\]^](#X94e74a584081045dea2c5dec673ce4d07b3ccf1) As the
Ninth Circuit suggested, it is not apparent why possession of a gun in a
drug dealer\'s moving vehicle would be thought more dangerous than gun
possession on premises where drugs are sold: \"A drug dealer who packs
heat is more likely to hurt someone or provoke someone else to violence.
A gun in a bag under a tarp in a truck bed \[or in a bedroom closet\]
poses substantially less risk.\" *United States* v. *Foster,* 133 F. 3d
704, 707 (1998) (en
banc).[^\[11\]^](#X3acfe8c64ce38f8a2be863fba1df4d8177007c4)

For indicators from Congress itself, it is appropriate to consider word
usage in other provisions of Title 18\'s chapter on \"Firearms.\" See
*Bailey,* 516 U. S., at 143, 146 (interpreting § 924(c)(1) in light of
18 U. S. C. §§ 922(g), 922(j), 922(k), 922(*o* )(1), 924(d)(1), 930(a),
930(b)). The Court, however, \[146\] does not derive from the statutory
complex at issue its thesis that \"\`\[c\]arry\' implies personal agency
and some degree of possession, whereas \`transport\' does not have such
a limited connotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods in
bulk over great distances.\" *Ante,* at 134. Looking to provisions
Congress enacted, one finds that the Legislature did not acknowledge or
routinely adhere to the distinction the Court advances today; instead,
Congress sometimes employed \"transports\" when, according to the Court,
\"carries\" was the right word to use.

Section 925(a)(2)(B), for example, provides that no criminal sanction
shall attend \"the transportation of \[a\] firearm or ammunition carried
out to enable a person, who lawfully received such firearm or ammunition
from the Secretary of the Army, to engage in military training or in
competitions.\" The full text of § 926A, rather than the truncated
version the Court presents, see *ibid.,* is also telling:

> \"Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or
> regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person
> who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting,
> shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a
> firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully
> possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may
> lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation
> the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition
> being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from
> the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle: *Provided,*
> That in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the
> driver\'s compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in
> a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.\"

In describing when and how a person may travel in a vehicle that
contains his firearm without violating the law, \[147\] §§ 925(a)(2)(B)
and 926A use \"transport,\" not \"carry,\" to \"impl\[y\] personal
agency and some degree of possession.\"
*Ibid.*[^\[12\]^](#Xebe4db39d49fb0b79c37dd27aa965c5ef9397bc)

Reading \"carries\" in § 924(c)(1) to mean \"on or about \[one\'s\]
person\" is fully compatible with these and other \"Firearms\"
statutes.[^\[13\]^](#X0f75cad48fb24758db2d396dc89e27fcb64263b) For
example, under § 925(a)(2)(B), one could carry his gun to a car,
transport it to the shooting competition, and use it to shoot targets.
Under the conditions of § 926A, one could transport her gun in a car,
but under no circumstances could the gun be readily accessible while she
travels in the car. \"\[C\]ourts normally try to read language in
different, but related, statutes, so as best to reconcile \[148\] those
statutes, in light of their purposes and of common sense.\" *McFadden,*
13 F. 3d, at 467 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting). So reading the
\"Firearms\" statutes, I would not extend the word \"carries\" in §
924(c)(1) to mean transports out of hand\'s reach in a
vehicle.[^\[14\]^](#X6a82ba99a49629cb40cb19a968e02bb3155f740)

## II

Section 924(c)(1), as the foregoing discussion details, is not
decisively clear one way or another. The sharp division in the Court on
the proper reading of the measure confirms, \"\[a\]t the very least, . .
. that the issue is subject to some doubt. Under these circumstances, we
adhere to the familiar rule that, \`where there is ambiguity in a
criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\' \"
*Adamo Wrecking Co.* v. *United States,* 434 U. S. 275, 284-285 (1978)
(citation omitted); see *United States* v. *Granderson,* 511 U. S. 39,
54 (1994) (\"\[W\]here text, structure, and history fail to establish
that the Government\'s position is unambiguously correct---we apply the
rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in \[the defendant\'s\]
favor.\"). \"Carry\" bears many meanings, \[149\] as the Court and the
\"Firearms\" statutes
demonstrate.[^\[15\]^](#X16d8d087f55b3ec7c94ee172cc5f307cf216c78) The
narrower \"on or about \[one\'s\] person\" interpretation is hardly
implausible nor at odds with an accepted meaning of \"carries a
firearm.\"

Overlooking that there will be an enhanced sentence for the
gun-possessing drug dealer in any event, see *supra,* at 140-142, the
Court asks rhetorically: \"How persuasive is a punishment that is
without effect until a drug dealer who has brought his gun to a sale
(indeed has it available for use) actually takes it from the trunk (or
unlocks the glove compartment) of his car?\" *Ante,* at 133.
Correspondingly, the Court defines \"carries a firearm\" to cover \"a
person who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms \[anyplace\] in a
vehicle . . . which the person accompanies.\" *Ante,* at 126-127.
Congress, however, hardly lacks competence to select the words
\"possesses\" or \"conveys\" when that is what the Legislature
means.[^\[16\]^](#Xb59d6aad0733d6cd6754bfbdc10313268bf15d5) Notably in
view of the Legislature\'s capacity to speak plainly, and of overriding
concern, the Court\'s inquiry \[150\] pays scant attention to a core
reason for the rule of lenity: \"\[B\]ecause of the seriousness of
criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents
the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts
should define criminal activity. This policy embodies \`the instinctive
distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has
clearly said they should.\' \" *United States* v. *Bass,* 404 U. S. 336,
348 (1971) (quoting H. Friendly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading
of Statutes, in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967)).

\* \* \*

The narrower \"on or about \[one\'s\] person\" construction of \"carries
a firearm\" is consistent with the Court\'s construction of \"uses\" in
*Bailey* to entail an immediacy element. It respects the Guidelines
system by resisting overbroad readings of statutes that deviate from
that system. See *McFadden,* 13 F. 3d, at 468 (Breyer, C. J.,
dissenting). It fits plausibly with other provisions of the \"Firearms\"
chapter, and it adheres to the principle that, given two readings of a
penal provision, both consistent with the statutory text, we do not
choose the harsher construction. The Court, in my view, should leave it
to Congress to speak \"\`in language that is clear and definite\' \" if
the Legislature wishes to impose the sterner penalty. *Bass,* 404 U. S.,
at 347 (quoting *United States* v. *Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp.,*
344 U. S. 218, 222 (1952)). Accordingly, I would reverse the judgments

[\[9\]](#X74652d3b8069cc74a406774b95ab282cf92ff1b) In my view, the
Government would carry its burden by proving a firearm was kept so close
to the person as to approximate placement in a pocket or holster, *e.
g.,* guns carried at one\'s side in a briefcase or handbag, or strapped
to the saddle of a horse. See *ante,* at 130.

[\[10\]](#X79cd1f997b42497e22a9eafecc50a3514660b60) The Court reports
that the Courts of Appeals \"have unanimously concluded that \`carry\'
is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the person.\"
*Ante,* at 131. In *Bailey,* however, the Government\'s argument based
on a similar observation did not carry the day. See Brief for United
States in *Bailey* v. *United States,* O. T. 1995, Nos. 94-7448 and
94-7492, p. 16, n. 4. No Court of Appeals had previously adopted an
\"active employment\" construction of \"uses . . . a firearm\" in §
924(c)(1), yet this Court did exactly that. See 516 U. S., at 144.

[\[11\]](#X2db66c2476d1221059a9b13353465778835b4b0) The \"Firearms\"
statutes indicate that Congress, unlike the Court, *ante,* at 132-133,
recognizes that a gun in the hand is indeed more dangerous than a gun in
the trunk. See, *e. g.,* 18 U. S. C. § 926A (permitting the
transportation of firearms in a vehicle, but only if \"neither the
firearm nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is
directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting
vehicle\"); see *infra,* at 146-147.

[\[12\]](#X9dfe4982bcab864368e44890ef1bf2537eec7c7) The Court asserts
that \"\`transport\' is a broader category that includes \`carry\' but
also encompasses other activity.\" *Ante,* at 135. \"Carry,\" however,
is not merely a subset of \"transport.\" A person seated at a desk with
a gun in hand or pocket is carrying the gun, but is not transporting it.
Yes, the words \"carry\" and \"transport\" often can be employed
interchangeably, as can the words \"carry\" and \"use.\" But in
*Bailey,* this Court settled on constructions that gave \"carry\" and
\"use\" independent meanings. See 516 U. S., at 145-146. Without doubt,
Congress is alert to the discrete meanings of \"transport\" and
\"carry\" in the context of vehicles, as the Legislature\'s placement of
each word in § 926A illustrates. The narrower reading of \"carry\"
preserves discrete meanings for the two words, while in the context of
vehicles the Court\'s interpretation of \"carry\" is altogether
synonymous with \"transport.\" Tellingly, when referring to firearms
traveling in vehicles, the \"Firearms\" statutes routinely use a form of
\"transport\"; they never use a form of \"carry.\"

[\[13\]](#Xe4629a6502cf0095dd33496e8c9c75efd5529d6) See *infra,* at 149,
nn. 13, 14. The Government points to numerous federal statutes that
authorize law enforcement officers to \"carry firearms\" and notes that,
in those authorizing provisions, \"carry\" of course means \"both on the
person and in a vehicle.\" Brief for United States 31-32, and n. 18.
Quite right. But as viewers of \"Sesame Street\" will quickly recognize,
\"one of these things \[a statute *authorizing* conduct\] is not like
the other \[a statute *criminalizing* conduct\].\" The authorizing
statutes in question are properly accorded a construction compatible
with the clear purpose of the legislation to aid federal law enforcers
in the performance of their official duties. It is fundamental, however,
that a penal statute is not to be construed generously in the
Government\'s favor. See, *e. g.,* *United States* v. *Bass,* 404 U. S.
336, 348 (1971).

seeks \"\`to persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony
to leave his gun at home.\' \" *Ante,* at 132 (quoting 114 Cong. Rec.
22231 (1968)). As the Government argued in its brief to this Court in
*Bailey:* \"In making that statement, Representative Poff was not
referring to the \`carries\' prong of the original Section 924(c). As
originally enacted, the \`carries\' prong of the statute prohibited only
the \`unlawful\' carrying of a firearm while committing an offense. The
statute would thus not have applied to an individual who, for instance,
had a permit for carrying a gun and carried it with him when committing
an offense, and it would have had no force in \`persuading\' such an
individual \`to leave his gun at home.\' Instead, Representative Poff

Brief for United States in *Bailey* v. *United States,* O. T. 1995, Nos.

Opinion

DOWDS, J.

Defendant, charged with a violation of Penal Code section 487,
subdivision 1, grand theft, appeals his conviction after a jury trial of
petty theft, a lesser but necessarily included offense. His contention
on appeal is that the jury was improperly instructed. The only facts set
forth in the recprd on appeal are that defendant was charged with
stealing four wooden beams from a construction site and that the state
of the evidence was such that the jury could have found that the
defendant believed either (1) that the beams had been abandoned as
worthless and the owner had no objection to his taking them or (2) that
they had substantial value, had not been abandoned and he had no right
to take them.

The court refused two jury instructions proposed by defendant reading as
follows:

> *Defendant's A*
>
> "If one takes personal property with the good faith belief that the
> property has been abandoned or discarded by the true owner, he is not
> guilty of theft. This is the case even if such good faith belief is
> unreasonable. The prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
> the defendant did not so believe for you to convict a defendant of
> theft."
>
> *Defendant's B*
>
> "If one takes personal property with the good faith belief that he has
> permission to take the property, he is not guilty of theft. This is
> the case even if such good faith belief is unreasonable.
>
> The prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
> did not so believe for you to convict a defendant of theft."

Instead, the court instructed the jury in the words of the following
modified instructions:

> *Modified-Defendant's A*
>
> "If one takes personal property in the reasonable and good faith
> belief that the property has been abandoned or discarded by the true
> owner, he is not guilty of theft."
>
> *Modified-Defendant's B*
>
> "If one takes personal property in the reasonable and good faith
> belief that he has the consent or permission of the owner to take the
> property, he is not guilty of theft.
>
> "If you have a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the required
> criminal intent as specified in these instructions, the defendant is
> entitled to an acquittal."

Accordingly, the question for determination on appeal is whether the
defendant should be acquitted if there is a reasonable doubt that he had
a good faith belief that the property had been abandoned or that he had
the permission of the owner to take the property or whether that belief
must be a reasonable one as well as being held in good faith.

**\[ ... \]**

Evidence was presented**\[ ... \]** from which the jury could have
concluded that defendant believed that the wooden beams had been
abandoned and that the owner had no objection to his taking them, i.e.,
that he lacked the specific criminal intent required to commit the crime
of theft (intent permanently to deprive an owner of his property). A
similar situation existed in *People* v. *Photo* (1941) 45 Cal.App.2d
345 \[114 P.2d 71\], where defendant's conviction of grand theft for the
taking of certain boxes of oranges which he thought he had purchased was
reversed**\[ ... \]**

Earlier California cases are to the same effect. In *People* v. *Devine*
(1892) 95 Cal. 227 \[30 P. 378\], defendant's conviction of larceny was
reversed. He had driven away in a wagon, without any attempt at secrecy,
a number of hogs, his own and three bearing another's mark or brand. The
Supreme Court pointed out: "*\[W\]*here a felonious intent must be
proven, it can be done only by proving what the accused knew. One cannot
intend to steal property which he believes to be his own. He may be
careless, and omit to make an effort to ascertain that the property
which he thinks his own belongs to another; but so long as he believes
it to be his own, he cannot feloniously steal it\.... " *(Id.* at pp.
230-231.)

**\[ ... \]**

Cases in other jurisdictions also hold that where the law requires a
specific criminal intent, it is not enough merely to prove that a
reasonable man would have had that intent, without meeting the burden of
proof that the defendant himself also entertained it. For example, in
*State* v. *Ebbeller* (1920) 283 Mo. 57. \[222 S.W. 396\], a conviction
of knowingly receiving a stolen automobile was reversed because the
court gave the following erroneous jury instruction: "'Éy the term
"knowing" that the property was stolen is not meant absolute personal
and certain knowledge on the part of the defendant that the property
mentioned in the indictment had been stolen, but such knowledge and
information in his possession at the time he received the same, if you
believe he did receive it, as would put a reasonably prudent man,
exercising ordinary caution, on his guard, and would cause such a man
exercising such caution, and under circumstances which you believe
defendant received the property, to believe and be satisfied that the
property had been stolen.'" (222 S.W. at p. 397.)

In reversing, the court pointed out the error in the instruction as
follows: "It will be noticed that the instruction does permit a
conviction if the facts were such as (in the opinion of the jury) would
have caused a reasonably prudent person, exercising ordinary caution, to
have believed that the property had been stolen at the time received.

"We are inclined to the view \... that the learned attorney representing
the appellant is correct in stating that---"'The question is not what
some other person would have believed and known from the circumstances
attending the receipt of the property, but what did this defendant
believe and know.'" *(Id.)*

**\[ ... \]**

La Fave and Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law (1972) sets forth at page
357 what the authors call the ". . .rather simple rule that an honest
mistake of fact or law is a defense when it negates a required mental
element of the crime . . . . " As an example they refer to the crime of
receiving stolen property, stating "\... if the defendant by a mistake
of either fact or law did not know the goods were stolen, even though
the circumstances would have led a prudent man to believe they were
stolen, he does not have the required mental state and thus may not be
convicted of the crime."

In the instant case the trial court in effect instructed the jury that
even though defendant in good faith believed he had the right to take
the beams, and thus lacked the specific intent required for the crime of
theft, he should be convicted unless such belief was reasonable. In
doing so it erred.[^33] It is true that if the jury thought the
defendant's belief to be unreasonable, it might infer that he did not in
good faith hold such belief. If, however, it concluded that defendant in
good faith believed that he had the right to take the beams, even though
such belief was unreasonable as measured by the objective standard of a
hypothetical reasonable man, defendant was entitled to an acquittal
since the specific intent required to be proved as an element of the
offense had not been established.[^34]

The People's reliance on *People* v. *Mayberry* (1975) 15 Cal.3d 143
\[125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337\] is misplaced. The discussion in
that case involved the propriety of an instruction on mistake of fact in
respect of charges of rape and kidnaping, general intent crimes, a
different question from that here presented.

The judgment is reversed.

People v. Snyder , 32 Cal.3d 590

\[Crim. No. 22293. Supreme Court of California. October 18, 1982.\]\
THE PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. NEVA B. SNYDER, Defendant and
Appellant (Opinion by Richardson, J., with Bird, C. J., Mosk and Kaus,
JJ., concurring. Separate dissenting opinion by Broussard, with Newman
and Reynoso, JJ., concurring.)

OPINION RICHARDSON, J.

Defendant Neva Snyder appeals from a judgment convicting her of
possession of a concealable firearm by a convicted felon (Pen. Code, §
12021), based upon her 1973 conviction for sale of marijuana, a felony
(former Health & Saf. Code, § 11531). Defendant contends that the trial
court erred in excluding evidence of her mistaken belief that her prior
conviction was only a misdemeanor. We will conclude that defendant\'s
asserted mistake regarding her legal status as a convicted felon did not
constitute a defense to the firearm possession charge. Accordingly, we
will affirm the judgment.

At trial, defendant offered to prove the following facts supporting her
theory of mistake: The marijuana possession charge resulted from a plea
bargain not involving a jail or prison sentence. At the time the bargain
was struck, defendant\'s attorney advised her that she was pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor. Believing that she was not a felon, defendant
thereafter had registered to vote,

and had voted. On one prior occasion, police officers found a gun in her
home but, after determining that it was registered to her husband, the
officers filed no charges against defendant. The trial court refused to
admit any evidence of defendant\'s mistaken belief that her prior
conviction was a misdemeanor and that she was not a felon. The court
also rejected proposed instructions requiring proof of defendant\'s
prior knowledge of her felony conviction as an element of the offense
charged.\
Penal Code section 12021, subdivision (a), provides: \"Any person who
has been convicted of a felony under the laws of the \... State of
California \... who owns or has in his possession or under his custody
or control any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being
concealed upon the person is guilty of a public offense, \...\"\
\[1\] The elements of the offense proscribed by section 12021 are
conviction of a felony and ownership, possession, custody or control of
a firearm capable of being concealed on the person. (citations omitted)
No specific criminal intent is required, and a general intent to commit
the proscribed act is sufficient to sustain a conviction. With respect
to the elements of possession or custody, it has been held that
knowledge is an element of the offense.\
\[2\] Does section 12021 also require knowledge of one\'s legal status
as a convicted felon? No case has so held. Penal Code section 26
provides that a person is incapable of committing a crime if he acted
under a \"mistake of fact\" which disproves criminal intent. In this
regard, the cases have distinguished between mistakes of fact and
mistakes of law. As we stated in an early case: \"It is an emphatic
postulate of both civil and penal law that ignorance of a law is no
excuse for a violation thereof. Of course, it is based on a fiction,
because no man can know all the law, but it is a maxim which the law
itself does not permit any one to gainsay \.... The rule rests on public
necessity; the welfare of society and the safety of the state depend
upon its enforcement. If a person accused of a crime could shield
himself behind the defense that he was ignorant of the law which he
violated, immunity from punishment would in most cases result.\"
(citations omitted) Accordingly, lack of actual knowledge of the
provisions of Penal Code section 12021 is irrelevant; the crucial
question is whether the defendant was aware that he was engaging in the
conduct proscribed by that section.\
In the present case, defendant was presumed to know that it is unlawful
for a convicted felon to possess a concealable firearm. (Pen. Code, §
12021.) She was also charged with knowledge that

the offense of which she was convicted (former Health & Saf. Code, §
11531) was, as a matter of law, a felony. That section had prescribed a
state prison term of from five years to life, and the express statutory
definition of a \"felony\" is \"a crime which is punishable with death
or by imprisonment in the state prison.\" (Pen. Code, § 17, subd. (a).)

Thus, regardless of what she reasonably believed, or what her attorney
may have told her, defendant was deemed to know under the law that she
was a convicted felon forbidden to possess concealable firearms. Her
asserted mistake regarding her correct legal status was a mistake of
law, not fact. It does not constitute a defense to section 12021.\
None of the California cases relied on by defendant is apposite here.
People v. Hernandez (1964) 61 Cal.2d 529​, and People v. Mayberry (1975)
​15 Cal.3d 143​, each involved mistakes of fact, not law. In Hernandez,
the mistake concerned the age of the alleged victim of a statutory rape.
In Mayberry, defendant erred in assuming that the adult victim of
forcible rape consented to his acts. People v. Vogel (1956) ​46 Cal.2d
798​, involved the good faith belief of a defendant charged with bigamy
that he is free to remarry. We were careful to explain that defendant\'s
mistake was a factual one: \"We have concluded that defendant is not
guilty of bigamy, if he had a bona fide and reasonable belief that facts
existed that left him free to remarry.\" (Id., at p. 801) Moreover,
Vogel characterized bigamy as a crime which \"has been regarded for
centuries as \... involving moral turpitude, \...\" Obviously a bona
fide belief that one is free to remarry nullifies the moral opprobrium
attached to the charge. On the other hand, being an ex-felon in
possession of a concealable firearm, while illegal, hardly stamps the
person charged as a moral leper. His belief that he is not a felon thus
does not affect the criminality of his conduct.\
\...\
We conclude that the trial court properly excluded evidence of
defendant\'s asserted mistake regarding her status as a convicted
felon.\
The judgment is affirmed.

BROUSSARD, J.\
I dissent.\
The two elements of a violation of Penal Code section 12021 are felony
status and possession of a concealable firearm. While no specific
criminal intent is required, a general criminal intent

should be required as to both elements in accordance with long-settled
rules of statutory interpretation, and an honest and reasonable mistake
as to either element of the offense, however induced, should negate the
requisite general criminal intent. Defendant\'s testimony if believed
would have established an honest and reasonable mistaken belief that her
prior offense was not a felony but a misdemeanor, and it was prejudicial
error to refuse to admit the evidence and to refuse instructions on the
mistake doctrine.\
The majority have adopted a special strict liability rule as to section
12021, holding that a felon is charged with knowledge of his status and
that an honest and reasonable mistaken belief as to the nature of the
conviction is not a defense unless apparently it is induced or
corroborated in whole or in part by governmental conduct. The
traditional and longstanding defense of mistake negating criminal intent
should not be limited to situations where the mistake is induced or
corroborated by government officials. \...

Present: Roberts, C. J., Paolino, Joslin, Kelleher and Doris, JJ.

Roberts, C. J.

These are two indictments, one (No. 70-573) charging the defendant,
Henry Rose, with leaving the scene of an accident, death resulting, in
violation of G. L. 1956 (1968 Reenactment) §31-26-l[^35] and the other
(No. 70-572) charging the defendant with manslaughter. The defendant was
tried on both indictments to a jury in the Superior Court, and a verdict
of guilty was returned in each case. Thereafter the defendant's motions
for a new trial were denied, and he is now prosecuting a bill of
exceptions in each case in this court.

These indictments followed the death of David J. Mc-Enery, who was
struck by defendant's motor vehicle at the intersection of Broad and
Summer Streets in Providence at about 6:30 p.m. on April 1, 1970.
According to the testimony of a bus driver, **\[ ... \]**he observed a
pedestrian starting to cross Broad Street, and as the pedestrian reached
the middle of the southbound lane he was struck by a "dirty, white
station wagon" that was proceeding southerly on Broad Street. The
pedestrian's body was thrown up on the hood of the car. The bus driver
further testified that the station wagon stopped momentarily, the body
of the pedestrian rolled off the hood, and the car immediately drove off
along Broad Street in a southerly direction. The bus operator testified
that he had alighted from his bus, intending to attempt to assist the
victim, but was unable to locate the body.

Subsequently, it appears from the testimony of a police ■officer, about
6:40 p.m. the police located a white station wagon on Haskins Street, a
distance of some 610 feet from the scene of the accident. The police
further testified that a body later identified as that of David J.
McEnery was wedged beneath the vehicle when it was found and that the
vehicle had been registered to defendant.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**defendant directs our attention to the fact that the court
charged the jury that there was no evidence in the case of culpable
negligence on the part of defendant up to and including the time at
which Mr. McEnery was struck by the station wagon. He further charged
the jury that, in order to find defendant guilty of manslaughter, it
would be necessary to find that McEnery was alive immediately after the
impact and that the conduct of defendant following the impact
constituted culpable negligence.

The defendant is contending that if the evidence is susceptible of a
finding that McEnery was killed upon impact, he was not alive at the
time he was being dragged under defendant's vehicle and defendant could
not be found guilty of manslaughter. An examination of the testimony of
the only medical witness makes it clear that, in his opinion, death
could have resulted immediately upon impact by reason of a massive
fracture of the skull. The medical witness also testified that death
could have resulted a few minutes after the impact but conceded that he
was not sure when it did occur.

We are inclined to agree with defendant's contention in this respect.
Obviously, the evidence is such that death could have occurred after
defendant had driven away with McEnery's body lodged under his car and,
therefore, be consistent with guilt. On the other hand, the medical
testimony is equally consistent with a finding that McEnery could have
died instantly upon impact and, therefore, be consistent with a
reasonable conclusion other than the guilt of defendant. It is clear,
then, that, the testimony of the medical examiner lacking any reasonable
medical certainty as to the time of the death of McEnery, we are unable
to conclude that on such evidence defendant was guilty of manslaughter
beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we conclude, with respect to
Indictment No. 70-572, that it was error to deny defendant's motion for
a directed verdict of acquittal. *See State* v. *Dancyger, supra.*

We are unable, however, to reach the same conclusion concerning the
denial of the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal with respect to
Indictment No. 70-573, in which defendant was charged with leaving the
scene of an accident. The testimony adduced through the bus driver
clearly establishes that at the time McEnery was struck his body was
thrown up on the hood of the car and that while the car was standing
still the body rolled off the hood and thereupon defendant drove off in
a southerly direction. Later, the police found defendant's station wagon
on a side street some 610 feet from the point of impact with McEnery's
body wedged under the front of the car.**\[ ... \]**

Because we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant's
motion for a directed verdict of acquittal in the case charging him with
manslaughter, it is unnecessary for us to consider his contentions of
error concerning his motion for a new trial in that case.

**\[ ... \]**

The exception of the defendant to the denial of his motion for a
directed verdict in the manslaughter case, Indictment No. 70-572, is
sustained, and the judgment of conviction is reversed; all of the
defendant's exceptions to rulings in the case charging him with leaving
the scene of an accident, Indictment No. 70-573, are overruled; and both
cases are remitted to the Superior Court for further proceedings.

Before SCHWARTZ, C.J., and HUBBART and GERSTEN, JJ.

HUBBART, Judge.

This is an appeal by the defendant Isaac Alejandro Velazquez from a
final judgment of conviction and sentence for vehicular homicide **\[
... \]**The sole issue presented for review is whether a defendant
driver of a motor vehicle who participates in a reckless and illegal
"drag race" on a public road may be properly convicted of vehicular
homicide \[§ 782.071, Fla.Stat. (1987)\] for the death of one of the
co-participant drivers suffered in the course of the "drag race" ---
when the sole basis for imposing liability is the defendant's
participation in said race. We hold that the defendant may not be held
criminally liable under the above statute in such case because the
co-participant driver, in effect, killed himself by his voluntary and
reckless driving in the subject "drag race" and thus the defendant's
actions in engaging in the said race was not a proximate cause of the
co-participant's death.

I

The defendant Velazquez was charged by information with the crime of
vehicular homicide. Specifically, the information alleged that on April
23, 1988, the defendant

> "did unlawfully and feloniously operate a motor vehicle in a reckless
> manner, to wit: Participated in a DRAG RACE, RAN A STOP SIGN and
> EXCEEDED the SPEED LIMIT with his VEHICLE, and thereby cause the death
> of ADAL-BERTO ALVAREZ, in violation of 782.-071 Florida Statutes."

The defendant filed a motion to dismiss this information under
Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.190(c)(4) on the ground that the undisputed material
facts in the case demonstrated that the state did not, as a matter of
law, have a prima facie case of vehicular homicide against the
defendant. **\[ ... \]**Accepting the sworn facts stated in the motion
to dismiss, as supplemented and altered by the traverse, the material
undisputed facts in the case are as follows.

On April 23, 1988, at approximately 2:30 A.M., the defendant Velazquez
met the deceased Adalberto Alvarez at a Hardee's restaurant in Hialeah,
Florida. The two had never previously met, but in the course of their
conversation agreed to race each other in a "drag race" with their
respective automobiles. They, accordingly, left the restaurant and
proceeded to set up a quarter-mile "drag race" course on a nearby public
road which ran perpendicular to a canal alongside the Palmetto
Expressway in Hialeah; a guardrail and a visible stop sign[**\[ ...
\]**](#X7073d8ad385c069d5ebf2bbf1a9903b5c526bca) stood between the end
of this road and the canal. The two men began their "drag race" at the
end of this road and proceeded away from the canal in a westerly
direction for one-quarter mile. Upon completing the course without
incident, the deceased Alvarez suddenly turned his automobile 180
degrees around and proceeded east toward the starting line and the
canal; the defendant Velazquez did the same and followed behind Alvarez.
Alvarez proceeded in the lead and attained an estimated speed of 123
m.p.h.; he was not wearing a seat belt and subsequent investigation
revealed that he had a blood alcohol level between .11 and .12. The
defendant Velazquez, who had not been drinking, trailed Alvarez the
entire distance back to the starting line and attained an estimated
speed of 98 m.p.h. As both drivers approached the end of the road, they
applied their brakes, but neither could stop. Alvarez, who was about a
car length ahead of the defendant Velazquez, crashed through the
guardrail first and was propelled over the entire canal, landing on its
far bank; he was thrown from his car upon impact, was pinned under his
vehicle when it landed on him, and died instantly from the resulting
injuries. The defendant also crashed through the guardrail, but landed
in the canal where he was able to escape from his vehicle and swim to
safety uninjured.

Based on these facts, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss,
finding that it was a question of fact for the jury as to whether the
defendant's participation in the "drag race" was a sufficient legal
cause of the deceased's death so as to support a conviction for
vehicular homicide. **\[ ... \]**

II

The vehicular homicide statute, under which the defendant was charged
and convicted, provides as follows:

> " 'Vehicular homicide' is the killing of a human being by the
> operation of a motor vehicle by another in a reckless manner likely to
> cause the death of, or great bodily harm to, another. Vehicular
> homicide is a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s.
> 775.082, s. 775.-083, or s. 775.084."

§ 782.071(1), Fla.Stat. (1987). There are two statutory elements to
vehicular homi-cide: (1) the defendant must operate a motor vehicle in a
reckless manner likely to cause the death of, or great bodily harm to,
another, and (2) this reckless operation of a motor vehicle must be the
proximate cause of the death of a human being. **\[ ... \]**

Contrary to the defendant's argument, we have no trouble in concluding
that the first element of this offense is clearly established on this
record. Plainly, the defendant operated a motor vehicle in a reckless
manner, likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another, in that
(a) he participated in a highly dangerous "drag race" with the deceased
on a public road in which both lanes were used as a speedway, and (b) he
drove his vehicle at the excessive speed of 98 m.p.h. during the "drag
race." Without question, the defendant's motor vehicle operation
endangered the lives of all persons in the vicinity of the "drag race,"
namely, people in other motor vehicles and nearby pedestrians. *See
McCreary v. State,* 371 So.2d 1024 (Fla.1979).

The second element of this offense, however, has given us considerable
pause, as no doubt it did the trial court, because no endangered third
party in the vicinity of the "drag race" was killed in this case;
moreover, it is here that the parties to this appeal marshal their
primary authorities and argument. **\[ ... \]** we approach this subject
with a certain degree of caution, mindful that the problems raised by
the element of "proximate cause" in cases of this nature "present
enormous difficulty (especially in homicide \[cases\]) because of the
obscurity of that concept," an obscurity which has resulted in the
announcement of "varying and sometimes inconsistent rules in the
numerous areas in which the problem has arisen." *Model Penal Code and
Commentaries* § 2.03 comment 1, at 255-56 (1985).

A

At the outset, it seems clear that the proximate cause element of
vehicular homicide in Florida embraces, at the very least, a
causation-in-fact test; that is, the defendant's reckless operation of a
motor vehicle must be a cause-in-fact of the death of a human being. In
this respect, vehicular homicide is no different than any other criminal
offense in which the occurrence of a specified result, caused by a
defendant's conduct, is an essential element of the offense --- such as
murder, \[§ 782.04, Fla.Stat. (1989)\], manslaughter \[§ 782.07,
Fla.Stat. (1989)\], aggravated battery \[§ 784.045, Fla.Stat. (1989) \],
and arson \[§ 806.01, Fla. Stat. (1989) \]. Clearly there can be no
criminal liability for such result-type offenses unless it can be shown
that the defendant's conduct was a cause-in-fact of the prohibited
result, whether the result be the death of a human being, personal
injury to another, or injury to another's property. To be sure, this
cause-in-fact showing is insufficient in itself to establish the
aforesaid "proximate cause" element in a vehicular homicide case, but it
is clearly a sine qua non ingredient thereof. **\[ ... \]**

Courts throughout the country have uniformly followed the traditional
"but for" test in determining whether the defendant's conduct was a
cause-in-fact of a prohibited consequence in result-type offenses such
as vehicular homicide. Under this test, a defendant's conduct is a
cause-in-fact of the prohibited result if the said result would *not*
have occurred "but for" the defendant's conduct; stated differently, the
defendant's conduct is a cause-in-fact of a particular result if the
result would *not* have happened in the absence of the defendant's
conduct. Thus, a defendant's reckless operation of a motor vehicle is a
cause-in-fact of the death of a human being under Florida's vehicular
homicide statute \[§ 782.071(1), Fla.Stat. (1987)\] if the subject death
would *not* have occurred "but for" the defendant's reckless driving or
would *not* have happened in the absence of such driving. 1 W. LaFave &
A. Scott, *Substantive Criminal Law* § 3.12(b), at 393-94 (1986); *Model
Penal Code and Commentaries* § 2.03 and comment 2, at 257-58 (1985);
*compare Stahl v. Metropolitan Dade County,* 438 So.2d 14, 17-18 (Fla.
3d DCA 1983).

In relatively rare cases, however, the "but for" test for
causation-in-fact fails and has been abandoned in favor of the
"substantial factor" test. This anomaly occurs when two defendants,
acting independently and not in concert with one another, commit two
separate acts, each of which alone is sufficient to bring about the
prohibited result --- as when two defendants concurrently inflict mortal
wounds upon a human being, each of which is sufficient to cause death.
In such case, each defendant's action was not a "but for" cause of death
because the deceased would have died even in the absence of each
defendant's conduct --- although obviously not in the absence of both
defendants' conduct considered together. In these rare cases, the courts
have followed a "substantial factor" test, namely, the defendant's
conduct is a cause-in-fact of a prohibited result if the subject conduct
was a "substantial factor" in bringing about the said result. Thus, each
defendant's conduct in independently and concurrently inflicting mortal
wounds on a deceased clearly constitutes a "substantial factor" in
bringing about the deceased's death, and, consequently, is a
cause-in-fact of the deceased's death. 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott,
*Substantive Criminal Law* § 3.12(b), at 394-95 (1986); *compare Stahl
v. Metropolitan Dade County,* 438 So.2d 14, 18 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).

B

The "proximate cause" element of vehicular homicide in Florida embraces
more, however, than the aforesaid "but for" causation-in-fact test as
modified by the "substantial factor" exception. Even where a defendant's
conduct is a cause-in-fact of a prohibited result, as where a
defendant's reckless operation of a motor vehicle is a cause-in-fact of
the death of a human being, Florida and other courts throughout the
country have for good reason declined to impose criminal liability (1)
where the prohibited result of the defendant's conduct is beyond the
scope of any fair assessment of the danger created by the defendant's
conduct, or (b) where it would otherwise be unjust, based on fairness
and policy considerations, to hold the defendant criminally responsible
for the prohibited result. **\[ ... \]**

In deaths resulting from illegal "drag racing" on a public road, as
here, it has been held in Florida that the driver of one of the racing
vehicles was properly convicted of manslaughter when the driver of
another vehicle in the race collided head on with a non-participant
motor vehicle which was lawfully using the subject highway, killing the
driver of same. **\[ ... \]**

Where, however, a participant passenger in such an illegal "drag race,"
accidently grabs the steering wheel of a vehicle involved in the race,
instead of the gear shift he was assigned to operate, causing the
vehicle to go out of control, crash, and kill the passenger --- this
court has held that the defendant driver of the subject motor vehicle
was improperly convicted of vehicular homicide. *J.A.C. v. State,* 374
So.2d 606 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979), *rev. denied,* 383 So.2d 1203 (Fla.1980).
The court reasoned that the passenger's reckless act of grabbing the
steering wheel was an independent intervening act which superseded the
respondent's wrongful conduct in participating in the "drag race." *Id.*
at 607. Although, obviously, the respondent's participation in the
subject race was *a* "but for" cause-in-fact of the passenger's death
and such death was plainly within the scope of the danger created by the
defendant's conduct in participating in the race --- this court
nonetheless implicitly concluded that it would be unjust to hold the
defendant criminally responsible for the passenger's death because the
passenger, in effect, killed himself by his own reckless conduct.

The result reached in *J.A.C.* is in accord with the weight of
better-reasoned decisions on this subject throughout the country. These
courts have uniformly concluded that a driver-participant in an illegal
"drag race" on a public road cannot be held criminally responsible for
the death of another driver participant when (a) the deceased, in
effect, kills himself by his own reckless driving during the race, and
(b) the sole basis for attaching criminal liability for his death is the
defendant's participation in the "drag race." [**\[ ...
\]**](#X68720f82f0b5514cf7d3628207fda3835951521) The policy reasons for
reaching this result are best expressed in *State v. Petersen,* 17
Or.App. 478, 495, 522 P.2d 912, 920 (1974) (Schwab, C.J., dissenting)

Ill

Turning now to the instant case, it is clear that the defendant's
reckless operation of a motor vehicle in participating in the "drag
race" with the deceased was, technically speaking, *a* cause-in-fact of
the deceased's death under the "but for" test. But for the defendant's
participation in the subject race, the deceased would not have
recklessly raced his vehicle at all and thus would not have been killed.
However, under the authority of *J.A.C.* and the better reasoned
decisions throughout the country, the defendant's participation in the
subject "drag race" was not a proximate cause of the deceased's death
because, simply put, the deceased, in effect, killed himself by his own
volitional reckless driving---and, consequently, it would be unjust to
hold the defendant criminally responsible for this death.

The undisputed facts in this case demonstrate that the "drag race" was,
in effect, over when the defendant and the deceased had completed the
agreed-upon one-quarter mile course and had crossed the finish line.
Unexpectedly, however, the deceased suddenly whirled his vehicle around
and headed back toward the starting line and the canal which ran
perpendicular to the road on which he was travelling; although the
defendant then followed, it is plain that it was the deceased\'s sole
decision to return to the starting line, as apparently this had not
previously been agreed upon. At any rate, the deceased, who had consumed
a considerable amount of alcohol and was wearing no seat belt, attained
an estimated speed of 123 m.p.h. on his return trip; applied the brakes
as he approached the end of the road but was unable to stop; crashed
through a protective guard rail; and incredibly vaulted the entire
canal, landing on the far bank. He was thrown from his vehicle upon
impact, was pinned under the vehicle when it landed on him, and died
instantly from the resulting injuries. Although the defendant was about
one-car length in back of the deceased during the deceased's fatal
return to the starting line, the defendant at no time struck the
deceased\'s vehicle and did not physically propel it in any way across
the canal. Clearly, the deceased was on a near-suicide mission when, on
his own hook, he returned to the starting line of the race after the
race was apparently over, attaining a murderous speed of 123 m.p.h.,
vaulted a canal, and killed himself. This being so, it would be unjust
to hold the defendant criminally responsible for the deceased's
unexpected and near-suicidal conduct.

**\[ ... \]**

The state nonetheless relies on cases from other jurisdictions which
have reached a contrary result to the one we reach herein.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X7990b7ce96641e1f2f84dffde58a3da4bc3c6db) We have reviewed these
cases, but are not persuaded by their rea-soiling because we think they
lead to an unjust result. In our judgment, it is simply unfair, unjust,
and just plain wrong to say that the defendant in the instant case is
criminally responsible for the death of the deceased when it is
undisputed that the deceased, in effect, killed himself. No one forced
this young man to participate in the subject "drag race"; no one forced
him to whirl around and proceed back toward the canal after the race was
apparently over; no one forced him to travel 123 m.p.h., vault a canal,
and kill himself upon impact. He did all these things himself, and was,
accordingly, the major cause of his own death. We are constrained by law
to construe criminal statutes strictly in favor of the accused, §
775.021(1), Fla.Stat. (1989), and, given this salutary principle of
statutory construction, we are unwilling to construe our vehicular
homicide statute to impose criminal liability on the defendant under the
circumstances of this case.

The final judgment of conviction and sentence under review is reversed,
and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to grant
the defendant's motion to dismiss.

Reversed and remanded.

Before: SAWYER, PJ., and FITZGERALD and O'CONNELL, JJ.

SAWYER, P.J.

Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of operating a motor
vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) or while visibly impaired (OWVD and
thereby causing death.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xdf885f7c392a1a506418287261f2c7bb3edb807) He was sentenced to
serve 3 to 15 years in prison. He now appeals and we reverse and remand.

At 2:00 a.m. on November 23, 2003, defendant was driving his sport
utility vehicle (SUV) east on 17 Mile Road in northern Kent County. He
attempted to turn north onto Edgerton Avenue and drove into the path of
an oncoming car driven by Jason Reichelt. Reichelt's car hit defendant's
SUV and spun 180 degrees, coming to rest on the centerline of 17 Mile
Road. The SUV came to rest on the side of the road. It was later
determined that defendant had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.16,
which is twice the legal limit.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xcd63549d3b7fe7f3d995a03932bfcb1bafa9af2)

Reichelt and his passenger, Jonathan Keiser, were not seriously injured,
but Reichelt's car was severely damaged and the headlights stopped
working. Both men left the car and walked to the SUV to determine if
anyone was injured. After speaking briefly with defendant, the two men
walked back to Reichelt's car. Reichelt indicated that he was aware that
oncoming cars could hit his darkened car and that he wanted to determine
if he could turn on the flashers. As Reichelt and Keiser stood by the
car, an oncoming car driven by Tonya Welch hit Keiser, killing him.

At the center of this appeal is the issue of causation. Defendant argues
that not only did the trial court improperly instruct the jury on
causation, there was also insufficient evidence of causation to
establish defendant's guilt. Because the two issues are intertwined with
the question of what must be proven to establish causation in such a
case, we shall analyze both issues together beginning with a
determination of what the prosecutor must show to establish causation.

As the Supreme Court discussed in *People v* Schaefer,[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xa504f7bb797c6d7881e8459e635f361a1274da7) causation consists of
two components:

> In criminal jurisprudence, the causation element of an offense is
> generally comprised of two components: factual cause and proximate
> cause. The concept of factual causation is relatively straightforward.
> In determining whether a defendant's conduct is a factual cause of the
> result, one must ask, "but for" the defendant's conduct, would the
> result have occurred? If the result would not have occurred absent the
> defendant's conduct, then factual causation exists.
>
> The existence of factual causation alone, however, will not support
> the imposition of criminal liability. Proximate causation must also be
> established. As we noted in *\[People* v\] *Tims\[,* 449 Mich 83, 96;
> 534 NW2d 675 (1995)\], proximate causation is a "legal colloquialism."
> It is a legal construct designed to prevent criminal liability from
> attaching when the result of the defendant's conduct is viewed as too
> remote or unnatural. Thus, a proximate cause is simply a factual cause
> "of which the law will take cognizance."\[[**\[ ...
> \]**](#Xd2340b0ca362d6c486c577a7f52ffbd4b3dccc4)\]

We initially note that there is no dispute at this point that defendant
was intoxicated and that his driving was the cause of the initial
accident.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xd2340b0ca362d6c486c577a7f52ffbd4b3dccc4)
Furthermore, there is no argument that defendant's driving was the
factual or "but-for" cause of the second accident. This analysis is
relatively straightforward: but for defendant causing the initial
accident, the subsequent accident would not have occurred.

Of course, factual causation is relatively easy to establish. As the
court in *Welch v State* observed, "\[m\]ankind might still be in Eden,
but for Adam's biting an apple."[**\[ ...
\]**](#X234eb27e2cf46a57e3a87460769afdefb418542) But the question
whether defendant is the proximate cause of the subsequent accident, and
thus of the victim's death, is not so easily resolved. *Schaefer*
discussed this requirement in further detail:

> For a defendant's conduct to be regarded as a proximate cause, the
> victim's injury must be a "direct and natural result" of the
> defendant's actions. In making this determination, it is necessary to

> did indeed *supersede* the defendant's act as a legally significant
> causal factor, then the defendant's conduct will not be deemed a
> proximate cause of the victim's injury.
>

> At the same time, *gross* negligence or intentional misconduct by a

> death.\[[^36]\]

With these basic principles in mind, we conclude that the trial court
improperly instructed the jury on the issue of proximate cause. **\[ ...
\]**

The trial court gave detailed and extensive instructions on factual
causation, including reinforcement of the concept that defendant had to
he "a" cause of the accident, but not necessarily "the" cause of the
accident. But the trial court's instructions on proximate cause and
superseding intervening causes were virtually nonexistent. The trial
court did implicitly touch on the issue of proximate cause when it
instructed the jury that one of several causes "is a **\[ ... \]**
factor in causing a death if, but for that cause's contribution, the
death would not have occurred, unless the death was an utterly unnatural
result of whatever happened." But the instructions also told the jury
that another cause could be a superseding cause only if it was the sole
cause:

> Now it also necessarily follows that somebody else's conduct, for
> example, by Mr. Keiser, or by some third party, even if that other
> conduct was wrong or itself negligent, does not cut off criminal
> liability unless the other cause was the only cause. Obviously, if
> somebody else's conduct was the only reason Mr. Keiser died, then it
> can't possibly be something to which Mr. Rideout contributed.

This is not a correct statement of the law. **\[ ... \]** The effect of
the trial court's instructions was that the jury could convict defendant
if they found him to be a factual cause of the accident and that the
jury could find the existence of a superseding intervening cause only if
that superseding intervening cause was the only cause of the second
accident. The jury was not adequately instructed on the issues of
proximate and intervening causes.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6ad72ff45c1059f379415a8d8f3bb5f2f341593)

This conclusion is enough to set aside defendant's conviction, with
directions to the trial court to properly instruct the jury on the
causation issue. But we agree with defendant that the problem in this
case goes even deeper, because there was insufficient evidence to
establish proximate cause at all. **\[ ... \]**

The troubling aspect of this case is that the second accident only
occurred after Keiser had reached a position of safety (the side of the
road) and then chose to reenter the roadway with Reichelt to check on
the car. While foreseeability is the "linchpin" of the superseding
causation analysis,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X2abb260bb2510ba4a8e884bd6d865c796c3e39e) and it is at least
arguably foreseeable that a person involved in an accident would check
on his or her vehicle even if it remains on the road, the analysis does
not end there. As Professor Dressier discusses in *Understanding
Criminal Law* (3d ed),[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6d12cb425036dde20de3aaeb1c433aefa78b30c)there is no universal
test for determining if an intervening cause is also a superseding
cause:

> One early twentieth century scholar observed that all efforts to set
> down universal tests that explain the law of causation are
> "demonstrably erroneous." \[Jeremiah Smith, *Legal Cause in Actions
> of* Tort, 25 Harv L R 223, 317 (1912).\] There are no hard-and-fast
> rules for determining when an intervening cause supersedes the
> defendant's conduct. However, there are various factors that assist
> the factfinder in the evaluative process.

Indeed, Dressier[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd77f92fae11e2f00c1e46045c23aef358b58001) points out that to say
that foreseeability is the "linchpin" is "a slight overstatement,"
though it is of great significance. Rather, Dressier[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd06cc90886d58284a3ae92c788b3ababcbc2a25) discusses six factors
to be considered in determining if an intervening cause is a superseding
cause.

Of the six factors discussed by Dressier, three are not relevant here.
They are the (1) *de minimis* contribution to social harm factor, (2)
the intended-consequences doctrine, and (3) the omissions factor.[**\[
... \]**](#X9cf8ef1937f61f39892836b7c49b954d53a003e) The foreseeability
factor is relevant here, but its application is less than clear. As
Dressier points out, a responsive intervening cause will establish
proximate cause, while a coincidental intervening cause will not unless
it was foreseeable.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xb7c66232cb83445e5747fdbecb4b0d09bacb05a)In discussing responsive
intervening causes, Dressier points to the examples of a passenger in a
capsized boat drowning while attempting to swim to shore and a wounded
victim being negligently treated and dying. That is, the harm results
from actions taken in response to the defendant's conduct. A
coincidental intervening cause would exist, for example, where the
defendant's conduct put the victim in the "wrong place at the wrong
time," such as an assault victim who is attacked by a "knife-wielding
maniac" while waiting in the emergency room for treatment of the initial
wounds.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xb5e9425485a5f05e3a53723dfa3d675d0bf90dc)

Whether the intervening cause is responsive or coincidental in the case
at bar is arguable at best. On the one hand, the victim reentering the
roadway to check on the vehicle was in direct response to the accident,
though not in direct response to defendant's having driven. On the other
hand, Welch's driving down the road when she did was entirely
coincidental.

In our view, Reiser's decision to reenter the roadway renders the
foreseeability factor of little value to the analysis. Rather, that
decision directly involves the two remaining factors identified by
Dressier that are present here. Those two factors, we believe, compel
the conclusion that the intervening cause of the second accident was
also a superseding cause.

First, there is the apparent-safety doctrine, which Dressier describes
as follows:

> One scholar has observed that when a "defendant's active force has
> come to rest in a position of apparent safety, the court will follow
> it no longer." \[Joseph H. Beale, *The Proximate Consequences of an
> Act,* 33 Harv L R 633, 651 (1920).\] For example, consider a somewhat
> simplified version of the facts in *State v Preslar* \[48 NC 421
> (1856)\]: *D* threatened the life of *V,* his spouse. As a
> consequence, *V* was forced to leave the house on a freezing night in
> order to protect herself. *V* walked to within 200 yards of her
> father's home, where she would have been welcome, but she chose to

Similarly, in the case at bar, Reiser had reached a position of apparent
safety: he had gotten out of the vehicle and was alongside the road, off
the pavement. Had the second accident occurred before Reiser could
extricate himself from the Reichelt vehicle and get to the side of the
road, then the causal chain would have been intact. But he was able to
get out of harm's way and to a relatively safe position at the side of
the road. He then made the choice to return to the roadway and place
himself in a more dangerous position. Like the victim in *Preslar,*
Reiser made a decision regarding his actions after the immediate danger
was over. And that decision, like the decision in *Preslar,* ended the
initial causal chain and started a new one, one for which defendant was
not responsible.

The point of a person making a decision brings us to the remaining
factor discussed in Dressier, that of voluntary human intervention:

> A defendant is far more apt to be relieved of criminal responsibility
> in the case of a "free, deliberate, and informed" \[Hart & Honoré,
> Causation in the Law (2d ed 1985), p 326\] --- a voluntary, knowing,
> and intelligent--- human agent than in the case of an intervention of
> a natural force or the actions of a person whose conduct is not fully
> free. The result in the *Preslar* case, described \[above\], can be
> explained in terms of this factor. *V* chose to sleep in the cold
> rather than to enter her father's home. Her decision was free,
> deliberate, and with full knowledge of the fact that it was
> exceedingly cold outside. Under these circumstances, the
> responsibility for her death is shifted from *D* to *V.* This outcome
> is consistent with the retributive principle that accords special
> significance to the freewill actions of human agents.\[[^37]\]

Similarly, in the case at bar, Reiser made the voluntary decision to
return to the vehicle on the roadway, despite the danger that it posed.
He could have chosen to remain on the side of the road. He chose instead
to reenter the roadway, with the danger of standing in the roadway next
to an unlit vehicle in the middle of the night being readily apparent.

In sum, we conclude that the prosecution failed to present sufficient
evidence to establish that defendant's actions were a proximate cause of
Reiser's death. Therefore, we vacate defendant's conviction for OWI/OWVT
causing death.

Homicide Statistics

 

            According to a [2019 global
study](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/gsh/Booklet1.pdf)
on homicide produced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC), homicide rates have been declining steadily over the last 25
years.[^\[1\]^](#Xe5536b9f16ed937f92a62a5ddf9e3f419625500) Globally, the
homicide rate in 2017 per 100,000 is 6.1 victims. Broken down by region,
the Americas had the highest homicide rates at 17.2 victims per 100,000
population.  Africa comes in second at 13 victims per 100,000
population, while Asia, Europe, and Oceania saw between 2.3 and 3
victims per 100,000 population.

            Within the United States alone, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation reports in its [Crime Data
Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/explorer/national/united-states/shr)
that in 2018, there were 14,504 homicides. Of those victims, 77% were
male, whereas only 23% were female. African-Americans comprised 52% of
victims and whites made up 43%.

[^\[1\]^](#X6ce1695c70334d171bb7c5fc18a6cafd0623ccf) UNODC notes that
this decline can be attributed to the fact that "the increase in the
global population has been higher than the increase in the overall
number of homicide victims recorded worldwide."

Model Penal Code Commentaries, Comment to § 210.2

 

**American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to
§ 210.2**

(1980), 13--16.

1\. *Common-Law Background.* At common law, murder was defined as the
unlawful killing of another human being with "malice aforethought."
Whatever the original meaning of that phrase, it became over time an
"arbitrary symbol" used by judges to signify any of a number of mental
states deemed sufficient to support liability for murder. Successive
generations added new content to "malice aforethought" until it
encompassed a variety of mental attitudes bearing no predictable
relation to the ordinary sense of the two words. Even today, judges find
in the elasticity of this ancient formula a convenient vehicle for
announcing new departures in the law of homicide.

Various authorities have given different summaries of the several
meanings of "malice aforethought." Generally, these definitions converge
on four constituent states of mind. First and foremost, there was intent
to kill. Common-law authorities included in the notion of intent to kill
awareness that the death of another would result from one's actions,
even if the actor had no particular desire to achieve such a
consequence. Thus, intentional or knowing homicide was murder unless the
actor killed in the heat of passion engendered by adequate provocation,
in which case the crime was manslaughter. A second species of murder
involved intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Again, knowledge that
conduct would cause serious bodily injury was generally assimilated to
intent and was deemed sufficient for murder if death of another actually
resulted. A third category of murder was sometimes called depraved-heart
murder. This label derived from decisions and statutes condemning as
murder unintentional homicide under circumstances evincing a "depraved
mind" or an "abandoned and malignant heart." Older authorities may have
described such circumstances as giving rise to an "implied" or
"presumed" intent to kill or injure, but the essential concept was one
of extreme recklessness regarding homicidal risk. Thus, a person might
be liable for murder absent any actual intent to kill or injure if he
caused the death of another in a manner exhibiting a "wanton and wilful
disregard of an unreasonable human risk" or, in confusing elaboration, a
"wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of
consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty." The fourth kind of
murder was based on intent to commit a felony. This is the origin of the
felony-murder rule, which assigns strict liability for homicide
committed during the commission of a felony. These four states of mind
exhausted the meaning of "malice aforethought"; the phrase had no
residual content.

2\. *Antecedent Statutory Variations.* Prior to the recodification
effort begun by the Model Penal Code, most American jurisdictions
maintained a law of murder built around these common-law
classifications. The most significant departure was the division of
murder into degrees, a change initiated by the Pennsylvania legislation
of 1794. That statute provided that "all murder, which shall be
perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other
kind of willful, deliberate \[and\] premeditated killing, or which shall
be committed in the perpetration, or attempt to perpetrate any arson,
rape, robbery or burglary shall be deemed murder in the first degree;
and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second
degree." The thrust of this reform was to confine the death penalty,
which was then mandatory on conviction of any common-law murder, to
homicides judged particularly heinous. Other states followed the
Pennsylvania practice until at one time the vast majority of American
jurisdictions differentiated degrees of murder and the term
"first-degree murder" passed into common parlance.

Leaving the question of felony-murder aside, the extent to which the
common law had been modified in other ways prior to the drafting of the
Model Penal Code varied considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Model Penal Code Commentaries, Comment to § 210.3

 

 

**American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to
§ 210.3**

(1980), 44--46.

1\. *Common-Law Background.* Initially, the common law did not
distinguish murder from manslaughter. Early statutes, however, sought to
differentiate among criminal homicides for the purpose of withdrawing
benefit of clergy from the more heinous killings. This initiative led to
the division of criminal homicides into murder, which retained its
status as a capital crime, and the lesser offense of manslaughter. The
courts defined murder in terms of the evolving concept of "malice
aforethought" and treated manslaughter as a residual category for all
other criminal homicides. Thus, in its classic formulation, manslaughter
consisted of homicide without malice aforethought on the one hand and
without justification or excuse on the other.

Traditional statements of the English law as it further evolved divided
the offense into two types. First, homicide, even if intentional, was
said to be without malice and hence manslaughter if committed in the
heat of passion upon adequate provocation. Second, homicide was also
manslaughter if it resulted from an act that was regarded as unduly
dangerous to life or limb or from an act that was otherwise unlawful.
This category thus encompassed conduct that was insufficiently reckless
or negligent to constitute "depraved-heart" murder but at the same time
exhibited culpability greater than needed for ordinary conceptions of
civil negligence. It also included cases where the actor caused the
death of another in the commission of an unlawful act, sometimes
described as the misdemeanor-manslaughter analogue to the felony-murder
rule. Courts commonly referred to the first category as voluntary
manslaughter and the second as involuntary manslaughter, although the
distinction had no grading significance at common law.

2\. *Antecedent Statutory Variations.* Virtually every state recognized
the crime of manslaughter at the time the Model Penal Code was drafted.
The largest number contained no explicit definition of the offense and
hence determined its content by reference to the common law. There were
also a few states, typified by Florida, that carried forward the
substance of the common-law offense by defining manslaughter as "the
killing of a human being by the act, procurement or culpable negligence
of another where such killing shall not be justifiable or excusable
homicide nor murder." A more common variation was reflected in the
federal manslaughter provision:

Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. It
is of two kinds:

Voluntary---Upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.

Involuntary---In the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a
felony, or in the commission in an unlawful manner, or without due
caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might produce death.

Statutes that followed this pattern typically departed from the common
law by providing a grading differential between voluntary and
involuntary manslaughter.

## CA Penal Code § 187

\(a\) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with
malice aforethought.

**\[ ... \]**

## A Penal Code § 188

Such malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is
manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a
fellow creature. It is implied, when no considerable provocation
appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an
abandoned and malignant heart.

When it is shown that the killing resulted from the intentional doing of
an act with express or implied malice as defined above, no other mental
state need be shown to establish the mental state of malice
aforethought. Neither an awareness of the obligation to act within the
general body of laws regulating society nor acting despite such
awareness is included within the definition of malice.

## CA Penal Code § 189

All murder which is perpetrated by means of a destructive device or
explosive, a weapon of mass destruction, knowing use of ammunition
designed primarily to penetrate metal or armor, poison, lying in wait,
torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated
killing, or which is committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to
perpetrate, arson, rape, carjacking, robbery, burglary, mayhem,
kidnapping, train wrecking, or any act punishable under Section 206,
286, 288, 288a, or 289, or any murder which is perpetrated by means of
discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, intentionally at another
person outside of the vehicle with the intent to inflict death, is
murder of the first degree. All other kinds of murders are of the second
degree.

As used in this section, \"destructive device\" means any destructive
device as defined in Section 16460, and explosive\" means any explosive
as defined in Section 12000 of the Health and Safety Code.

As used in this section, \"weapon of mass destruction\" means any item
defined in Section 11417.

To prove the killing was \"deliberate and premeditated,\" it shall not
be necessary to prove the defendant maturely and meaningfully reflected
upon the gravity of his or her act.

## CA Penal Code § 189.5

\(a\) Upon a trial for murder, the commission of the homicide by the
defendant being proved, the burden of proving circumstances of
mitigation, or that justify or excuse it, devolves upon the defendant,
unless the proof on the part of the prosecution tends to show that the
crime committed only amounts to manslaughter, or that the defendant was
justifiable or excusable.

> or vehicular accident was knowingly caused for financial gain and
> proximately resulted in the death of any person. This provision shall
> not be construed to prevent prosecution of a defendant for the crime
> of murder.

This section shall not be construed as making any homicide in the
driving of a vehicle punishable that is not a proximate result of the
commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony, or of the
commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful
manner.

\"Gross negligence,\" as used in this section, shall not be construed as
prohibiting or precluding a charge of murder under Section 188 upon
facts exhibiting wantonness and a conscious disregard for life to
support a finding of implied malice, or upon facts showing malice,
consistent with the holding of the California Supreme Court in People v.
Watson, 30 Cal. 3d 290.

## CA Penal Code § 192.5 

Vehicular manslaughter pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 191.5 and
subdivision (c) of Section 192 is the unlawful killing of a human being
without malice aforethought, and includes:

> \(a\) Operating a vessel in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d),
> (e), or (f) of Section 655 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, and in
> the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony, and with
> gross negligence; or operating a vessel in violation of subdivision
> (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655 of the Harbors and
> Navigation Code, and in the commission of a lawful act that might
> produce death, in an unlawful manner, and with gross negligence.
>
> \(b\) Operating a vessel in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d),
> (e), or (f) of Section 655 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, and in
> the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony, but
> without gross negligence; or operating a vessel in violation of
> subdivision (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of Section 655 of the Harbors
> and Navigation Code, and in the commission of a lawful act that might
> produce death, in an unlawful manner, but without gross negligence.
>
> \(c\) Operating a vessel in the commission of an unlawful act, not
> amounting to a felony, and with gross negligence; or operating a
> vessel in the commission of a lawful act that might produce death, in

> \(d\) Operating a vessel in the commission of an unlawful act, not
> amounting to a felony, but without gross negligence; or operating a
> vessel in the commission of a lawful act that might produce death, in

>
> \(e\) A person who flees the scene of the crime after committing a
> violation of subdivision (a), (b), or (c), upon conviction, in

> causes the death of such officer or another police officer or peace
> officer under circumstances which do not constitute murder because he
> or she acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, as

Teaching Memo on Intentional Homicide

 

By Angela Madrigal, Cydney Chilimidos, and Zachary Nemirovsky

**[*State v. Guthrie* and its notes]{.underline}**

            *State v. Guthrie* is a 1995 case coming out of the Supreme
Court of Appeals of West Virginia which serves to encapsulate the
difference between the elements of first and second degree murder by
explaining that in order to support a first degree murder charge,
premeditation must be established before the homicidal act takes place.
In contrast with the trial court's decision, the appellate court
clarifies that premeditation demands more than mere *intent*; instead,
the defendant must be *fully conscious* of what he or she intended. It
further explains that premeditation can be instantaneous, and this case
provides a good basis for classroom discussions about whether or not
Guthrie's removal of gloves before killing his coworker satisfies the
premeditation element. We support keeping this case in the course
curriculum. However, we are suggesting adding supplemental reading to
discuss the intersection between mental illness and the criminal justice
system, since the case includes details of the defendant's psychiatric
problems---including depression, body dysmorphia, and borderline
personality disorder.

            We flagged this case because, while Guthrie's mental illness
was described, there was no real discussion regarding its significance,
even though nearly 15% of men and 30% of women booked into jails live
with serious mental
illness.[^\[1\]^](#X8b577bf4002566f14e6a08301a5f58416c5d025) Despite
these large numbers, the vast majority of these individuals are booked
into jails for nonviolent
crimes.[^\[2\]^](#Xaef8bb3899f127aeb4fcc38080f0071c47bec7b) While we
think that the *Guthrie* case should be kept because of the usefulness
of its explanation of premeditation, we support a broader discussion of
mental health and how the justice system treats those with mental
illnesses. One article we found touches on how prisons are often the
most accessible mental health resources for many individuals, and offers
the solution of "mental health courts, \[which are\] a form of
collaborative court based on the highly successful drug court model that
provides services and treatments to participants while emphasizing
collaborative problem solving between all
parties."[^\[3\]^](#X65f49b40068057cc34422104cdee1163212d40b) While not
a perfect solution, it paves the way for a conversation where students/
future lawyers can begin developing thoughts about how to help
contribute to creating a better system.

            For students who may be interested in a deeper dive into the
implications of incarcerating individuals with mental health disorders
in facilities that are overwhelmed with inmates and are improperly
trained to handle inmates with mental health needs, the article
"Mentally Ill Individuals in Jails and Prisons," might be interesting.
It expands on how individuals with mental illness are processed in the
criminal justice system and discusses steps we can take to make
meaningful change.[^\[4\]^](#X3dcf6de77f75ecd73b4c0d01faa95d93527bb42)
This article might be too long to add as required reading, but it brings
up some interesting policy proposals for those who are inclined to
pursue criminal justice in their legal career. Therefore, it may be
offered to students as optional supplemental reading.

**[*Midgett v. State* and its notes]{.underline}**

            *Midgett v. State* is a particularly troubling case emerging
from the Supreme Court of Arkansas in 1987. We flagged this case because
of its extreme description of horrific child abuse. However, despite
this, we have decided not to remove this for a combination of two
reasons.

Firstly, the case is part of a trio (*State v. Guthrie, Midgett,* and
*State v. Forrest*) that are meant to work together to achieve the
particular ends of showing that moral culpability or blameworthiness
unfortunately does not always map onto legal culpability and punishment.
*Guthrie* provides the students, first and foremost, with the groundwork
of premeditation, and secondly with an example of a case where the
result is "right" in the sense that the higher court reversed the
first-degree conviction and ordered a new trial. *Forrest* shows a
"wrong" result, where a killing done for sympathetic reasons by someone
who shows no malice (in the colloquial, not legal, sense of the word) is
nonetheless considered first-degree due to the clear element of
premeditation. And *Midgett* showcases a "wrong" result in the opposite
direction \-- a heinous killing that deserved a first-degree conviction,
is nonetheless deemed only second-degree due to (what the Court deems) a
lack of premeditation. As such, if *Midgett* were replaced, it would
have to be with another case that was also disturbing in some way but
legally does not amount to first-degree murder. This was because the
facts (though not necessarily the fact pattern) must sufficiently invoke
our moral sensibilities and, as Professor W. David Ball said, "find
\[our\] inner retributivist" in order to be effectively contrasted with
*Forrest*.

Secondly, it must be said that we cannot simply remove every case that
talks about or describes child abuse. It is an unfortunate reality that,
a student who wishes to pursue criminal law as a profession, is likely
to run across child abuse at some point another. The painful and
difficult issues, and nuances behind, child abuse are important things
to discuss.

As such, rather than remove *Midgett* entirely, we have decided to
redact some of the more disturbing parts of the fact pattern. This
redaction is a delicate process. Redact too little, and the fact pattern
remains unnecessarily disturbing and makes it difficult for a student to
actually engage with the issues it presents. Redact too much, and risk
that *Midgett* becomes no worse than any other defendant convicted of
murder. If too many of the facts are lost, the intuitive response that
the defendant deserved worse than he got may also be lost. Additionally,
some paragraphs that we might wish to redact must remain intact to
convey important issues. For example, the second paragraph of the case
in the casebook prompts a discussion about how abuse is rarely
distributed equally - rather, a parent often targets a specific child
for abuse.[^\[6\]^](#X6bd8ed3e4c1b7600c13a667d7cbdd3780f7d59c) Lastly,
legal reasoning in the case is left undisturbed in part because it
provides students an opportunity (in conjunction with the notes
following *Forrest*) to consider under what circumstances we can infer
premeditation.

In the end, consistent with these concerns, the third and fourth
paragraphs of the opinion printed in Dressler's casebook were heavily
redacted (the fourth paragraph being nearly entirely deleted). The rest
of the opinion remains intact, but it is our hope that without those
especially graphic pieces, the case will be significantly easier for
students to read - while still conveying disconnect between
blameworthiness and legal culpability.

**[*State v. Forrest* and its notes]{.underline}**

*State v. Forrest* is a 1987 case coming out of the Supreme Court of
North Carolina shows that premeditation can be inferred through the
analysis of both circumstantial evidence and/or steps taken before the
homicide takes place. Like *Guthrie*, we recognize that the benefits of
reading this case are substantial and support keeping it in the
curriculum because it shows that benevolent intentions do not matter in
mitigating a charge, as long as the elements of the charge are
satisfied. This case also serves to work as a triad with *Guthrie* and
*Midgett* to show that satisfaction of the elements of the statutes
matters more in regard to how punishment is meted out than
blameworthiness.[^\[7\]^](#Xd201313372d4f210451bce89fe34c4adfea9047)

            While we support keeping *Forrest* with no changes because
of what it adds to the other cases in the intentional killings section
of the course, we do think this case merits a brief discussion about
whether or not benevolent intent should be a factor when considering how
to charge the perpetrator of a crime. The aphorism "the road to hell is
paved with good intentions" strikes us as particularly relevant to this
case because while Forrest intended to put his father out of his misery,
he still committed murder. Because intent is such a large part of
securing a conviction in criminal law, it seems beneficial to discuss
how a lack of access to legal knowledge can lead some individuals to
believe that an illegal action with good intentions should lead to a
lessened sentence, when that is very much not the case.

State. v. Guthrie

 

Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia

194 W. Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163

No. 22710

1995-07-19

**\[ ... \]**

### STATE of West Virginia, Plaintiff Below, Appellee, v. Dale Edward GUTHRIE, Defendant Below, Appellant.

No. 22710.

Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.

Submitted May 10, 1995.

Decided July 19, 1995.

**\[ ... \]**

\[170\] CLECKLEY, Justice:

The defendant, Dale Edward Guthrie, appeals the January, 1994, jury
verdict of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County finding him guilty of
first degree murder. In May of 1994, the defendant was sentenced to
serve a life sentence with a recommendation of mercy. **\[ ... \]**

## I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

It is undisputed that on the evening of February 12, 1993, the defendant
removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed his co-worker, Steven Todd
Farley, in the neck and killed him. The two men worked together as
dishwashers at Danny\'s Rib House in Nitro and got along well together
before this incident. On the night of the killing, the victim, his
brother, Tracy Farley, and James Gibson were joking around while working
in the kitchen of the restaurant. The victim was poking fun at the
defendant who appeared to be in a bad mood. He told the defendant to
\"lighten up\" and snapped him with a dishtowel several times.
Apparently, the victim had no idea he was upsetting the defendant very
much. The dishtowel flipped the defendant on the nose and he became
enraged.

The defendant removed his gloves and started toward the victim. Mr.
Farley, still teasing, said: \"Ooo, he\'s taking his gloves off.\" The
defendant then pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the victim in
the neck. He also stabbed Mr. Farley in the arm as he fell to the floor.
Mr. Farley looked up and cried: \"Man, I was just kidding around.\" The
defendant responded: \"Well, man, you should have never hit me in my
face.\" **\[ ... \]**

It is also undisputed that the defendant suffers from a host of
psychiatric problems. He experiences up to two panic attacks daily and
had received treatment for them at the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Huntington for more than a year preceding the killing. He suffers
from chronic depression (dysthymic disorder), an obsession with his nose
(body dysmorphic disorder), and borderline personality disorder. The
defendant\'s father shed some light on his nose fixation. He stated that
dozens of times a day the defendant stared in the mirror and turned his
head back and forth to look at his nose. His father estimated that 50
percent of the time he observed his son he was looking at his nose. The
defendant repeatedly asked for assurances that his nose was not too big.
This obsession began when he was approximately seventeen years old. The
defendant was twenty-nine years old at the time of trial.

The defendant testified he suffered a panic attack immediately preceding
the stabbing. He described the attack as \"intense\"; he felt a lot of
pressure and his heart beat rapidly. In contrast to the boisterous
atmosphere in the kitchen that evening, the defendant was quiet and kept
to himself. He stated that Mr. Farley kept irritating him that night.
The defendant could not understand why Mr. Farley was picking on him
because he had never done that before. Even at trial, the defendant did
not comprehend his utter overreaction to the situation. In hindsight,
the defendant believed the better decision would have been to punch out
on his time card and quit over the incident. However, all the witnesses
related that the defendant was in no way attacked, as he perceived it,
but that Mr. Farley was playing around. The defendant could not bring
himself to tell the other workers to leave him alone or inform them
about his panic attacks.

**\[ ... \]**

The principal question before us under this assignment of error is
whether our instructions on murder when given together deprive a
criminal defendant of due process or are otherwise wrong and confusing.
**\[ ... \]**

State\'s Instruction No. 8**\[ ... \]** stated:

> \"The Court instructs the jury that to constitute a willful,
> deliberate and premeditated killing, it is not necessary that the
> intention to kill should exist for any particular length of time prior
> to the actual killing; it is only necessary that such intention should
> have come into existence for the first time at the time of such
> killing, or at any time previously.\"

*See* *State v. Clifford,* 59 W.Va. 1, 52 S.E. 981 (1906). State\'s
Instruction No. 10 stated:

\[179\] \"The Court instructs the jury that in order to constitute a
\`premeditated\' murder an intent to kill need exist only for an
instant.\" State\'s Instruction No. 12 stated: \"The Court instructs the
jury that what is meant by the language willful, deliberate and
premeditated is that the killing be intentional.\"**\[ ... \]***See*
*State v. Schrader,* 172 W.Va. 1, 302 S.E.2d 70 (1982).

The linchpin of the problems that flow from these instructions is the
failure adequately to inform the jury of the difference between first
and second degree murder. Of particular concern is the lack of guidance
to the jury as to what constitutes premeditation and the manner in which
the instructions infuse premeditation with the intent to kill.

At common law, murder was defined as the unlawful killing of another
human being with \"malice aforethought.\" Because the common law
definition of \"malice aforethought\" was extremely flexible, \"it
became over time an \`arbitrary symbol\' used by trial judges to signify
any of the number of mental states deemed sufficient to support
liability for murder.\" **\[ ...
\]**.[^\[21\]^](#Xf7042bc2361d886c15e1c7ac0f4f7d6b14cacad)

**\[ ... \]**

In *State v. Hatfield,* 169 W.Va. 191, 286 S.E .2d 402 (1982), we made
an effort to distinguish the degrees of murder by indicating that the
elements that separate first degree murder and second degree murder are
deliberation and premeditation in addition to \[180\] the formation of
the specific intent to kill. Deliberation and premeditation mean to
reflect upon the intent to kill and make a deliberate choice to carry it
out. Although no particular amount of time is required, there must be at
least a sufficient period to permit the accused to actually consider in
his or her mind the plan to kill. In this sense, murder in the first
degree is a calculated killing as opposed to a spontaneous event. After
noting the above language in *Dodds,* Justice Miller stated in
*Hatfield:*

> **\[ ... \]**
>
> \"\`To be guilty of this form of first degree murder the defendant
> must not only intend to kill but in addition he must premeditate the
> killing and deliberate about it. It is not easy to give a meaningful
> definition of the words \"premeditate\" and \"deliberate\" as they are
> used in connection with first degree murder. Perhaps the best that can
> be said of \"deliberation\" is that it requires a cool mind that is
> capable of reflection, and of \"premeditation\" that it requires that
> the one with the cool mind did in fact reflect, at least for a short
> period of time before his act of killing.\' (Footnotes omitted)
>
> **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The source of the problem in the present case stems from language in
*State v. Schrader,* 172 W.Va. 1, 302 S.E.2d 70 (1982). While this Court
elaborated on the meaning of premeditation, we gave it a different
definition than that approved in *Hatfield* and *Dodds.* In *Schrader,*
we stated:

> \"Hence, when the West Virginia Legislature adopted the Virginia
> murder statute in 1868, the meaning of \`premeditated\' as used in the
> statute was essentially \`knowing\' and \`intentional.\' Since then,
> courts have consistently recognized that the mental process necessary
> to constitute \`willful, deliberate and premeditated\' murder can be
> accomplished very quickly or even in the proverbial \`twinkling of an
> eye.\' \... *The achievement of a, mental state contemplated in a
> statute such as ours can immediately precede the act of killing.
> Hence, what is really meant by the language \`willful, deliberate and
> premeditated\' in W.Va. Code, 61-2-1 \[1923\] is that the killing be
> intentional\"* 172 W.Va. at 6, 302 S.E.2d at 75. (Emphasis added).

**\[ ... \]**

we believe within the parameters of our current homicide statutes the
*Schroder* definition of premeditation and deliberation is confusing, if
not meaningless. To allow the State to prove premeditation and
deliberation by only showing that the intention came \"into existence
for the first time at the time of such killing\" completely eliminates
the distinction between the two degrees of murder. Hence, we feel
compelled in this case to attempt to make the dichotomy meaningful by
making some modifications to our homicide common law.

**\[ ... \]** Although premeditation and deliberation are not measured
by any particular period of time, there must be some period between the
formation of the intent to kill and the actual killing, which indicates
the killing is by prior calculation and design. **\[ ... \]**Although an
elaborate plan or scheme to take life is not required, our *Schroder*\`s
notion of instantaneous premeditation and momentary deliberation is not
satisfactory for proof of first degree murder. **\[ ... \]**

Thus, there must be some evidence that the defendant considered and
weighed his decision to kill in order for the State to establish
premeditation and deliberation under our first degree murder
statute.[^\[23\]^](#Xe136bec3409791bc735f41336b830ce78a87e98) This is
what \[182\] is meant by a ruthless, cold-blooded, calculating killing.
Any other intentional killing, by its spontaneous and nonreflective
nature, is second degree
murder.[^\[24\]^](#X62ad4203d6bca27ce5a0e03177e34d7b73c281c)

**\[ ... \]**we agree with the defendant that the language in our
opinion in *Schrader* virtually eliminates the distinction in this State
between first and second degree murder, equating as it does
premeditation with the formation of the intent to kill. **\[ ... \]**We
find that *Schrader* wrongly equated premeditation with intent to kill
and in so doing undermined the more meaningful language of *Hatfield*
and *Dodds.* To the extent that the *Schrader* opinion is inconsistent
with our holding today, it is overruled. **\[ ... \]**

Finally, we feel obligated to discuss what instruction defining
premeditation is now acceptable. What came about as a mere suggestion in
*Hatfield,* we now approve as a proper instruction under today\'s
decision. **\[ ... \]**

> \"\`The jury is instructed that murder in the first degree consists of
> an intentional, deliberate and premeditated killing which means that
> the killing is done after a period of time for prior consideration.
> The duration of that period cannot be arbitrarily fixed. The time in
> which to form a deliberate and premeditated design varies as the minds
> and temperaments of people differ, and according to the circumstances
> in which they may be placed. Any interval of time between the forming
> of the intent to kill and the execution of that intent, which is of
> sufficient duration for the accused to be fully conscious of what he
> \[183\] intended, is sufficient to support a conviction for first
> degree murder.\'\"

County is reversed, and this case is remanded for a new trial.

three categories: (1) \"planning\" activity---facts regarding the
defendant\'s behavior prior to the killing which might indicate a design
to take life; (2) facts about the defendant\'s prior relationship or
behavior with the victim which might indicate a motive to kill; and (3)
evidence regarding the nature or manner of the killing which indicate a
deliberate intention to kill according to a preconceived design. The
California courts evidently require evidence of all three categories or
at least extremely strong evidence of planning activity or evidence of
category (2) in conjunction with either (1) or (3). *See* *People v.
Anderson.* 70 Cal.2d 15, 73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942 (1968). These

Notes & Questions (State v. Guthrie)

 

 

**Notes and Questions**

1.      *The Case and its Aftermath*. Following Guthrie's second trial,
he was again convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in
prison with the possibility of
parole.[^\[1\]^](#Xda366726e9ff1f82df12c3e06e74042bbd40b0a) He then made
a subsequent appeal in 1997, which was denied by the Court.

Guthrie has been denied parole three times (2003, 2006, and 2009) since
becoming eligible. The National Organization of Parents of Murdered
Children, Inc. has been involved in Guthrie's parole denial. This
organization strives to "give survivors a sense of control, as well as a
positive outlet for the anger, frustration and disillusionment with the
criminal justice system." It allows parents of murdered children "to
participate in the parole process by attempting to keep murderers behind
bars for their minimum sentence, thus protecting society from potential
repeat offenders."[^\[2\]^](#X0ea19093a8dbdc46a23f2e1b4a2ced3b449b959)

2.     *Degree of Homicide.* Consider the elements required for both
first and second degree murder. Based on the facts of this case, of
which degree homicide do *you* think Guthrie was guilty?

*3.   Mental Health and the Criminal Justice System*. As you read in the
*Guthrie* case, the defendant suffered "from a host of psychiatric
problems," including panic attacks, chronic depression, body dysmorphic
disorder, and borderline personality disorder. According to the National
Alliance on Mental Illness, nearly 15% of men and 30% of women booked
into jails live with serious mental
illness.[^\[3\]^](#Xd7c5f6883e2a9edc105174a939f7c0c2960fe36) Despite
these large numbers, the vast majority of these individuals are booked
into jails for nonviolent
crimes.[^\[4\]^](#X94662087b699957de18d8ffae2d1ef42161176a) Once in
jail, many individuals are denied proper mental health treatment and end
up getting worse, instead of better. Considering that people
experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to encounter police
than receive medical help, how do you think the criminal justice system
could change to better care for people experiencing mental health
crises?

One article offers the solution of "mental health courts, \[which are\]
a form of collaborative court based on the highly successful drug court
model that provides services and treatments to participants while
emphasizing collaborative problem solving between all
parties."[^\[5\]^](#X11df41fdb787daf1593085ba19fc3205c8370eb) While not
a perfect solution, it paves the way for a conversation where future
lawyers can begin developing thoughts about how to help contribute to
creating a better system.

4.      *Supplemental Reading*. For students who may be interested in a
deeper dive into the implications of incarcerating individuals with
mental health disorders in facilities that are overwhelmed with inmates
and are improperly trained to handle inmates with mental health needs,
the article "Mentally Ill Individuals in Jails and Prisons," is
interesting. It expands on how individuals with mental illness are
processed in the criminal justice system and discusses steps we can take
to make meaningful
change.[^\[6\]^](#Xa54575ab802af5b7b4aa424d1d590070db88555) This article
brings up some interesting policy proposals for those who are inclined
to pursue criminal justice in their legal career.

*5.      The Doctrine of Lesser Included Offenses*. This is defined as
"a less serious crime that is necessarily committed during the
perpetration of a greater crime because the lesser crime contains some
of the same elements of the greater crime. The greater crime cannot be
proven unless all of the elements of the lesser crime are
proven."[^\[7\]^](#X874537b5d0d2bd044f5db7d19c3d7414085096c)

Midgett v. State

 

Arkansas Supreme Court

292 Ark. 278, 729 S.W.2d 410

CR 86-215

1987-05-25

729 S.W.2d 410

**\[ ... \]**

Newbern, Justice.

This child abuse case resulted in the appellant's conviction of first
degree murder. The sole issue on appeal is whether the state's evidence
was sufficient to sustain the conviction. We hold there was no evidence
of the ". . . premeditated and deliberated purpose of causing the death
of another person . . ." required for conviction of first degree murder
by Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1502(l)(b) (Repl. 1977). However, we find the
evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction of second degree murder,
described in Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1503(l)(c) (Repl. 1977), as the
appellant was shown to have caused his son's death by delivering a blow
to his abdomen or chest ". . . with the purpose of causing serious
physical injury. . . ." The conviction is thus modified from one of
first degree murder to one of second degree murder and affirmed.

The facts of this case are as heart-rending as any we are likely to see.
The appellant is six feet two inches tall and weighs 300 pounds. His
son, Ronnie Midgett, Jr., was eight years old and weighed between
thirty-eight and forty-five pounds. The evidence showed that Ronnie Jr.
had been abused by brutal beating over a substantial period of time.
Typically, as in other child abuse cases, the bruises had been noticed
by school personnel, and a school counselor **\[ ... \]**had gone to the
Midgett home to inquire. Ronnie Jr. would not say how he had obtained
the bruises or why he was so lethargic at school except to blame it all,
vaguely, on a rough playing little brother. He did not even complain to
his siblings about the treatment he was receiving from the appellant.
His mother, the wife of the appellant, was not living in the home. The
other children apparently were not being physically abused by the
appellant.

Ronnie Jr.'s sister, Sherry, aged ten, testified that on the Saturday
preceding the Wednesday of Ronnie Jr.'s death their father, the
appellant, was drinking whiskey (two to three quarts that day) and
beating on Ronnie Jr. **\[ ... \]**

On the Wednesday Ronnie Jr. died, the appellant appeared at a hospital
carrying the body. He told hospital personnel something was wrong with
the child. An autopsy was performed, and it showed Ronnie Jr. was a very
poorly nourished and underdeveloped eight-year-old. **\[ ... \]**

The conclusion of the medical examiner who performed the autopsy was
that Ronnie Jr. died as the result of intra-abdominal hemorrhage caused
by a blunt force trauma consistent with having been delivered by a human
fist. The appellant argues that in spite of all this evidence of child
abuse, there is no evidence that he killed Ronnie Jr. having
premeditated and deliberated causing his death. We must agree.

**\[ ... \]**

The evidence in this case supports only the conclusion that the
appellant intended not to kill his son but to further abuse him or that
his intent, if it was to kill the child, was developed in a drunken,
heated, rage while disciplining the child. Neither of those supports a
finding of premeditation or deliberation.

Perhaps because they wish to punish more severely child abusers who kill
their children, other states' legislatures have created laws permitting
them to go beyond second degree murder. For example, Illinois has made
aggravated battery one of the felonies qualifying for "felony murder,"
and a child abuser can be convicted of murder if the child dies as a
result of aggravated battery. **\[ ... \]** California has also adopted
a murder by torture statute making the offense murder in the first
degree without regard to the intent to kill. **\[ ... \]**

All of this goes to show that there remains a difference between first
and second degree murder, not only under our statute, but generally.
Unless our law is changed to permit conviction of first degree murder
for something like child abuse or torture resulting in death, our duty
is to give those accused of first degree murder the benefit of the
requirement that they be shown by substantial evidence to have
premeditated and deliberated the killing, no matter how heinous the
facts may otherwise be. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**The dissenting opinion's conclusion that the appellant
starved Ronnie Jr., must be based solely on the child's underdeveloped
condition which could, presumably, have been caused by any number of
physical malfunctions. There is no evidence the appellant starved the
child. The dissenting opinion says it is for the jury to determine the
degree of murder of which the appellant is guilty. That is true so long
as there is substantial evidence to support the jury's choice. The point
of this opinion is to note that there was no evidence of premeditation
or deliberation which are required elements of the crime of first degree
murder. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Hickman, Justice,

dissenting. Simply put, if a parent deliberately starves and beats a
child to death, he cannot be convicted of the child's murder. In
reaching this decision, the majority **\[ ... \]**substitutes its
judgment for that of the jury. The majority has decided it cannot come
to grips with the question of the battered child who dies as a result of
deliberate, methodical, intentional and severe abuse. A death caused by
such acts is murder by any legal standard, and that fact cannot be
changed---not even by the majority. The degree of murder committed is
for the jury to decide---not us.

**\[ ... \]**

In this case the majority, with clairvoyance, decides that this parent
did not intend to kill his child, but rather to keep him alive for
further abuse. This is not a child neglect case. The state proved
Midgett starved the boy, choked him, and struck him several times in the
stomach and back. The jury could easily conclude that such repeated
treatment was intended to kill the child.

**\[ ... \]**

I cannot fathom how this father could have done what he did; but it is
not my place to sit in judgment of his mental state, nor allow my human
feelings to color my judgment of his accountability to the law. The law
has an objective standard of accountability for all who take human life.
If one does certain acts and the result is murder, one must pay. The
jury found Midgett guilty and, according to the law, there is
substantial evidence to support that verdict. That should end the matter
for us. He is guilty of first degree murder in the eyes of the law. His
moral crime as a father is another matter, and it is not for us to
speculate why he did it.

I would affirm the judgment.

Hays and Glaze, JJ., join in the dissent.

Notes & Questions (Midgett v. State)

 

 

**Notes and Questions**

1\.   *In the Aftermath of the Case*. After *Midgett* was decided, the
Arkansas Attorney General's office drafted a bill with the intention of
"broadening the scope of first degree murder to include cases of child
abuse resulting in death." The Arkansas legislature subsequently passed
the bill with the amendment which states that "\[a\] person commits
murder in the first degree if **...** \[u\]nder circumstances
manifesting cruel and malicious indifference to the value of human life,
he knowingly causes the death of a person fourteen years of age or
younger."[^\[1\]^](#Xc160e5ee64a00ee0b93aed7bc84a44c45eb8a9a)

State v. Forrest

 

Supreme Court of North Carolina

321 N.C. 186

No. 705A86

1987-12-02

**\[ ... \]**

MEYER, Justice.

Defendant was convicted of the first-degree murder of his father, Clyde
Forrest. **\[ ... \]** *T*he case was tried as a noncapital case, and
defendant was sentenced accordingly to life imprisonment. **\[ ... \]**

The facts of this case are essentially uncontested, and the evidence
presented at trial tended to show the following series of events. On 22
December 1985, defendant John Forrest admitted his critically ill
father, Clyde Forrest, Sr., to Moore Memorial Hospital. Defendant's
father, who had previously been hospitalized, was suffering from
numerous serious ailments, including severe heart disease, hypertension,
a thoracic aneurysm, numerous pulmonary emboli, and a peptic ulcer. By
the morning of 23 December 1985, his medical condition was determined to
be unbeatable and terminal. Accordingly, he was classified as "No Code,"
meaning that no extraordinary measures would be used to save his life,
and he was moved to a more comfortable room.

On 24 December 1985, defendant went to the hospital to visit his ailing
father. No other family members were present in his father's room when
he arrived. While one of the nurse's assistants was tending to his
father, defendant told her, "There is no need in doing that. He's
dying." She responded, "Well, I think he's better." The nurse's
assistant noticed that defendant was sniffing as though crying and that
he kept his hand in his pocket during their conversation. She
subsequently went to get the nurse.

When the nurse's assistant returned with the nurse, defendant once again
stated his belief that his father was dying. The nurse tried to comfort
defendant, telling him, "I don't think your father is as sick as you
think he is." Defendant, very upset, responded, "Go to hell. I've been
taking care of him for years. I'll take care of him." Defendant was then
left alone in the room with his father.

Alone at his father's bedside, defendant began to cry and to tell his
father how much he loved him. His father began to cough, emitting a
gurgling and rattling noise. Extremely upset, defendant pulled a small
pistol from his pants pocket, put it to his father's temple, and fired.
He subsequently fired three more times and walked out into the hospital
corridor, dropping the gun to the floor just outside his father's room.

Following the shooting, defendant, who was crying and upset, neither ran
nor threatened anyone. Moreover, he never denied shooting his father and
talked openly with law enforcement officials. Specifically, defendant
made the following oral statements: "You can't do anything to him now.
He's out of his suffering." "I killed my daddy." "He won't have to
suffer anymore." "I know they can burn me for it, but my dad will not
have to suffer anymore." "I know the doctors couldn't do it, but I
could." "I promised my dad I wouldn't let him suffer."

**\[ ... \]** Though defendant's father had been near death as a result
of his medical condition, the exact cause of the deceased's death was
determined to be the four point-blank bullet wounds to his head.
Defendant's pistol was a single-action .22-calibre five-shot revolver.
The weapon, which had to be cocked each time it was fired, contained
four empty shells and one live round.

At the close of the evidence, defendant's case was submitted to the jury
for one of four possible verdicts: first-degree murder, second-degree
murder, voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty. After a lengthy
deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder.
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In his second assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial
court committed reversible error in denying his motion for directed
verdict as to the first-degree murder charge. Specifically, defendant
argues that the trial court's submission of the first-degree murder
charge was improper because there was insufficient evidence of
premeditation and deliberation presented at trial. We do not agree**\[
... \]**.

We recently addressed this very issue in the case of *State v. Jackson,*
317 N.C. 1, 343 S.E. 2d 814 (1986). Our analysis of the relevant law in
that case is instructive in the case at bar:

> Before the issue of a defendant's guilt may be submitted to the jury,
> the trial court must be satisfied that substantial evidence has been
> introduced tending to prove each essential element of the offense
> charged**\[ ... \]**.
>
> First-degree murder is the intentional and unlawful killing of a human
> being with malice and with premeditation and deliberation. **\[ ...
> \]**
>
> Premeditation and deliberation relate to mental processes and
> ordinarily are not readily susceptible to proof by direct evidence.
> Instead, they usually must be proved by circumstantial evidence. **\[
> ... \]** Among other circumstances to be considered in determining
> whether a killing was with premeditation and deliberation are: (1)
> want of provocation on the part of the deceased; (2) the conduct and
> statements of the defendant before and after the killing; (3) threats
> and declarations of the defendant before and during the course of the
> occurrence giving rise to the death of the deceased; (4) ill-will or
> previous difficulty between the parties; (5) the dealing of lethal
> blows after the deceased has been felled and rendered helpless; and
> (6) evidence that the killing was done in a brutal manner. **\[ ...
> \]**We have also held that the nature and number of the victim's
> wounds is a circumstance from which premeditation and deliberation can
> be inferred. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

As in *Jackson,* we hold in the present case that there was substantial
evidence that the killing was premeditated and deliberate **\[ ... \]**.
Here, many of the circumstances that we have held to establish a factual
basis for a finding of premeditation and deliberation are present. It is
clear, for example, that the seriously ill deceased did nothing to
provoke defendant's action. Moreover, the deceased was lying helpless in
a hospital bed when defendant shot him four separate times. In addition,
defendant's revolver was a five-shot single-action gun which had to be
cocked each time before it could be fired. Interestingly, although
defendant testified that he always carried the gun in his job as a truck
driver, he was not working on the day in question but carried the gun to
the hospital nonetheless.

Most persuasive of all on the issue of premeditation and deliberation,
however, are defendant's own statements following the incident. Among
other things, defendant stated that he had thought about putting his
father out of his misery because he knew he was suffering. He stated
further that he had promised his father that he would not let him suffer
and that, though he did not think he could do it, he just could not
stand to see his father suffer any more. These statements, together with
the other circumstances mentioned above, make it clear that the trial
court did not err in submitting to the jury the issue of first-degree
murder based upon premeditation and deliberation. **\[ ... \]**

No error.

Chief Justice Exum

dissenting.

Almost all would agree that someone who kills because of a desire to end
a loved one's physical suffering caused by an illness which is both
terminal and incurable should not be deemed in law as culpable and
deserving of the same punishment as one who kills because of unmitigated
spite, hatred or ill will. **\[ ... \]**

The difference, legally, between the two kinds of killings hinges on the
element of malice, the former being without, and the latter with,
malice. The absence of malice, however, does not mean the killing is
justified or excused so as not to be unlawful; it means simply that the
killing is mitigated so as not to be murder but manslaughter. **\[ ...
\]**

**\[ ... \]**The trial court instructed that malice was "that condition
of mind that prompts a person to take the life of another intentionally
.. . without just cause, excuse or justification." **\[ ... \]**The
trial court should have added "and without mitigation."

**\[ ... \]**

For this error in the trial court's instructions, I vote to give
defendant a new trial.

Notes & Questions (State v. Forrest)

 

 

**Notes and Questions**

1\.   *Forrest and its aftermath. State v. Forrest* is the first case in
which the North Carolina Supreme Court addressed the issue of "mercy
killing." Defendants in mercy killing cases are rarely convicted of
murder because their stories are often sympathetic to
juries.[^\[1\]^](#Xa9e67040b1c70d97d822bda72c712d1fc3401dd) Do you think
the right judgement was reached in *Forrest*?

2\.    *The Homicide Trio. Forrest*, *Guthrie*, and *Midgett* are three
cases designed to work together to achieve the particular ends of
showing that moral culpability or blameworthiness unfortunately does not
always map onto legal culpability and punishment. *Guthrie* provides the
groundwork of premeditation, and an example of a case where the
defendant's action probably didn't deserve a first-degree conviction,
and the court came to the "right" determination by ordering a new trial.
What about *Forrest* and *Midgett*?

             Do you agree that *Forrest* shows a "wrong" result, where a
killing done for sympathetic reasons by someone who shows no malice (in
the colloquial, not legal, sense of the word) is nonetheless considered
first-degree due to the clear element of premeditation? Do you agree
that *Midgett* showcases a "wrong" result in the opposite direction \--
a heinous killing that deserved a first-degree conviction, is
nonetheless deemed only second-degree due to (what the Court deems) a
lack of premeditation?

              All of this goes to show that satisfaction of the elements
of the statutes matters more in regard to how punishment is meted out
than
blameworthiness.[^\[2\]^](#Xcd8880f848e32d750f020260a0d188fab6924db)

3.      *Benevolent Murder.* The aphorism "the road to hell is paved
with good intentions" is particularly relevant to this case because
while Forrest intended to put his father out of his misery, he still
committed murder. Because intent is such a large part of securing a
conviction in criminal law, consider how a lack of access to legal
knowledge can lead some individuals to believe that an illegal action
with good intentions should lead to a lessened sentence, when that is
very much not the case.

                 Should benevolent intent be a factor when considering
how to charge the perpetrator of a crime?

Forrest received a first-degree murder conviction for a crime
significantly less heinous than Midgett who received a second-degree
murder conviction.

Heat of Passion/ Manslaughter

 

Distinctions within the group of crimes known as "homicide" depend on
more than the different mens rea levels associated with a killing.
Knowing that a person killed someone (act) with purpose or knowledge
(mens rea) does not necessarily mean that the person committed "murder."
Criminal law sometimes takes additional circumstances into account when
assigning blame. In the case of knowingly or purposefully killing
someone, provocation or extreme emotional disturbance might mitigate the
crime of murder down to voluntary manslaughter. As the cases below
demonstrate, different courts have taken different approaches in
defining whether and what circumstances might lessen the seriousness of
an intentional killing. As you read these cases, consider the challenges
that courts face when they downgrade a crime committed with the same
basic act, result, and mens rea. Where and how do courts draw lines
between which circumstances mitigate murder, and which circumstances
don't? In determining the effect of provocation or emotional distress,
should courts look at a criminal's individual nature, or hold him/her to
an objective standard?

Teaching Memo on Heat of Passion/Manslaughter

 

**By Christina Iriart, Nathaniel Perez, Phillip Yin**

**Chapter 7: Manslaughter -- "Heat of Passion" Killings**

Chapter 7 of the Dressler and Garvey casebook introduces students to the
concept of mitigation of murder to manslaughter via the provocation
doctrine. Though discussing the crimes of murder and manslaughter
require talking about an intentional homicide, the selected cases
contain unnecessarily graphic depictions of violence and are detailed in
a problematic manner. Furthermore, the notes and questions following the
cases are troubling and at times perpetuate stereotypes regarding race,
gender and crime.

 

**Case #1: *Girouard v. State*, 321 Md. 532 (1991)**

This case involves the difficult subject of intimate partner violence
and describes a bloody, intentional second degree murder. The goal of
the case is to show that words alone are not adequate provocation to
mitigate murder to manslaughter. It is difficult to accomplish this goal
without describing a murder/manslaughter scenario and corresponding
inflammatory words. Given this limitation, the case ultimately succeeds
in its educational mission. Nevertheless, the case depiction need not
linger in graphic details that may trigger potentially traumatic
memories in the reader. Particularly egregious is footnote 1 on page
283, which denotes Joyce Girouard's strained relationship with her
father due to him impregnating her at fourteen, resulting in an
abortion. This detail is irrelevant to the lesson of the case and risks
resurfacing painful memories of a reader with similar experiences for no
educational purpose. The costs of including this footnote vastly
outweigh any perceived benefit. Furthermore, the way the case is
presented reads like an unnecessary dramatization of the facts,
illustrated by the following excerpt from the text:

After pausing for a moment, Joyce asked what Steven was going to do.
What he did was lunge at her with the kitchen knife he had hidden behind
the pillow and stab her 19 times. Realizing what he had done, he dropped
the knife and went to the bathroom to shower off Joyce's blood. Feeling
like he wanted to die, Steven went back to the kitchen and found two
steak knives with which he slit his own wrists. Dressler at 284.

 

The notes following *Girouard* are largely unproblematic, save for note
5. The notes contain useful discussions about the function of the judge
and jury and the shifting legal landscape of what constitutes adequate
provocation. Note 4 is important because it highlights that the act of
finding a spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another is no
longer a legally sufficient basis for mitigating murder to manslaughter
in Maryland. Note 5, however, contains an unnecessary reference to
forcible sodomy. The rule statement can easily be kept without reference
to the activating material.

 

**Our Recommendations and Supplemental Materials**

To the extent possible, we propose the use of a version of the case
edited to exclude the graphic detailing of potentially triggering
subject-matter. 

 

We also recommend supplementing *Girouard* with a hypothetical so that
students may test their understanding of adequate provocation and how
its application may vary throughout
jurisdictions.[^\[1\]^](#Xec0f261a9fd0b6eef8f88f0252476e3a75382cf)

 

**Case #2:** ***People v. Cassassa*, 49 N.Y.2d 668, 404 N.E.2d 1310
(1980)**

This case is troubling because it centers around stalking and a
gratuitously violent fact pattern. *Cassassa* is used to portray the
mitigation from murder to manslaughter by the defendant pleading extreme
emotional disturbance. It shows how extreme emotional disturbance, per
the Model Penal Code, has both a subjective and objective element and
how this differs from the common law "heat of passion" defense. However,
the fact pattern regarding stalking can be extremely triggering to many
people. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence
(NCADV), 1 in 7 women and 1 in 18 men have been "stalked by an intimate
partner during their lifetime to the point in which they felt very
fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed
or killed."[^\[2\]^](#X64bf8f3f3c0cd7f9179f95c6d2492dcd1f95a99) ^ ^Based
on this statistic, it is likely that this particular case may cause
anxiety in those that have experienced stalking, and it may not be
conducive to learning about extreme emotional disturbance through the
lens of such a triggering and explicitly violent fact pattern. It should
be removed and supplanted with another case.

** **

**N1**: This note was redundant in light of *Cassassa*. While it may be
a good substitute case for teaching how extreme emotional disturbance is
used, it is not necessary to keep in light of another case.  *See
footnote 3*.

** **

**N2**: This note is trying to further explain the subjective aspect of
extreme emotional disturbance by showing an example of "reasonableness
of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of
a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes
them to be." pg 305-06. This might be activating because it talks about
a man believing someone to be a rapist, so while it talks about an
important aspect of EED, it can be presented in a different way. It may
be beneficial to use a different in-class hypothetical. *See footnote
3.*

** **

**N3:** The intent of the note may be to highlight the irrationality of
a racist belief, but the hypothetical is presented in such an
insensitive manner that it appears racist in its own right. This note
can be removed and substituted by a different hypothetical. *See
footnote 5.*

** **

**N4**: This note talks about sexual assault. It tries to teach how to
understand how different statutes create different outcomes in the same
situation, but a different hypothetical can provide the same pedagogical
purpose without talking about sexual violence. *See footnote 4.*

** **

**N5:** This note is not problematic, but it might be unnecessary here
because it talks about the diminished capacity and insanity defenses. It
can be used in a later chapter regarding the difference between
diminished capacity and insanity versus extreme emotional disturbance.

**N6-8**: These notes are okay, they note the different results between
men and women when they seek mitigation through extreme emotional
disturbance. It would provide a good foundation and segue into an
in-class discussion on the gendered results of pleading EED.

 

**Our Recommendations and Supplemental Materials**

We recommend exchanging *Casassa* for *State v. Ott*, which also
explains extreme emotional disturbance and both the subjective and
objective elements regarding the Model Penal Code, and how this differs
from the common law "heat of passion" defense. 

 

We suggest using rule statements from *State v. Elliot *in replacement
of Notes 1 and
2.[^\[3\]^](#X89bee75b63d2951c825950f8b0c3817ffd91162) This case
discusses that raising EED does not negate intent, but serves to
mitigate culpability. It also distinguishes between the subjective and
objective elements of extreme emotional distress.

 

Additionally, we suggest using *Johnson v. State *as a different
hypothetical in replacement of Note
4.[^\[4\]^](#X4d9ff873a8eae66df0f2204206c681dd74ccc7b) The case offers
instructions on extreme emotional distress regarding the Model Penal
Code. In contrast to the current note, it is unproblematic and it also
exemplifies extreme emotional distress outside of the context of
interrelationship/domestic violence.

Finally, in order to show the subjective element of EED, we suggest a
hypothetical to replace Note
3.[^\[5\]^](#X13898dc889e47f02df046a67e957bf91ae24905) It simply
replaces the racial aspect in favor of a differentiating factor that is
not as insensitive.

Girouard v. State

 

321 Md. 532 (1991)

583 A.2d 718

STEVEN SAUNDERS GIROUARD\
v.\
STATE OF MARYLAND.

No. 65, September Term, 1989.

Court of Appeals of Maryland.

January 8, 1991.

COLE, Judge.

In this case we are asked to reconsider whether the types of provocation
sufficient to mitigate the crime of murder to manslaughter should be
limited to the categories we have heretofore recognized, or whether the
sufficiency of the provocation should be decided by the factfinder on a
case-by-case basis. Specifically, we must determine whether words alone
are provocation adequate to justify a conviction of manslaughter rather
than one of second degree murder.

The Petitioner, Steven S. Girouard, and the deceased, Joyce M. Girouard,
had been married for about two months on October 28, 1987, the night of
Joyce\'s death. Both parties, who met while working in the same
building, were in the army. They married after having known each other
for approximately three months. The evidence at trial indicated that the
marriage was often tense and strained, and there was some evidence that
after marrying Steven, Joyce had resumed a relationship with her old
boyfriend, Wayne.

On the night of Joyce\'s death, Steven overheard her talking on the
telephone to her friend, whereupon she told the friend that she had
asked her first sergeant for a hardship discharge because her husband
did not love her anymore. Steven went into the living room where Joyce
was on the phone and asked her what she meant by her comments; she
responded, \"nothing.\" Angered by her lack of response, Steven kicked
away the plate of food Joyce had in front of her. He then went to lie
down in the bedroom....

\[Steven testified that Joyce followed him into the bedroom, and their
fight escalated. Joyce repeatedly insulted him and told him that "the
marriage had been a mistake."\] 

\[Steven\] left the bedroom with his pillow in his arms and proceeded to
the kitchen where he procured a long handled kitchen knife. He returned
to Joyce in the bedroom with the knife behind the pillow. He testified
that he was enraged and that he kept waiting for Joyce to say she was
kidding, but Joyce continued talking.... Joyce reiterated that the
marriage was a big mistake, that she did not love him and that the
divorce would be better for her....

\[Steven then\] lunged at her with the kitchen knife he had hidden
behind the pillow and stab her 19 times. Realizing what he had done, he
dropped the knife and went to the bathroom to shower off Joyce\'s blood.
Feeling like he wanted to die, Steven went back to the kitchen and found
two steak knives with which he slit his own wrists. He lay down on the
bed waiting to die, but when he realized that he would not die from his
self-inflicted wounds, he got up and called the police, telling the
dispatcher that he had just murdered his wife.

When the police arrived they found Steven wandering around outside his
apartment building. Steven was despondent and tearful and seemed
detached, according to police officers who had been at the scene. He was
unconcerned about his own wounds, talking only about how much he loved
his wife and how he could not believe what he had done. Joyce Girouard
was pronounced dead at the scene....

Steven Girouard was convicted, at a court trial in the Circuit Court for
Montgomery County, of second degree murder and was sentenced to 22 years
incarceration, 10 of which were suspended.... We granted certiorari to
determine whether the circumstances of the case presented provocation
adequate to mitigate the second degree murder charge to manslaughter.

Petitioner relies primarily on out of state cases to provide support for
his argument that the provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter
should not be limited only to the traditional circumstances of: extreme
assault or battery upon the defendant; mutual combat; defendant\'s
illegal arrest; injury or serious abuse of a close relative of the
defendant\'s; or the sudden discovery of a spouse\'s adultery.
Petitioner argues that manslaughter is a catchall for homicides which
are criminal but that lack the malice essential for a conviction of
murder. Steven argues that the trial judge did find provocation
(although he held it inadequate to mitigate murder) and that the
categories of provocation adequate to mitigate should be broadened to
include factual situations such as this one.

The State counters by stating that although there is no finite list of
legally adequate provocations, the common law has developed to a point
at which it may be said there are some concededly provocative acts that
society is not prepared to recognize as reasonable. Words spoken by the
victim, no matter how abusive or taunting, fall into a category society
should not accept as adequate provocation. According to the State, if
abusive words alone could mitigate murder to manslaughter, nearly every
domestic argument ending in the death of one party could be mitigated to
manslaughter. This, the State avers, is not an acceptable outcome. Thus,
the State argues that the courts below were correct in holding that the
taunting words by Joyce Girouard were not provocation adequate to reduce
Steven\'s second degree murder charge to voluntary manslaughter.

Initially, we note that the difference between murder and manslaughter
is the presence or absence of malice. Voluntary manslaughter has been
defined as \"an intentional homicide, done in a sudden heat of passion,
caused by adequate provocation, before there has been a reasonable
opportunity for the passion to cool.\" 

There are certain facts that may mitigate what would normally be murder
to manslaughter. For example, we have recognized as falling into that
group: (1) discovering one\'s spouse in the act of sexual intercourse
with another; (2) mutual combat; (3) assault and battery. There is also
authority recognizing injury to one of the defendant\'s relatives or to
a third party, and death resulting from resistance of an illegal arrest
as adequate provocation for mitigation to manslaughter. Those acts
mitigate homicide to manslaughter because they create passion in the
defendant and are not considered the product of free will. 

In order to determine whether murder should be mitigated to manslaughter
we look to the circumstances surrounding the homicide and try to
discover if it was provoked by the victim. Over the facts of the case we
lay the template of the so-called \"Rule of Provocation.\" The courts of
this State have repeatedly set forth the requirements of the Rule of
Provocation:

1\. There must have been adequate provocation;

2\. The killing must have been in the heat of passion;

3\. It must have been a sudden heat of passion --- that is, the killing
must have followed the provocation before there had been a reasonable
opportunity for the passion to cool;

4\. There must have been a causal connection between the provocation,
the passion, and the fatal act.

We shall assume without deciding that the second, third, and fourth of
the criteria listed above were met in this case. We focus our attention
on an examination of the ultimate issue in this case, that is, whether
the provocation of Steven by Joyce was enough in the eyes of the law so
that the murder charge against Steven should have been mitigated to
voluntary manslaughter. For provocation to be \"adequate,\" it must be
\"\`calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to
cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason.\'\" The
issue we must resolve, then, is whether the taunting words uttered by
Joyce were enough to inflame the passion of a reasonable man so that
that man would be sufficiently infuriated so as to strike out in
hot-blooded blind passion to kill her. Although we agree with the trial
judge that there was needless provocation by Joyce, we also agree with
him that the provocation was not adequate to mitigate second degree
murder to voluntary manslaughter.

Although there are few Maryland cases discussing the issue at bar, those
that do hold that words alone are not adequate provocation.
....\[W\]ords can constitute adequate provocation if they are
accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to
cause the defendant bodily harm. ...

Other jurisdictions overwhelmingly agree with our cases and hold that
words alone are not adequate provocation. ...

Thus, with no reservation, we hold that the provocation in this case was
not enough to cause a reasonable man to stab his provoker 19 times. ...
The standard is one of reasonableness; it does not and should not focus
on the peculiar frailties of mind of the Petitioner. That standard of
reasonableness has not been met here. We cannot in good conscience
countenance holding that a verbal domestic argument ending in the death
of one spouse can result in a conviction of manslaughter. We agree with
the trial judge that social necessity dictates our holding. Domestic
arguments easily escalate into furious fights. We perceive no reason for
a holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a domestic
dispute is by killing the offending spouse.

We will leave to another day the possibility of expansion of the
categories of adequate provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter.
The facts of this case do not warrant the broadening of the categories
recognized thus far.

JUDGMENT AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.

Notes and Questions for Girouard v. State

 

1.     In California, the standard for adequate provocation \"is whether
or not the defendant\'s reason was, at the time of his act, so disturbed
or obscured by some passion \[...\] to such an extent as would render
ordinary men of average disposition liable to act rashly or without due
deliberation and reflection, and from this passion rather than from
judgment." People v. Beltran, 56 Cal. 4th 935, 948 (2013), (citing
People v. Logan*,*  175 Cal. 45, 49 (1917)). Do you see any inherent
bias in the way such a standard is worded? Would an \"ordinary man\"
react differently in a provocative situation, than say an \"ordinary
woman\"? At common law, witnessing one\'s spouse in the act of adultery
was grounds to mitigate murder to manslaughter. Consider that adultery
was once viewed as the "\'highest invasion of \[a husband's\] property,"
and that  "a 'reasonable man' might be provoked to kill his adulterous
wife, but not his adulterous fiancée or common-law wife" Brief for San
Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting
the People of the State of California, People v. Beltran, 56 Cal. 4th
935 (2013) (No. S192644.), 2012 WL 1859371 at 7-8. What justification do
you see courts applying the common law used to defend a husband's
killing of his adulterous wife? Could the same justification be used to
defend a wife who killed her adulterous husband?

 

 

2.     Do you believe that there is ever a circumstance in which words
could constitute adequate provocation? Suppose that *P* is a person of
color who heard a rumor that X, Y and Z had murdered somebody in a hate
crime. He is walking home alone when all of a sudden, he is surrounded
by several people wearing Swastikas and recognizes X, Y and Z in the
group. They yell racial slurs at him and promise to hurt him and his
family. If *P* kills one of them and asserts a provocation defense, will
he succeed under Girouard*?* Would it make a difference if he had
personally witnessed the prior hate-crime murder? In Girouard*,* the
court ruled that "words alone are not adequate provocation," reasoning
that Joyce's words were not "accompanied by conduct indicating a present
intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm." But what if
the words constitute real threats? Is there a substantive difference
between the weight of the words used by X, Y and Z (racial slurs and
threats) and words agreeing to commit a criminal conspiracy?

 

 

3.     Under the common law, the doctrine of provocation developed along
the lines of fixed categories of conduct by the victim, paradigms of
misbehavior, which the law recognized as sufficiently provocative to
mitigate what would otherwise be malicious conduct by the defendant.\"
Brown v. United States, 584 A.2d 537 (D.C. App. 1990). As cited in
Girouard, examples of these categorical acts that constitute adequate
provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter include \"discovering
one's spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another; mutual
combat; assault and battery \[...\] injury to one of the defendant's
relatives or to a third party, and death resulting from resistance of an
illegal arrest.\"  

However, the modern trend in many states, including California, \"tracks
\[a\] move away from specified categories of provocation to a more
generalized standard based on the concept of an ordinary person of
average disposition, leaving for the jury whether the given facts show
adequate provocation.\" People v. Beltran, 56 Cal. 4th 935, 947 (2013).

 

What problems do you see with the common law provocation doctrine,
limiting provocation to explicitly stated behaviors? What does the
common law assume about an objective, "reasonable man"? What problems
might arise leaving the issue to be decided by the jury?

 

4.     What constitutes a \"reasonable opportunity for the passion to
cool\" is usually left up to the jury to decide. How should we determine
what is a \"reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool?\" Should
this bar evidence of provocative conduct that occurred long before the
killing?

 

Imagine that a student, A, is deathly allergic to peanuts. Even their
scent causes A to suffer anaphylaxis which induces great fear in A. B
purposefully brings a bag of peanuts to class and opens them next to A.
A goes into anaphylactic shock and is hospitalized overnight. The next
day, A returns to class and kills B. What result under Girouard? What
result under Maher v. People, 10 Mich. 212 (1862) (stating "the
principle involved in the question \[of what constitutes adequate
provocation\] would seem to suggest as the true general rule, that
reason should, at the time of the act, be disturbed or obscured by
passion to an extent which *might* render ordinary men, of fair average
disposition, *liable* to act rashly or without due deliberation or
reflection, and from passion, rather than judgment" (emphasis added) ?
What result under the common law provocation rule's objective examples? 

Now imagine that for years, *M* has been bullied by *T*. One day, *M*
finally snaps in direct response to one of *T\'*s abusive episodes and
kills *T.* Should evidence illustrating *M* and *T\'*s earlier
interactions be taken into consideration when deciding whether *M* has a
provocation defense or should the jury only consider the event
immediately preceding *M*\'s killing of *T*? What result under Girouard?
What result under Maher? What result under the common law provocation
rule's objective examples?

 

5.     Suppose a woman, *D,* hears that her son has been hit by a blue
SUV and is severely injured. A witness with faulty memory recites the
license plate. After several hours, she identifies what she believes is
the car involved in the accident and confronts the driver of the car,
*V*. In reality, *V* had nothing to do with the accident. However,
blinded by her rage, *D* ends up killing *V.* What result under
Girouard*?* Under the MPC? What if *V* had said, \"I\'m going to run you
over if you don\'t move\" while lurching the car forward at her \-- what
result under Girouard*?* Under the MPC?

 

6.     Suppose a fight between strangers at a bar ensues. One patron
begins taunting another and yells, "if you have a pistol, take it out
and use it!" The other patron walks outside of the bar to his car,
retrieves his gun, and returns to the bar. He shoots the victim several
times, killing him. Arguing as the prosecution and then as the defense,
does this taunting constitute adequate provocation in a *Girouard*
jurisdiction? What about under California law? See [People v.
Manriquez]{.underline}, 37 Cal. 4th 547, 584, 123 P.3d 614 (2005).

 

7.  *   Traditional common law approach.* Common law held that a
"reasonable man" must be judged by a wholly objective test, completely
eliminating a defendant\'s physical condition and characteristics. Now,
if the words-alone rule was abandoned, would you change the common law's
view on a "reasonable man"? What if the defendant was only 4 feet 5
inches tall, and the victim 6 feet; should the court then consider the
defendant's physical stature in deciding whether there was adequate
provocation?

 

8.  *   Gender and the reasonable man*. Consider the common law's
"reasonable man" standard as you read through these statistics.

 

-   "Of the \[homicide\] offenders for whom gender was known, 90.3
    percent were males." [U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of
    Investiagtion, Uniform Crime Report: Crime in the United States
    (2010)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expandhomicidemain)

-   "Females are generally murdered by people they know. In 64% of
    female homicide cases in 2007, females were killed by a family
    member or intimate partner." [Bureau of Justice Statistics, Victims
    of Violence (2009)](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvv.pdf)

-   Over half of female homicides are products of intimate partner
    violence. [Center of Disease
    Control](http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6628a1). Petrosky E., et
    al. Racial and Ethnic Differences in Homicides of Adult Women and
    the Role of Intimate Partner Violence, MMWR Morb mortal Wkly Rep
    2017; 66: 741-746 (2003-2014)

 

Often, adequate provocation reflects a traditional male view of self
control, mostly because homicide statistics are largely male dominated.
Should jurors consider gender when deciding whether the accused falls
under a "reasonable man" standard? How should jurors judge the accused
if she identifies as a woman and claims she was adequately provoked - by
the reasonable man standard, or something else? 

Additionally, if men are statistically more likely to be violent, does
that mean unusually violent women should be *denied* the provocation
defense? Does the provocation defense reflect fairness, blameworthiness,
or representativeness? If the defense is grounded in fairness, should an
unusually violent woman be denied the provocation defense? What about if
it is grounded in blameworthiness or representativeness?

 

9.     See [Commonwealth v. Carr]{.underline}, 398 Pa. Super. 306, 580
A.2d 1362 (1990). Sarah was on a hike when she stopped to have a snack.
She pulled out a sandwich and sat on a nearby rock. When she put her
backpack down, a knife fell out of a pocket and next to her foot. John,
a man who grew up afraid of knives, spotted Sarah. He saw the knife and
became enraged. John pulled out his gun, shooting Sarah five times and
killing her. John defended himself stating that he shot Sarah in the
heat of passion, caused by serious provocation of seeing the knife,
which reminded him of an abusive childhood. He presented evidence that
his step-father used to threaten John with knives.

 

The court concluded that evidence of John's fears was inadmissible: "It
is not adequate provocation to reduce an unlawful killing from murder to
voluntary manslaughter. It is not an event which is sufficient to cause
a reasonable person to become so impassioned as to be incapable of cool
reflection." [Commonwealth v. Carr]{.underline}, 398 Pa. Super. 306
(1990). The court continued, arguing that John's past does not establish
adequate provocation.

 

Do you agree? Should John's childhood background be considered?

 

Would your analysis of adequate provocation change if Sarah
hypothetically yelled, "Stop staring at me, freak!", and why? What part
of the provocation doctrine would that fall under?

STATE of Oregon, Respondent On Review,\

Calvin Roy OTT, Petitioner On Review.

No. TC 80-522-C, CA A23254, SC 29428.

Supreme Court of Oregon, In Banc.\[\*\]

Argued and Submitted August 2, 1983.

Decided July 10, 1984.

 

LENT, Justice.

The primary issue is how a jury is to be instructed on \"extreme
emotional disturbance\" for the purpose of determining whether a
criminal homicide is murder or manslaughter. The defendant was charged
with murder for killing his wife in April, 1980. It is undisputed that
the defendant killed her intentionally; the dispute is whether he was
under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. If he was, he
would be guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.

At that time ORS 163.115 provided:

\"(1) \* \* \* \[C\]riminal homicide constitutes murder when:

\"(a) It is committed intentionally by a person who is not under the
influence of an extreme emotional disturbance.

\"\* \* \*

\"(2) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this
section, a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under
the influence of extreme emotional disturbance when such disturbance is
not the result of the person\'s own intentional, knowing, reckless or
criminally negligent act, and for which disturbance there is a
reasonable explanation. The reasonableness of the explanation for the
disturbance shall be determined from the standpoint of an ordinary
person in the actor\'s situation under the circumstances as the actor
reasonably believes them to be.\"

...

The defendant was convicted of murdering his wife. At trial he did not
contest the accusation that he killed her intentionally. Instead, he
adduced evidence to mitigate the charge of murder to that of
manslaughter by showing that he was under the influence of an extreme
emotional disturbance during the killing.

The Evidence

A description of the evidence and the facts which could be found
therefrom as perceived by the defendant is relevant to the question of
whether he could have been found by the jury to be under the influence
of extreme emotional disturbance when he committed the criminal
homicide, thereby necessitating an instruction on extreme emotional
disturbance. There was evidence of the following:

The defendant exhibited instability after his discharge from the Air
Force in 1972. He \"drifted in various parts of the United States\" and
put \"very little order to his life.\" In 1975 he returned to his
mother\'s home in Grants Pass and stayed there intermittently.

At some point after his return to Grants Pass, he began to cohabit with
a woman who had three children. This lasted for a little over a year.
The woman then asked the defendant to move out because of his drinking
and unannounced disappearances. She was three months\' pregnant by him
at the time.

The defendant then enrolled at Rogue Community College at Grants Pass.
There he met the now deceased Stephanie Elaine Brinkley, whom he married
three weeks after their initial meeting. Some months after their
marriage, they had a fight over \"money matters\" and separated. \...

Defendant attempted to return to his wife; however, she had begun seeing
someone else. Defendant attempted to fight Stephanie\'s new lover.
Stephanie intervened, sent her new lover away and promised that her
conduct would not be repeated.

There were other separations, and the defendant, upon his return from
each separation and his learning of more infidelities, became
progressively more upset. This was especially so after the birth of
their first child....

He had been warned by the \"authorities\" to stay away from Stephanie.
She apparently caused him to be placed under a judicial restraining
order; however, despite her obtaining the order, Stephanie telephoned
him regarding their divorce. They engaged in an apparently protracted
series of arguments on the telephone over child custody, which
eventuated in the defendant\'s arrest and jailing for harassment. Even
though they engaged in arguments and fights, they continued to
associate. Defendant could not stay away from Stephanie and Stephanie
did not always discourage his attentions.

In 1980 Stephanie began to live with another man. This conduct affected
the defendant, as before, with tension and \"stress.\" The defendant\'s
reaction was even more intense than before, and he threatened to kill
Stephanie on several occasions.

In early April, 1980, Stephanie\'s son, Jonathan (defendant\'s stepson),
broke his arm and was in the hospital. The defendant and Stephanie met
each other at the hospital in order to visit with the child on three
occasions. It was arranged that on the third occasion the defendant was
to drive Stephanie home after hospital visiting hours were over.
Defendant had the impression from their first two meetings at the
hospital that the relationship was improving. He was thus angered and
disappointed when his wife\'s new lover appeared at the hospital on
their third meeting to take her home. Defendant left the hospital in a
state of agitation. He retrieved a .22 rifle that he had stored at the
home of a friend, caught up with his wife and her lover, ran their truck
off the road and shot his wife three times....

History of Mitigating Factor

Before addressing how a jury should be charged in a case where the
influence of extreme emotional disturbance may reduce an intentional
criminal homicide from murder to manslaughter, we pause to examine the
history of the mitigating factor.

The defense of extreme emotional disturbance is a modification of the
defense of provocation or heat of passion. The provocation defense is
very old. The distinction between a slaying in cold blood and one in the
heat of passion existed in Anglo-Saxon criminal law and survived the
Norman conquest of 1066. The \"Doctrine of Provocation\" became firmly
established in the law in 1628 when Coke adopted the distinction between
homicide committed after deliberation and homicide committed in the
course of a sudden quarrel... Then, as now, manslaughter ... depended on
the presence of heat of passion caused by adequate provocation....

In the mid-nineteenth century, the judgment as to whether a provocation
was adequate for the heat of passion defense was made by the judge as a
determination of law; however, judges gradually began to leave
borderline cases to the jury. The reasonable man standard of review for
provocation was devised as a manner of instructing the jury on marginal
cases. It was also a device for enabling the jury to serve as community
conscience or standard of measure for reasonable behavior....

This has been said to be an objective test, meaning that neither the
mental nor physical peculiarities of the accused are evaluated in
determining whether his loss of self-control was reasonable.... 

The common law heat of passion or provocation defense placed the jury in
the conceptually awkward (to put it kindly) position of having to
determine when it is reasonable for a reasonable man to act
unreasonably.  (Granville Williams, Provocation and the Reasonable
Man, 1954 Crim.L.Rev. 740, 742).

Another writer comments that: \"Abandonment of the reasonable man
standard would simplify the jury\'s task because the inquiry into the
accused\'s own mental state is more concretely grounded in reality than
are conjectures about a mythical reasonable man.\"

The Model Penal Code \[adopted by Oregon in 1970\]

The drafters of the Model Penal Code were aware of the anomaly and
pointed out that harsh and unjust results were obtained from applying
the objective test for provocation. They cited State v.
Gounagias, 88 Wash. 304, 153 P. 9 (1915), as a model of an unjust result
achieved through application of the objective test for provocation....

\[That case involved a defendant who, humiliated after being raped by a
man in his community, asked him not to tell others about the incident.
The assailant persisted in spreading the story, which resulted in
defendant's being shamed and isolated from his community. After an angry
confrontation with the assailant, defendant went home, got a gun and
returned to kill the assailant. The court denied defendant's request for
mitigation from murder to manslaughter, finding Gounagias has waited too
long after the original incident for provocation to be invoked.\]

The drafters of the Model Penal Code found it \"shocking\" to disregard
that the passage of time served only to increase rather than diminish
Gounagias\' outrage as the story became known. Model Penal Code
Tentative draft No. 9 § 201.3 at 48. They said:

\"...in such a situation as Gounagias, where lapse of time increased
rather than diminished the extent of the outrage perpetrated on the
actor, as he became aware that his disgrace was known, it was shocking
in our view to hold this vital fact to be irrelevant....\"

 

 \[in 1971, Oregon revised its homicide law along the lines of the Model
Penal Code, to provide: \"a homicide which would otherwise be murder is
committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance when such
disturbance is not the result of the person\'s own intentional, knowing,
reckless or criminally negligent act, and for which disturbance there is
a reasonable explanation. The reasonableness of the explanation for the
disturbance shall be determined from the standpoint of an ordinary
person in the actor\'s situation under the circumstances as the actor
reasonably believes them to be.\" (italics added)\]

 

The Trial Court\'s Instruction

\[At the close of the trial, the court instructed the jury using the
above statutory language. As is common practice, it provided additional
instructions, which included the following\]:

\"I instruct you that the concept of extreme emotional disturbance
involves several issues, all of which must be considered by you. One,
the homicidal act must have been committed under the influence of an
extreme emotional disturbance, and two, the extreme emotional
disturbance must not be the result of the Defendant\'s own intentional,
knowing, reckless or criminally negligent act. Thus, a person may not
form an intent to commit murder and later because of that intent become
extremely emotionally disturbed, and three, the extreme disturbance must
be an extreme emotional disturbance. You are instructed that there are
varying degrees of emotional disturbance. Not every disturbance is an
extreme emotional disturbance in the law. In determining what the term
extreme means with reference to extreme emotional disturbance I instruct
you that the term means the outermost or furtherest, most remote in any
direction, final or last, and four, there must be a reasonable
explanation to the extreme emotional disturbance and its resulting
homicidal act." \[italics added\]

 

Both in the trial court and on appeal the defendant has argued that the
term \"extreme emotional disturbance\" is made up of words of ordinary
meaning, not given any special definition by the legislature and,
therefore, there is no reason or need for a trial court to enlarge upon
them for the benefit of the jury. ...

We agree with the defendant that the jury should be instructed on the
meaning of the whole term rather than singling out the word \"extreme\"
for amplification. The point of the extreme emotional disturbance
defense is to provide a basis for mitigation that differs from a finding
of mental defect or disease to such an extent as altogether to preclude
criminal responsibility.

... The notion of \"extreme\" provided for the jury ... is consonant
with an understanding of emotional disturbance that might preclude
criminal responsibility. The words \"outermost or furthest, most remote
in any direction, final or last,\" as used by the court to define
\"extreme,\" would seem to require a state of mind so far from the norm
as to be characteristic of a mental illness. The defense was meant to be
understood in more relative terms as referring to a loss of self-control
due to intense feelings.

...

We have still to determine how a jury is to determine whether there was
a reasonable explanation for the emotional disturbance. This is a
sensitive task because the Oregon statute requires that the
\"reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance shall be
determined from the standpoint of an ordinary person,\" ORS 163.135(1).
On the other hand, the statute requires that the reasonableness of the
interpretation must be judged from the standpoint of \"the actor\'s
situation under the circumstances as the actor reasonably believes them
to be.\" The juxtaposition of these two requirements for determining the
adequacy of the explanation prevents the adequacy from being determined
on either wholly objective or subjective grounds. The words \"ordinary
person\" and \"reasonableness of the explanation\" recall the reasonable
man standard of the heat of passion defense, which is an objective test,
while the requirement of taking into account the actor\'s situation
suggests a more subjective analysis...

Donovan and Wildman in their article, Is the Reasonable Man Obsolete? A
Critical Perspective on Self-Defense and Provocation, hypothesize the
following example:

An Asian-American man, Harold Sato, who had been interned in a detention
camp for Japanese during World War II, faces repeated racial prejudice
at his job. One day after repeated racial slurs from a co-worker he
kills the co-worker. 14 Loyola L.Rev. 435, 438 (1981). 

 

The authors observe:

 

The anomaly of a purely objective standard of provocation is underlined
by Mr. Sato\'s case \* \* \*. A reasonable man, viewed in the abstract,
is not likely to be roused to the heat of passion by a verbal insult.
However, an Asian-American who had been interned in a concentration
camp is likely to be roused to the heat of passion by racial slurs. To
the extent that a jury is not allowed to consider Mr. Sato\'s racial
background and previous experience of racial discrimination in
determining his moral culpability, Mr. Sato is more likely to be
convicted of murder \* \* \* than of voluntary manslaughter. Id at 449.

 

By requiring the factfinder to focus on a person in the defendant\'s
\"situation,\" the drafters of the Model Penal Code sought to work
change. One writer, relying upon the Model Penal Code commentary, has
put it:

\[I\]t makes the test more, although not entirely, subjective, by
requiring the jury to test the reasonableness of the actor\'s conduct,
'from the viewpoint of a person in the actor\'s situation.' Thus, the
actor\'s sex, sexual preference, pregnancy, physical deformities, and
similar characteristics are apt to be taken into consideration in
evaluating the reasonableness of the defendant\'s behavior. (Footnotes
omitted.) Dressler, Rethinking Heat of Passion: A Defense in Search of a
Rationale, 73 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 421, 431 (1982).

Conclusion

Given the hybrid approach adopted by the legislature to the weight to be
accorded to subjective and objective factors in the calculus involved in
this kind of case, we do not believe that any court can state a
suggested jury instruction that is completely impervious to criticism of
its logic. We must leave the trial courts and juries where the statute
places them. Making the best of this situation, we conclude that a trial
court\'s charge must be constructed for any particular case along the
following general lines.

First, the jury\'s attention must be drawn to the relevant statutory
text.

Second, the jury must be instructed as to the burden of persuasion on
the issue.

Third, the jury should be asked to consider whether the homicide was
committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. It was
if the defendant was under the influence of an emotional disturbance to
the extent that he lost the capacity to control himself and forego the
homicide. The jury should be instructed that if it finds that the
homicide was not committed under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance, the jury need not further consider the issue of mitigation
of murder to manslaughter. If the jury finds that the homicide was
committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, it must
then consider other issues.

Fourth, the jury must determine whether the extreme emotional
disturbance was the result of the defendant\'s intentional, knowing,
reckless or criminally negligent act, and the meaning of those
adjectives must be explained. If the jury finds that this causal
relationship existed, it need not further consider the mitigation issue.
If the jury finds this causal relationship not to exist, it must then
consider the reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance.

Fifth, the jury must determine what was the defendant\'s situation in
the circumstances which the defendant reasonably believed to exist. The
jury must then determine whether an ordinary person in that situation
and those circumstances would have experienced extreme emotional
disturbance.

In the case at bar, the trial court erred in instructing the jury ....
The error went to the heart of the case. The error was not harmless.
Defendant is entitled to a new trial.

Reversed and remanded for a new trial.

Notes and Questions for State v. Ott

 

1\. Elements of extreme emotional distress: Defendant must prove by
preponderance of the evidence that (a) the emotional disturbance is not
a mental disease or defect equivalent to insanity, (b) the defendant
experienced a particularly overwhelming situation, and (c) the defendant
had an extreme emotional reaction to it, resulting in a loss of
self-control, which was overcome by powerful emotions, such as passion,
anger, or fear.  See State v. Elliott, 177 Conn. 1, 411 A.2d 3 (1979).

Per Model Penal Code Section 210.3:

\(1\) Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:

\(b\) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the
influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is
reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation
or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the
actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.

 

2\. A man from Kentucky by the name of Bob is the father of a seventeen
year-old daughter, Annamae. He has never shown any propensity towards
violence nor does he generally look at acts of violence favorably. Bob
holds a belief, however, that Californians are infected with a certain
parasite that can kill Kentuckians with whom they are in physical
contact. Bob sees Annamae talking with Chad, her friend from California.
Bob also sees her touching his hand. Jim Bob becomes fearful for
Annamae's life and tells Chad to let go of her hand. Chad lets go, looks
at Bob in bewilderment, and says, "Dude, you gotta chill, what is going
on?" This only makes Jim Bob more furious because of Chad's apparent
lack of concern for Annamae's safety, at which point Bob pulls out his
revolver and shoots and kills Chad. In view of Ott, how should this case
be analyzed.

 

3\. Suppose a prisoner becomes upset at how a guard is treating him. In
particular, the guard accuses the prisoner of wearing something not
allowed in prison, and the guard tries to remove the article of clothing
from the prisoner. The prisoner extricates himself from the situation,
goes back to his cell, grabs a shiv, and then returns to stab the guard.
What would be the result of pleading extreme emotional distress per the
Model Penal Code? What about "heat of passion" per the common law
approach? Does the stressful environment of prison, combined with abuse
from the prison guards, justify stabbing the guard when the guard tried
to forcibly take something from the prisoner that the prisoner sees as
valuable?  See Johnson v. State, 2016 Ark. 156, 489 S.W.3d 668 (2016).

 

4\. Can a more subjective analysis mitigate homicides? Many intimate
partner homicides occur after "departure claims," where the decedent
announces in deeds such as moving furniture out or words such as filing
for divorce or stating future plans that she is leaving the
relationship. Victoria Nourse, Passion's Progress: Modern Law Reform and
the Provocation Defense, 106 Yale L.J. 1331, 1353 (1997). Professor
Victoria Nourse, who compared cases that apply the MPC's "extreme mental
or emotional disturbance" to cases that use common law standards, found
that 26% of MPC claims that reached juries involved "departure" claims,
whereas none of these claims reached juries in jurisdictions using the
common law approach. Id. at 1352. Essentially, when cases were able to
reach juries, there was a question of fact that needed answering, which
allows for more evidence to be submitted. In many cases, the victim was
killed when she moved furniture out, announced her departure, or filed
for divorce. Professor Nourse further discovered that when a defendant
in a criminal homicide case alleged infidelity after the relationship
had ended, the case would reach the jury 88% of the time in MPC states
versus 39% of the time in common law jurisdictions. Id. at 1362. With
these results in mind, Professor Nourse concluded that the MPC produced
"illiberal and often perverse" results. Id. at 1332. What do you think?

 

5\. Voluntary manslaughter has been said to "ha\[ve\] never been a
female-friendly doctrine." Emily L. Miller, (Wo)manslaughter: Voluntary
Manslaughter, Gender, and the Model Penal Code, 50 Emory L.J. 665, 667
(2001). Some scholars have even called for the abolition of the
heat-of-passion factor, and the argument is summarized as follows:

Provocation is a male-centered and male-dominated defense. Although the
defense is supposedly founded on compassion for ordinary human
infirmity, it is really a legal disguise to partially excuse male
aggression by treating men "as natural aggressors, and in particular
women\'s natural aggressors." Men who are provoked desire to inflict
retaliatory suffering on those who have attacked their self-worth. More
often than not, the self-worth "attackers" are women. In studies of
battered women, for example, violence is prompted by male possessiveness
and sexual jealousy; a male\'s feelings of self-worth require "absolute
possession of a woman\'s sexual fidelity, of her labour, and of (on
demand) her presence, love, and attention in general." In reality,
therefore, the defense simply reinforces precisely what the law should
seek to eradicate, namely, "men\'s violence against women, and their
violence in general." Joshua Dressler, Why Keep the Provocation
Defense?: Some Reflections on A Difficult Subject, 86 Minn. L. Rev. 959,
975-976 (2002).

 

Professor Nourse is in favor of keeping the provocation defense, \[FN
1\] but making it available in fewer circumstances, because "the
defendant's claim to our compassion must put him in a position of
normative equality vis-a-vis his victim." She further comments that this
only exists when society "shares" the defendant's rage, such that the
provoker's conduct would result in criminal punishment. Victoria Nourse,
Passion's Progress: Modern Law Reform and the Provocation Defense, 106
Yale L.J. 1331, 1396 (1997). Because adultery is no longer a crime in
almost all jurisdictions, this would lead to a revocation of a
provocation defense when a defendant kills in the heat of passion that
stems from the victim's infidelity. Thus, without any other defenses or
mitigating factors being available, the defendant would be guilty of
murder. 

 

Regarding the viewpoints regarding keeping versus abolishing the
defense, which of these do you find more persuasive? Would it be better
to abolish provocation as a defense? Or do you think it would be better
to retain the defense, and if so, do you prefer the common law
heat-of-passion doctrine or the MPC's "extreme mental or emotional
disturbance" provision? 

\[FN 1\]: Professor Nourse observed that "use \[of\] provocation to
reduce first- to second-degree homicide may exist as an important safety
valve restricting the potential for the death penalty; \* \* \*
provocation may \[also\] act as a kind of antidote for stringent
self-defense rules. These \* \* \* factors are why proposals for
abolition may be far too simple." V.F. Nourse, Upending Status: A
Comment on Switching, Inequality, and the Idea of the Reasonable Person,
2 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 361, 364-64 n.11 (2004).

 

6\. If we were to abolish provocation as a mitigating factor, how might
we replace it? Should it be replaced, or should it be removed entirely?
The United Kingdom replaced provocation as a mitigating factor with the
statutory partial defense called "loss of control" as codified in the
Coroners and Justice Act (2009):

 

1\. Where a person ("D") kills or is a party to the killing of another
("V"), D is not to be convicted of murder if-

a\. D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing
resulted from D's loss of self-control,

b\. the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and

c\. a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and
self-restraint and in the cirumstnaces of D, might have reacted in the
same or in a similar way to D.

2\. For the purpose of subsection (1)(a), it does not matter whether or
not the loss of control was sudden.

3\. In subsection (1)(c) , the reference to "the circumstances of D" is
a reference to all of D's circumstances other than those whose only
relevance to D's conduct is that they bear on D's general capacity for
tolerance or self-restraint.

Under this Act, a "qualifying trigger" for D's loss of self-control is
one attributable to:

1\. D's fear of serious violence from V against D or "another identified
person"; or

2\. a thing or things done or said (or both) which-

a\. constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and

b\. caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged; or

3\. a combination of the matters mentioned \[above\].

Unintentional Homicide

 

 

 

 

[]{#_auto_toc_74 .anchor}6.5.1

Involuntary Manslaughter and Similar Offenses

 

The intentional homicides we just studied required us to differentiate
between what were clearly blameworthy acts. Unintentional homicide poses
a different problem: how to distinguish between criminal deaths and
noncriminal deaths, when the perpetrator did not act with purpose to
kill or with knowledge that his conduct would result in killing. When is
a death deemed the result of someone's criminal negligence or
recklessness, and when is it a horrible accident that does not result in
criminal liability? Some of the cases in this section present unsavory
and unsympathetic protagonists; you may be able to empathize with
others. Consider what the courts in each case think the defendants did
wrong, and what legal tests they use to make those determinations.

Teaching Memo on Involuntary Manslaughter

 

By Angela Madrigal, Cydney Chilimidos, and Zachary Nemirovsky

**[*People v. Knoller* and its notes]{.underline}**

            *People v. Knoller* is a dismal, but memorable 2007 case
from the Supreme Court of California. The case falls under the section
in the casebook regarding unintentional killings arising from
unjustified risk-taking, which can constitute either murder or
manslaughter. The court decides that the facts of this case constitute
murder. In its discussion, the court attempts to clarify *implied
malice*---defined as "abandoned and malignant heart" in the applicable
California statute---by emphasizing that the defendant must act with an
awareness that the act endangers human life and must have a conscious
disregard for life. The notes following the case work well to have
students think about whether this definition adequately explains the
state of mind required for unjustified risk-taking to amount to murder.
Another note asks whether unintentional, depraved heart killings should
always be considered less culpable than intentional killings and
provides hypothetical situations to consider in answering this question.
However, there are many other engaging aspects of the case, which may be
provided to interested students as optional reading.

For one, Knoller was a practicing attorney at the time of the events,
which raises the issue of professional responsibility. California
attorneys are subject to the California Rules of Professional Conduct,
adopted by the State Bar of California and approved by the Supreme Court
of California in order to promote the administration of justice, protect
the public, and uphold the integrity of the legal
system.[^\[1\]^](#Xd4af478428f703362bba05634de8672094d6551) These rules
establish standards of professional conduct for lawyers that, when
violated, act as a basis for discipline. Lawyers are also bound by
applicable law, including the State Bar Act (Business and Professions
Code section 6000 *et seq.*); bound by opinions of California courts;
and are advised to consult the opinions of ethics committees in
California.[^\[2\]^](#X853caf02b5429ff5b52c25bf5d73a5ff7517cde) So, when
an attorney commits a criminal act, they may be in violation of an
applicable Penal Code section and subject to punishment under criminal
law, and they may also be in violation of Rule
8.4(b)[^\[3\]^](#X5b0834f3795296864eefe8aa6af407702be8337) of the Rules
of Professional Conduct and subject to discipline under the applicable
Business and Professions Code sections. A conviction of a felony or
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude---and in fact any act involving
moral turpitude---constitutes a cause for disbarment or
suspension[^\[4\]^](#Xc13c175474710d00c26d0f54e4577015d3e34eb) by the
California Supreme
Court,[^\[5\]^](#X4b52b2de1f34346ad41328cb2c9116aebb228b8) which often
accords great weight to the recommendation of discipline by the
California State
Bar.[^\[6\]^](#X438b58aa2163beef29a1f964ae4889394094f18) Moral turpitude
has been defined as an act of "baseness, vileness or depravity in the
private and social duties which a \[person\] owes to\...society" and as
an act "contrary to justice, honesty, modesty, or good
morals."[^\[7\]^](#X73899b04f6f319aeb21fca8e172b558fef55726)
Unsurprisingly, murder constitutes an act of moral
turpitude.[^\[8\]^](#X1d490b10264065ecb2ea82498c4fe78263169b8) However,
it is important to recognize that other misconduct, even that not
involving moral turpitude, may lead to discipline. For example, one
attorney was placed on disciplinary probation for three years after
being convicted on two occasions of driving under the influence (under
Vehicle Code section
23152).[^\[9\]^](#Xab751f5b7dbb77679bf10e37a1386456daba818) To get an
idea of other misconduct and the disciplinary measures taken, students
can view discipline summaries based on discipline orders listed on the
California State Bar
website.[^\[10\]^](#X2b79cd5545feb04d09e65ebde51d8933be52a80)

Second, the case also mentions that Paul Schneider---the individual with
whom Knoller was involved with---was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood,
a white supremacist prison gang. With Knoller's help, Schneider was able
to organize a dog-breeding operation while in prison.  These facts
elicitinquiries about the relationship between the
parties,[^\[11\]^](#X24f85a7ea74cd7641f857fea8e811ca1fc76d23) other
methods used and operations organized by the Aryan
Brotherhood,[^\[12\]^](#Xaf9d78a779c1d7f017f7f0f41cb6a1690ee1c1c) and
prison gangs in
general.[^\[13\]^](#X0749ec437ac923a9839fafeff5a7e280ff18a4c)

Lastly, there are two other "fun facts" that may be provided regarding
other individuals involved in the case. Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was one
of the prosecutors in the case, also did some modeling, acting, was
first lady of San Francisco while she was married to (then mayor) Gavin
Newsom, was a host on Fox News, and later joined the Trump campaign.
Sharon Smith, Diane Whipple's partner, became an activist for the LGBT
community. Along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights and
attorney Michael Cardoza, Smith paved the way for same-sex partners to
be able to sue for wrongful
death.[^\[14\]^](#X64b7796fc30a5af32d7c124a5ced896c3c3b9c1)

So, with all of that in mind, *Knoller* as a case should be retained,
but the discussion surrounding it expanded as time permits, along with
supplemental readings. In particular, a discussion about professional
responsibility, moral turpitude, and a short tangent about wrongful
death is likely merited.  For supplemental readings, the Rolling Stone
article (footnote 17) and NCL rights article (footnote 20) are
particularly intriguing and inspiring.

 

**[*State v. Williams* and its notes]{.underline}**

            *State v. Williams* is a highly problematic case coming out
of the Court of Appeals of Washington in 1971.  It is meant to
demonstrate an example of unjustified-risk taking that amounts to
manslaughter, rather than murder. However, in Washington at that time,
only ordinary negligence was required under the manslaughter statute.
Importantly, this standard is nearly non-existent today and, four years
later, Washington redrafted its statute to require gross, or criminal,
negligence. Furthermore, there are serious issues of racial and cultural
oppression. Although we recognize that it is important that students are
aware of the legal history and unjust treatment of minority groups,
unless professors can commit to discussing the problematic nature of the
systemic devices involved, we recommend that the case be replaced with
one that applies a criminal standard of negligence and does not include
as many triggering racial issues.

            This case emphasizes the fact that the Williams are young
Shoshone[\[15\]](#X524d2f43b8535200a71ff1174f3dec680d3fef2) Indians, one
with a middle school education and one with a high school education. It
goes on to state that the parents have a "natural duty" to provide
medical care for their children, but the case fails to discuss that
these same parents were afraid that if they performed this duty, Child
Protective Services (CPS) would have likely been called by the medical
professionals treating the child. The United States has an insidious
history of removing children of Native American parents from their homes
and forcing them into the already overwhelmed foster care system, as a
way to uphold white supremacy and quash the preservation of Indigenous
cultures. As mentioned in the case notes, between 1958 and 1967, the
Child Welfare League of America campaigned to remove Native-American
children from their families and place them with white families. The
removal of these children became so commonplace that in 1978 Congress
passed the Indian Child Welfare Act to "protect the best interests of
Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian
tribes and
families."[^\[16\]^](#X87e3140a92ff396a729f2f2287f9a56abb532cb)
According to the National Indian Child Welfare Association, at this
period of time, 25-35% of Native children were removed from their
families, and of those, 85% were placed outside of their families and
communities, even if relatives were fit and willing to take the children
in.[^\[17\]^](#X459ed729a1cdf8a40f5dce721266208b93ced7b) Considering
these circumstances, Walter and Bernice Williams are incredibly
justified in their fear that CPS would intervene.

            Not only do these facts need to be discussed in class to
create a broader context surrounding the issues faced by Indigenous
populations at this particular time in American history, but we also
should discuss how the United States government continually upholds
systemic racism under the guise of "justice." Note 2 in the Dressler
casebook should be emphasized as a way to get students talking about the
inherent racism within the system. If the purpose of the case is to get
students discussing the differences between gross and ordinary
negligence, we need to discuss who we, as people who are perpetuating a
system, perceive as being the "reasonable person" and who we allow to
explain away their negligent behaviors as accidental or mistaken, as
hinted upon in Notes 3 and 6.

Furthermore, if the case and an appropriate discussion regarding the
case are included in the syllabus, we specifically recommend excluding
Note 11 about a man dying of a heart attack while strapped to replica of
a medieval torture device during dominatrix services. It is a strange
and unnecessary note that provides no benefit in regard to student
understanding of involuntary manslaughter (there is absolutely no
discussion or analysis in the case note).

In the case that a professor would rather not dedicate class time to the
issues described above, the case should not be kept. Keeping the case
without discussion would be ignoring issues that affect many students
and would be frustrating and distracting to the purposes of the course.

In that event, *Walker v. Superior Court*, 47 Cal. 3d 112 (1988)
mentioned in Note 9 on page 328, serves as a good replacement case.
First, as far as learning the law is concerned, *Walker,* like
*Williams,* involves the negligence of a parent causing the death of a
child, but without including as many triggering and complicated issues
as does *Williams*. Furthermore, this case applies a criminal negligence
standard, rather than the ordinary negligence standard used in
*Williams*, which is a more accurate reflection of the law as it stands
today. Additionally, just like *Williams*, this case would allow
students to learn about issues regarding concurrence of the elements.
Although a discussion of concurrence of the elements is not directly
present in the case, the fact pattern lends itself to such a topic due
to the lengthy illness of the child. Just like *Williams*, the question
can be asked: at what point did the defendant have a duty to seek
medical care, and at what point was it too late? Finally, this case
provides an opportunity for a class discussion about the view that the
criminal justice system takes in regard to a defendant's religious
beliefs. This provides some nuance to the case, without requiring the
amount of time that would have to be devoted to the myriad of issues in
*Williams*.

People v. Knoller

 

Supreme Court of California

41 Cal. 4th 139

No. S134543

2007-05-31

KENNARD, J.

On January 26, 2001, two dogs owned by defendant Marjorie Knoller and
her husband, codefendant Robert Noel, attacked and killed Diane Whipple
in the hallway of an apartment building in San Francisco. Defendant
Knoller was charged with second degree murder (Pen. Code, § 189)[**\[
... \]**](#Xd5658d93d30f71e31822d5f32457811baf45ef5); codefendant Noel,
who was not present at the time of the attack on Whipple, was charged
with involuntary manslaughter but not murder. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

I. Facts and Proceedings

In 1998, Pelican Bay State Prison inmates Paul Schneider and Dale
Bretches, both members of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, sought to
engage in a business of buying, raising, and breeding Presa Canario
dogs. This breed of dog tends to be very large, weighing over 100
pounds, and reaching over five feet tall when standing on its hind legs.
A document found in defendants' apartment describes the Presa Canario as
"a gripping dog **\[ ... \]** always used and bred for combat and guard
. . . \[and\] used extensively for fighting . . . ."

Prisoners Schneider and Bretches relied on outside contacts, including
Brenda Storey and Janet Coumbs, to carry out their Presa Canario
business. Schneider told Coumbs that she should raise the dogs.

As of May 1990, Coumbs possessed four such dogs, named Bane, Isis, Hera,
and Fury. Hera and Fury broke out of their fenced yard and attacked
Coumbs's sheep. Hera killed at least one of the sheep and also a cat
belonging to Coumbs's daughter. Coumbs acknowledged that Bane ate his
doghouse and may have joined Fury in killing a sheep.

Defendants Knoller and Noel, who were attorneys representing a prison
guard at Pelican Bay State Prison, met inmate Schneider at the prison
sometime in 1999. In October 1999, defendants filed a lawsuit on behalf
of Brenda Storey against Coumbs over the ownership and custody of the
four dogs. Coumbs decided not to contest the lawsuit and to turn the
dogs over to defendants. Coumbs warned Knoller that the dogs had killed
Coumbs's sheep, but Knoller did not seem to care.

Defendant Knoller thereafter contacted Dr. Donald Martin, a veterinarian
for 49 years, and on March 26, 2000, he examined and vaccinated the
dogs. With his bill to Knoller, Dr. Martin included a letter, which said
in part: "I would be professionally amiss \[sic\] if I did not mention
the following, so that you can be prepared. These dogs are huge,
approximately weighing in the neighborhood of 100 pounds each. They have
had no training or discipline of any sort. **\[ ... \]***T*hese animals
would be a liability in any household, reminding me of the recent attack
in Tehama County to a boy by large dogs. He lost his aim and disfigured
his face. The historic romance of the warrior dog, the personal guard
dog, the gaming dog, etc. may sound good but hardly fits into life
today." Knoller thanked Dr. Martin for the information and said she
would pass it on to her client.

On April 1, 2000, both defendants and a professional dog handler took
custody of the dogs from Coumbs. Bane then weighed 150 pounds and Hera
130 pounds. Coumbs told both defendants that she was worried about the
dogs, that Hera and Fury should be shot, and that she was also concerned
about Bane and Isis.

**\[ ... \]**On April 30, 2000, defendants brought Hera to their
sixth-floor apartment at 2398 Pacific Avenue in San Francisco. Bane
arrived in September 2000. Codefendant Noel purchased dog licenses,
registering himself and Knoller as the dogs' owners.

A later search of defendants' apartment showed that they frequently
exchanged letters with Pelican Bay inmates Schneider and Bretches. **\[
... \]**In the letters, defendants discussed a commercial breeding
operation, considering various names such as GuerraHund Kennels, Wardog,
and finally settling on Dog-O-War. Prisoners Schneider and Bretches's
notes on a Web site for the business described Bane as "Wardog," and
"Bringer of Death: Ruin: Destruction."

Between the time defendants Noel and Knoller brought the dogs to their
sixth-floor apartment in San Francisco and the date of the fatal mauling
of Diane Whipple on January 26, 2001, there were about 30 incidents of
the two dogs being out of control or threatening humans and other dogs.
**\[ ... \]**

When neighbors complained to defendants Noel and Knoller about the two
dogs, defendants responded callously, if at all. **\[ ... \]**

There were also instances when defendants' two dogs attacked or
threatened people. David Moser, a fellow resident in the apartment
building, slipped by defendants Knoller and Noel in the hallway only to
have their dog Hera bite him on the "rear end." When he exclaimed, "Your
dog just bit me," Noel replied, "Um, interesting." Neither defendant
apologized to Moser or reprimanded the dog. Another resident, Jill Cowen
Davis, was eight months pregnant when one of the dogs, in the presence
of both Knoller and Noel, suddenly growled and lunged toward her stomach
with its mouth open and teeth bared. Noel jerked the dog by the leash,
but he did not apologize to Davis. Postal carrier John Watanabe
testified that both dogs, unleashed, had charged him. He said the dogs
were in a "snarling frenzy" and he was "terrified for \[his\] life."
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Mauling victim Diane Whipple and her partner Sharon Smith lived in a
sixth-floor apartment across a lobby from defendants. Smith encountered
defendants' two dogs as often as once a week. In early December 2000,
Whipple called Smith at work to say, with some panic in her voice, that
one of the dogs had bitten her. Whipple had come upon codefendant Noel
in the lobby with one of the dogs, which lunged at her and bit her in
the hand. Whipple did not seek medical treatment for three deep, red
indentations on one hand. Whipple made every effort to avoid defendants'
dogs, checking the hallway before she went out and becoming anxious
while waiting for the elevator for fear the dogs would be inside. She
and Smith did not complain to apartment management because they wanted
nothing to do with defendants Knoller and Noel.

On January 26, 2001, Whipple telephoned Smith to say she was going home
early. At 4:00 p.m., Esther Birkmaier, a neighbor who lived across the
hall from Whipple, heard dogs barking and a woman's "panic-stricken"
voice calling, "Help me, help me." Looking through the peephole in her
front door, Birkmaier saw Whipple lying facedown on the floor just over
the threshold of her apartment with what appeared to be a dog on top of
her. Birkmaier saw no one else in the hallway. Afraid to open the door,
Birkmaier called 911, the emergency telephone number, and at the same
time heard a voice yelling, "No, no, no" and "Get off." When Birkmaier
again approached her door, she could hear barking and growling directly
outside and a banging against a door. She heard a voice yell, "Get off,
get off, no, no, stop, stop." **\[ ... \]**

At 4:12 p.m., San Francisco Police Officers Sidney Laws and Leslie
Forrestal arrived in response to Birkmaier's telephone calls. They saw
Whipple's body in the hallway; her clothing had been completely ripped
off, her entire body was covered with wounds, and she was bleeding
profusely. **\[ ... \]**

An emergency medical technician administered first aid to Whipple, who
had a large, profusely bleeding wound to her neck. The wound was too
large to halt the bleeding, and Whipple's pulse and breathing stopped as
paramedics arrived. She was revived but died shortly after reaching the
hospital.

An autopsy revealed over 77 discrete injuries covering Whipple's body
"from head to toe." The most significant were lacerations damaging her
jugular vein and her carotid artery and crushing her larynx, injuries
typically inflicted by predatory animals to kill their prey. The medical
examiner stated that although earlier medical attention would have
increased Whipple's chances of survival, she might ultimately have died
anyway because she had lost one-third or more of her blood at the scene.
Plaster molds of the two dogs' teeth showed that the bite injuries to
Whipple's neck were consistent with Bane's teeth.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** Defendant Knoller did testify in her own defense. **\[ ...
\]** She denied reading literature in the apartment referring to the
vicious nature of the dogs. She thought the dogs had no personality
problems requiring a professional trainer. She denied receiving or
otherwise discounted any warnings about the two dogs' behavior and she
maintained that virtually all the witnesses testifying to incidents with
the dogs were lying. **\[ ... \]**

Asked whether she denied responsibility for the attack on Whipple,
Knoller gave this reply: "I said in an interview that I wasn't
responsible but it wasn't for the---it wasn't in regard to what Bane had
done, it was in regard to knowing whether he would do that or not. And I
had no idea that he would ever do anything like that to anybody. How can
you anticipate something like that? It's a totally bizarre event. I mean
how could you anticipate that a dog that you know that is gentle and
loving and affectionate would do something so horrible and brutal and
disgusting and gruesome to anybody? How could you imagine that
happening?"

**\[ ... \]**

II\. The Elements of Implied Malice

Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice
aforethought. (§ 187, subd. (a).) Malice may be express or implied. (§
188.) At issue here is the definition of "implied malice."

**\[ ... \]**Second degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human
being with malice aforethought but without the additional elements, such
as willfulness, premeditation, and deliberation, that would support a
conviction of first degree murder. (See §§ 187, subd. (a), 189.) Section
188 provides: "\[Mjalice may be either express or implied. It is express
when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of
a fellow creature. It is implied, when no considerable provocation
appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an
abandoned and malignant heart."

The statutory definition of implied malice, a killing by one with an
"abandoned and malignant heart" (§ 188), is far from clear in its
meaning. Indeed, an instruction in the statutory language could be
misleading, for it "could lead the jury to equate the malignant heart
with an evil disposition or a despicable character" *(People v.
Phillips, supra,* 64 Cal.2d at p. 587) instead of focusing on a
defendant's awareness of the risk created by his or her behavior. "Two
lines of decisions developed, reflecting judicial attempts 'to translate
this amorphous anatomical characterization of implied malice into a
tangible standard a jury can apply.' " *(People v. Nieto Benitez* (1992)
4 Cal.4th 91, 103 \[13 Cal.Rptr.2d 864, 840 P.2d 969\], quoting *People*
v. *Protopappas* (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 152, 162-163 \[246 Cal.Rptr.
915\].) Under both lines of decisions, implied malice requires a
defendant's awareness of the risk of death to another.

The earlier of these two lines of decisions, **\[ ... \]**originated in
**\[ ... \]***People v. Thomas* (1953) 41 Cal.2d 470, 480 \[261 P.2d
1\], which stated that malice is implied when "the defendant for a base,
antisocial motive and with wanton disregard for human life, does an act
that involves a high degree of probability that it will result in
death." **\[ ... \]** The later line dates from this court's 1966
decision in *People v. Phillips,* supra, 64 Cal.2d at page 587: Malice
is implied when the killing is proximately caused by " 'an act, the
natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was
deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers
the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life.'
"**\[ ... \]**

In *People v. Watson* (1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 300 \[179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637
P.2d 279\], we held that these two definitions of implied malice in
essence articulated the same standard. Concerned, however, that juries
might have difficulty understanding the *Thomas* test's concept of
"wanton disregard for human life," we later emphasized that the "better
practice in the future is to charge juries solely in the straightforward
language of the 'conscious disregard for human life' definition of
implied malice," the definition articulated in the *Phillips* test. **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The Court of Appeal's judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to
that court, with directions to return the case to the trial court for
reconsideration of defendant Knoller's new trial motion in accord with
the views expressed in this opinion.

George, C. J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Moreno, J., and
Corrigan, J., concurred.

The petition of appellant The People for a rehearing was denied July 18,
2007.

Notes & Questions (People v. Knoller)

 

**Notes and Questions**

1\. *Aftermath.* In 2019, Marjorie Knoller became eligible for parole
and was subsequently denied. The parole board will decide on her parole
status again in 2022. Knoller's husband, Robert Noel, served four years
for involuntary manslaughter and died in June 2018 in a La Jolla nursing
home.[^\[1\]^](#Xc217c44f9d6f9d647df03178eb8b64fb8f54252)

2\. *Test Your Thinking.* Based on the law set out in the case, applied
to the facts of the case, should Knoller be convicted of 2nd degree
murder or should the conviction be mitigated to a lesser offense?
Explain your reasoning.

3\. *Implied Malice.* In its discussion, the court attempts to clarify
*implied malice*---defined as "abandoned and malignant heart" in the
applicable California statute---by emphasizing that the defendant must
act with an awareness that the act endangers human life and must have a
conscious disregard for life. Should depraved heart killings should
always be considered less culpable than intentional killings?

4\. *Professional Responsibility*. Recall that Knoller was more than
just a layperson: she was an attorney. Did she have any heightened
responsibility in her actions?

California attorneys are subject to the California Rules of Professional
Conduct, adopted by the State Bar of California and approved by the
Supreme Court of California in order to promote the administration of
justice, protect the public, and uphold the integrity of the legal
system.[^\[2\]^](#X424ae1dfb199fdaa161d17bdce77f94503db3d6) These rules
establish standards of professional conduct for lawyers that, when
violated, act as a basis for discipline.

Lawyers are also bound by applicable law, including the State Bar Act
(Business and Professions Code section 6000 *et seq.*); bound by
opinions of California courts; and are advised to consult the opinions
of ethics committees in
California.[^\[3\]^](#Xcd2106d7bad008753f2338f3adbb3432843d57e) So, when
an attorney commits a criminal act, they may be in violation of an
applicable Penal Code section and subject to punishment under criminal
law, and they may also be in violation of Rule
8.4(b)[^\[4\]^](#X2e9d117da599c9eb7bd54841919101cb87fe1fd) of the Rules
of Professional Conduct and subject to discipline under the applicable
Business and Professions Code sections.

A conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude---and
in fact any act involving moral turpitude---constitutes a cause for
disbarment or
suspension[^\[5\]^](#X4b29ec9cadcdc1c8ba724b6e5b4f4559b5688bb) by the
California Supreme
Court,[^\[6\]^](#X103389b9c33fa79a31f2931510ace2b56f64b4f) which often
accords great weight to the recommendation of discipline by the
California State
Bar.[^\[7\]^](#X6f87972def47ac9a6eeb391d9f68f65a6ab9193) Moral turpitude
has been defined as an act of "baseness, vileness or depravity in the
private and social duties which a \[person\] owes to\...society" and as
an act "contrary to justice, honesty, modesty, or good
morals."[^\[8\]^](#Xfbbe8b292439c3e69b484bac8f426dbc29dd888)
Unsurprisingly, murder constitutes an act of moral
turpitude.[^\[9\]^](#X6e1a912266c1607f32cebce2494e874e617747d) However,
it is important to recognize that other misconduct, even that not
involving moral turpitude, may lead to discipline. For example, one
attorney was placed on disciplinary probation for three years after
being convicted on two occasions of driving under the influence (under
Vehicle Code section
23152).[^\[10\]^](#X79616abe060647b19c22d5542fcb98f7d3685b1)

To get an idea of other misconduct and the disciplinary measures taken,
students can view discipline summaries based on orders listed on the
California State Bar
website.[^\[11\]^](#X13dd5961c180d598a9fd03b182df40f52e28532)

5\. *LGBT Rights and Wrongful Death*. Reckless action such as Knoller's
can lead not only to criminal charges, but to recovery for the victim's
spouse via the tort of "wrongful death."

Sharon Smith, Diane Whipple's partner, became an activist for the LGBT
community. Along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights and
attorney Michael Cardoza, Smith paved the way for same-sex partners to
be able to sue for wrongful
death.[^\[12\]^](#Xfa110441e3b581bc31268e54713fac65cb657a5)

Walker v. Superior Court

 

Supreme Court of California

47 Cal. 3d 112

S.F. No. 24996

1988-11-10

MOSK, J.

We consider in this case whether a prosecution for involuntary
manslaughter (Pen. Code, § 192, subd. (b)) and felony child endangerment
(id., § 273a, subd. (1)) can be maintained against the mother of a child
who died of meningitis after receiving treatment by prayer in lieu of
medical attention. We conclude that the prosecution is permitted by
statute as well as the free exercise and due process clauses of the
state and federal Constitutions.

Defendant Laurie Grouard Walker is a member of the Church of Christ,
Scientist (hereafter the Church). Her four-year-old daughter, Shauntay,
fell ill with flu-like symptoms on February 21, 1984, and four days
later developed a stiff neck. Consistent with the tenets of her
religion, defendant chose to treat the child's illness with prayer
rather than medical care.[^38] Defendant contacted an accredited
Christian Science prayer practitioner who thereafter prayed for Shauntay
and visited the child on two occasions. Defendant also engaged a
Christian Science nurse who attended Shauntay on February 27 and again
on March 6 and 8.[^39] Shauntay nevertheless lost weight, grew
disoriented and irritable during the last week of her illness, and died
on March 9 of acute purulent meningitis after a period of heavy and
irregular breathing. During the 17 days she lay ill, the child received
no medical treatment.

The People charged defendant with involuntary manslaughter and felony
child endangerment based on allegations that her criminal negligence
proximately caused Shauntay's death. Defendant moved to dismiss the
prosecution **\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]** For the reasons set forth below, we reject their
contentions and conclude that defendant can be prosecuted as charged.

I. *Statutory Contentions*

A. *Section 270 as a complete defense to prosecution*

Defendant first contends that the provisions of Penal Code section 270
(hereafter section 270) provide a complete defense to any prosecution
based on her treatment of Shauntay's illness with prayer rather than
medical care. Section 270 enumerates certain necessities that parents
must furnish their children and imposes misdemeanor liability for the
failure to do so. As enacted in 1872, the statute provided that "Every
parent of any child who willfully omits, without lawful excuse, to
perform any duty imposed upon him by law, to furnish necessary food,
clothing, shelter, or medical attendance for such child, is guilty of a
misdemeanor." (Pen. Code (1st ed. 1872) § 270.) The Legislature amended
the provision in 1925 by inserting the phrase "or other remedial care"
after "medical attendance." (Stats. 1925, ch. 325, § 1, p. 544.) The
statute was again amended in 1976 to specify that "treatment by
spiritual means through prayer alone" constitutes "other remedial care."
(Stats. 1976, ch. 673, § 1, p. 1661.)[^40]

1\.

As a threshold consideration we must ascertain whether prayer treatment
constitutes an acceptable substitute for medical care under the terms of
section 270, as defendant contends. If it does not, then a fortiori the
statute provides no defense to prosecutions under separate manslaughter
and child endangerment provisions for the use of prayer in lieu of
medicine. This determination hinges on whether "other remedial care,"
defined in section 270 to include prayer, represents an alternative to
"medical attendance" or rather identifies a distinct and additional
necessity that parents must provide their children.

Any doubt regarding this interpretation cannot survive examination of
the legislative history of the 1976 amendment defining "other remedial
care" to include prayer. When the members of the Assembly considered the
amendment**\[ ... \]** they had before them the third reading analysis
of the legislation prepared by the Assembly Office of Research. The
analysis stated: "Under this bill, the parents may not be liable for
failing to provide for the health of the child because they choose
treatment by prayer rather than common medical treatment . . . ." **\[
... \]**

2\.

We next consider whether section 270 bars the prosecution of defendant
under the manslaughter and child endangerment statutes. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Defendant **\[ ... \]** asserts that the plain language of section 270
requires the extension of its religious exemption to her prosecution.
She focuses on the reference in the statute to the provision of
*"necessary* clothing, food, shelter or medical attendance, or other
remedial care . . . ." **\[ ... \]** Observing that "necessary" is
defined, inter alia, as "absolutely required: essential,
indispensable"**\[ ... \]** she contends that there can be no
circumstance involving the illness of a child in which the use of prayer
in lieu of medicine is unlawful.

It is true that the statute recognizes "other remedial care" as an
acceptable substitute for "medical attendance" when care is "necessary";
however, this conclusion does not address the question whether
compliance with the terms of section 270 absolves defendant of liability
under all other provisions of the Penal Code. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The Legislature has determined that the provision of prayer is
sufficient to avert misdemeanor liability for neglecting one's financial
responsibility to furnish routine child support. This hardly compels the
conclusion that in so doing the Legislature intended to create an
unqualified defense to felony manslaughter and child endangerment
charges for those parents who continue to furnish prayer alone in the
rare instance when a gravely ill child lies dying for want of medical
attention.[^41]

*Click on footnote 8 for the manslaughter statute.*

[^42]

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**The plain language, purpose, and legislative history of
section 270 thus fail to establish a discernible legislative intent to
exempt prayer treatment, as a matter of law, from the reach of the
manslaughter and felony child-endangerment statutes. (Accord, Note,
*California\'s Prayer Healing Dilemma* (1987) 14 Hastings Const.L.Q.
395, 401-404.)

B. *Expressions of legislative intent in related statutes*

*\[The opinion next considers laws defining child abuse and neglect,
which establish the circumstances under which the State can assume
custody of a minor child on the grounds that the parent\'s conduct
endangers the child. It notes that these laws provide that children
receiving treatment by prayer shall not \"for that reason alone\" be
considered abused or neglected. (Welf & Inst. Code, §§ 16509.1 and
18950.5; Pen. Code, § 11165.2.\]*

Defendant cites these provisions as evidence that the Legislature does
not consider prayer treatment to be a threat to the health of children,
and thus that the imposition of criminal liability for the results of
its use is inconsistent with legislative intent.

The *\[State\]* urges a different construction of the statutory
language. *\[It\]* contends that the phrase "for that reason *alone* "
(italics added) denotes that a child receiving prayer treatment can
still fall within the reach of the statutory definitions if the
provision of such treatment, coupled with a grave medical condition,
combine to pose a serious threat to the physical well-being of the
child.[^43] While defendant contends the phrase merely indicates that a
child receiving prayer treatment can come within the purview of the
statutes for other reasons, her construction renders the use of the word
"alone" surplusage and thus must be rejected under the rule that "
'\[ejvery word, phrase and provision employed in a statute is intended
to have meaning and to perform a useful function. . . **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Thus in any circumstance involving the threat of "serious physical harm
or illness," the Legislature has empowered the juvenile court to
intercede and assume custody for the express purpose of assuring medical
care for a child whose parent is furnishing spiritual treatment by
prayer alone. The expression of legislative intent is clear: when a
child's health is seriously jeopardized, the right of a parent to rely
exclusively on prayer must yield. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

C. *Defendant's conduct and the standard for criminal culpability*

Taking a wholly different tack, defendant next contends that she cannot
be convicted under either the manslaughter or felony child-endangerment
statutes regardless of the availability of a religious exemption. She
rests this contention on a claim that the People will be unable to prove
the degree of culpability necessary to convict her under either
provision, both of which require criminal negligence in the commission
of an offending act. *(People* v. *Penny* (1955) 44 Cal.2d 861, 879
\[285 P.2d 926\]; *People* v. *Peabody* (1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 43, 47
\[119 Cal.Rptr. 780\].) We have defined criminal negligence as "
'aggravated, culpable, gross, or reckless, that is, the conduct of the
accused must be such a departure from what would be the conduct of an
ordinarily prudent or careful man under the same circumstances as to be
incompatible with a proper regard for human life, or, in other words, a
disregard of human life or an indifference to consequences. . . . \[Such
negligence\] is ordinarily to be determined pursuant to the general
principles of negligence, the fundamental of which is knowledge, actual
or imputed, that the act of the slayer tended to endanger life.'" **\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Emphasizing her sincere concern and good faith in treating Shauntay with
prayer, she claims that her conduct is incompatible with the required
degree of culpability. Defendant does not dispute, however, that
criminal negligence must be evaluated objectively. **\[ ... \]**The
question is whether "a reasonable person in defendant's position would
have been aware of the risk involved . . . ." **\[ ... \]**If so,
"defendant is presumed to have had such an awareness." **\[ ... \]**

The significance of this principle was well illustrated in *People* v.
*Burroughs* (1984) 35 Cal.3d 824 \[201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894\], a
case involving a "self-styled 'healer' " who provided " 'deep' abdominal
massages" to a leukemic who thereafter died of a massive abdominal
hemorrhage. **\[ ... \]** We observed that "There is no allegation made,
nor was there any evidence adduced at trial, that \[the defendant\] at
any time harbored any intent even to harm \[the victim\] in the
slightest fashion." *(Id.* at p. 834.) "Indeed, nowhere is it claimed
that defendant attempted to perform any action with respect to \[the
victim\] other than to heal him . . . ." **\[ ... \]** Nonetheless, we
determined that the defendant could be charged with criminally negligent
involuntary manslaughter. **\[ ... \]** The relevant inquiry, then,
turns not on defendant's subjective intent to heal her daughter but on
the objective reasonableness of her course of conduct.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe969bfcb1ea40465403bc35338b133f76c4cf20)

In view of this standard, we must reject defendant's assertion that no
reasonable jury could characterize her conduct as criminally negligent
for purposes of sections 192(b) and 273a(l). As the court in *People* v.
*Atkins* (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 348 \[125 Cal.Rptr. 855\], observed in
affirming the involuntary manslaughter and felony child-endangerment
conviction of a parent whose child died for want of medical care,
criminal negligence "could have been found to have consisted of the
\[mother's\] failure to seek prompt medical attention for \[her son\],
rather than waiting several days. There is evidence she knew, or should
have known, that \[her son\] was seriously injured. . . . Viewing \[the
evidence\] in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there is
substantial evidence here of involuntary manslaughter based on the lack
of due caution and circumspection in omitting to take the child to a
doctor." *(Id.* at p. 360.) When divorced of her subjective intent, the
alleged conduct of defendant here is essentially indistinguishable.

**\[ ... \]**

In sum, we reject the proposition that the provision of prayer alone to
a seriously ill child cannot constitute criminal negligence as a matter
of law. Whether this defendant's particular conduct was sufficiently
culpable to justify conviction *of* involuntary manslaughter and felony
child endangerment remains a question in the exclusive province of the
jury.

*\[The Court next discussed and rejects the defendant\'s Constitutional
defense claims (free exercise under the First Amendment)\]*

III\. *Disposition*

We conclude that the prosecution of defendant for involuntary
manslaughter and felony child endangerment violates neither statutory
law nor the California or federal Constitution. The judgment of the
Court of Appeal is affirmed.

Notes & Questions (Walker v. Superior Court)

 

**Notes and Questions**

1.      *Concurrence of the Elements.* Although the court in *Walker*
did not raise this issue, all of the elements of the crime had to be met
in concurrence for guilt to attach. If the Walker had elected for
spiritual care at first (for example, only in the first four days before
stiff-neck developed), but got her daughter medical care when the
illness worsened, would she have been liable?

       No, if it was not too late to save her daughter. In another case,
there was explicit testimony that if medical care was obtained up to
"the last week before the baby's death", it would not have been too late
to save the child. As such, obtaining medical care in the last week
would have been
futile.[^\[1\]^](#X667c8e6e942f47e6dc29bfdd6d9ed6a435b0011)

       In this case, then, the Walker can only be guilty for failing to
seek medical care in the period when her daughter could have been saved.

2.      *Reasonable Negligence.* Was Walker negligent in seeking only
spiritual treatment for her child in the ordinary (tort / civil) sense?
That is, would a reasonable person have done what she did in that
situation? Did it matter that Walker was a Christian Scientist, and
believed in the power of prayer to heal? Should this matter?

       Consider additional fact changes. (1) if Walker was uneducated
about modern medicine, should her level of education matter? (2) If
Walker could not afford medical treatment, should her financial
situation be taken into account?

3.      *Criminal Negligence.* In fact, the standard applied in
California (and almost everywhere else today) is not ordinary
negligence - it is criminal negligence. As the Supreme Court put it,
criminal negligence is "aggravated, culpable, gross, or reckless" such
that the conduct is such a departure from that of an ordinary person "as
to be incompatible with a proper regard for human life." "Gross
negligence" is a quick reference to this concept.

4.      *Objective and Subjective.* Part of the criminal negligence
standard, as discussed above, is objective in asking about the conduct
of an ordinary (reasonable) person. However, there is also a subjective
component:

The test of foresight is not what this very criminal foresaw, but what a
man of reasonable prudence would have foreseen. \[¶\] On the other hand,
there must be actual present knowledge of the present facts which make
an act dangerous. The act is not enough by itself. \* \* \*

\* \* \* For instance, if a workman on a house-top at mid-day knows that
the space below him is a street in a great city, he knows facts from
which a man of common understanding would infer that there were people
passing below. He is therefore bound to draw that inference, or, in
other words, is chargeable with knowledge of that fact also, whether he
draws the inference or not. If, then, he throws down a heavy beam into
the street, he does an act which a person of ordinary prudence would
foresee is likely to cause death, or grievous bodily harm, and he is
dealt with as if he foresaw it, whether he does so in fact or
not.[^\[2\]^](#Xdb1fc626012e43db6a5a30548105f33769b01ff)

5.      *The Model Penal Code.* Look at the Model Penal Code's
definition of negligence in § 2.02(2)(d). Does it contain a subjective
component, as well?

       If Walker were tried in a MPC jurisdiction, what form of homicide
would she be guilty of (if any)?

State v. Williams

 

**\[ ... \]**

**484 P.2d 1167**

**STATE of Washington, Respondent,**\
**v.**\
**Walter L. WILLIAMS \[ ... \]**

**Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 1, Panel One.**

**May 3, 1971.**

 

**\[ ... \]**

HOROWITZ, Chief Judge.

Defendants, husband and wife, were charged by information filed October
3, 1968, with the crime of manslaughter for negligently failing to
supply their 17-month child with necessary medical attention, as a
result of which he died on September 12, 1968. Upon entry of findings,
conclusions and judgment of guilty, sentences were imposed on April 22,
1969. Defendants appeal.

The defendant husband, Walter Williams, is a 24-year old full-blooded
Sheshont Indian with a sixth-grade education. His sole occupation is
that of laborer. The defendant wife, Bernice Williams, is a \[484 P.2d
1170\] 20-year-old part Indian with an 11th grade education. At the time
of the marriage, the wife had two children, the younger of whom was a
14-month son. Both parents worked and the children were cared for by the
85-year-old mother of the defendant husband. The defendant husband
assumed parental responsibility with the defendant wife to provide
clothing, care and medical attention for the child. Both defendants
possessed a great deal of love and affection for the defendant wife\'s
young son.

The court expressly found:

That both defendants were aware that William Joseph \[4 Wn.App. 911\]
Tabafunda was ill during the period September 1, 1968 to September 12,
1968. The defendants were ignorant. They did not realize how sick the
baby was. They thought that the baby had a toothache and no layman
regards a toothache as dangerous to life. They loved the baby and gave
it aspirin in hopes of improving its condition. They did not take the
baby to a doctor because of fear that the Welfare Department would take
the baby away from them. They knew that medical help was available
because of previous experience. They had no excuse that the law will
recognize for not taking the baby to a doctor.

The defendants Walter L. Williams and Bernice J. Williams were negligent
in not seeking medical attention for William Joseph Tabafunda.

That as a proximate result of this negligence, William Joseph Tabafunda
died.

**\[ ... \]**From these and other findings, the court concluded that the
defendants were each guilty of the crime of manslaughter as charged.

Defendants take no exception to findings but contend that the findings
do not support the conclusions that the defendants are guilty of
manslaughter as charged. **\[ ... \]**

Parental duty to provide medical care for a dependent minor child was
recognized at common law and characterized as a natural duty. **\[ ...
\]** On the question of the quality or seriousness of breach of the
duty, at common law, in the case of involuntary manslaughter, the breach
had to amount to more than mere ordinary or simple negligence\--gross
negligence was essential. **\[ ... \]** In Washington, however, RCW
9.48.060 [^\[2\]^](#Xeea30548055ffd96ef03dc1f68c048e3b302744) (since
amended by Laws of 1970, ch. 49, § 2) and RCW 9.48.150
[^\[3\]^](#X6264f9d18fe6336aa1650e698767efce3a1c036) supersede both
voluntary and \[4 Wn.App. 913\] involuntary manslaughter as those crimes
were defined at common law. Under these statutes the crime is deemed
committed even though the death of the victim is the proximate result of
only simple or ordinary negligence. **\[ ... \]**

The information charging statutory manslaughter made no mention of and
did not purport to restrict itself to the violation of the duty set
forth in RCW 26.20.030(1)(b). The information charged the violation of
\'the legal duty of providing necessary \* \* \* medical attention to
said \* \* \* minor child \* \* \*\' This general language permits
reliance upon the existence of the legal duty no matter from what source
derived. We have already pointed out that such a parental duty is
recognized in the decisions of this state and has been characterized as
a natural duty existing independently of statutes. **\[ ... \]**We
therefore hold that the violation of the parental duty to furnish
medical care to a minor dependent child, the other elements of
manslaughter being present, is a sufficient basis on which to rest a
conviction of the crime of manslaughter **\[ ... \]**

In the instant case, however, the defendant husband is not the father of
the minor child, nor has he adopted that child. Nevertheless, the
evidence shows that he had assumed responsibility with his wife for the
care and maintenance of the child, whom he greatly loved. Such
assumption of responsibility, characterized in the information as that
required of a \'guardian and custodian,\' is sufficient to impose upon
him the duty to furnish necessary medical care. **\[ ... \]**

The remaining issue of proximate cause requires consideration of the
question of when the duty to furnish medical care became activated. If
the duty to furnish such care was not activated until after it was too
late to save the life of the child, failure to furnish medical care
could not be said to have proximately caused the child\'s death.
Timeliness in the furnishing of medical care also must be considered in
terms of \'ordinary caution.\' The law does not mandatorily require that
a doctor be called for a child at the first sign of any indisposition or
illness. The indisposition or illness may appear to be of a minor or
very temporary kind, such as a toothache or cold. If one in the exercise
of ordinary caution fails to recognize that his child\'s symptoms
require medical attention, it cannot be said that the failure to obtain
such medical attention is a breach of the duty owed. **\[ ... \]**

Because of the serious nature of the charge against the parent and
step-parent of a well-loved child, and out of our concern for the
protection of the constitutional rights of the defendants, we have made
an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether it
substantially supports the court\'s express finding on proximate cause
and its implied finding that the duty to furnish medical care became
activated in time to prevent death of the child. **\[ ... \]**

Dr. Gale Wilson, the autopsy surgeon and chief pathologist for the King
County Coroner, testified that the child died because an abscessed tooth
had been allowed to develop into an infection of the mouth and cheeks,
eventually becoming gangrenous. This condition, accompanied by the
child\'s inability to eat, brought about malnutrition, lowering the
child\'s resistance and eventually producing pneumonia, causing the
death. Dr. Wilson testified that in his opinion \[4 Wn.App. 918\] the
infection had lasted for approximately 2 weeks, and that the odor
generally associated with gangrene would have been present for
approximately 10 days before death. He also expressed the opinion that
had medical care been first obtained in the last week before the baby\'s
\[484 P.2d 1174\] death, such care would have been obtained too late to
have saved the baby\'s life. Accordingly, the baby\'s apparent condition
between September 1 and September 5, 1968 became the critical period for
the purpose of determining whether in the exercise of ordinary caution
defendants should have provided medical care for the minor child.

The testimony concerning the child\'s apparent condition during the
critical period is not crystal clear, but is sufficient to warrant the
following statement of the matter. The defendant husband testified that
he noticed the baby was sick about 2 weeks before the baby died. The
defendant wife testified that she noticed the baby was ill about a week
and a half or 2 weeks before the baby died. The evidence showed that in
the critical period the baby was fussy; that he could not keep his food
down; and that a cheek started swelling up. The swelling went up and
down, but did not disappear. In that same period, the cheek turned \'a
bluish color like.\' The defendants, not realizing that the baby was as
ill as it was or that the baby was in danger of dying, attempted to
provide some relief to the baby by giving the baby aspirin during the
critical period and continued to do so until the night before the baby
died. The defendants thought the swelling would go down and were waiting
for it to do so; and defendant husband testified, that from what he had
heard, neither doctors nor dentists pull out a tooth \'when it\'s all
swollen up like that.\' There was an additional explanation for not
calling a doctor given by each defendant. Defendant husband testified
that \'the way the cheek looked, \* \* \* and that stuff on his hair,
they would think we were neglecting him and take him away from us and
not give him back.\' Defendant wife testified that the defendants were
\'waiting for the swelling to go down,\' and also that they were afraid
to \[4 Wn.App. 919\] take the child to a doctor for fear that the doctor
would report them to the welfare department, who, in turn, would take
the child away. \'It\'s just that I was so scared of losing him.\' They
testified that they had heard that the defendant husband\'s cousin lost
a child that way. The evidence showed that the defendants did not
understand the significance or seriousness of the baby\'s symptoms.
However, there is no evidence that the defendants were physically or
financially unable to obtain a doctor, or that they did not know an
available doctor, or that the symptoms did not continue to be a matter
of concern during the critical period. Indeed, the evidence shows that
in April 1968 defendant husband had taken the child to a doctor for
medical attention.

In our opinion, there is sufficient evidence from which the court could
find, as it necessarily did, that applying the standard of ordinary
caution, I.e., the caution exercisable by a man of reasonable prudence
under the same or similar conditions, defendants were sufficiently put
on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby\'s illness and lack of
improvement in the baby\'s apparent condition in the period from
September 1 to September 5, 1968 to have required them to have obtained
medical care for the child. The failure so to do in this case is
ordinary or simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to
support a conviction of statutory manslaughter.

The judgment is affirmed.

### ELIZABETH POLLARD NOAKES, v. COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.

Record No. 0295-08-2.

Court of Appeals of Virginia, Richmond.

January 13, 2009.

**\[ ... \]**

On October 18, 2006, Noah was placed in the care of appellant, who ran a
daycare business out of her home. Appellant placed Noah and at least one
other child in cribs located in a spare bedroom. A review of the
videotape recorded hours after Noah\'s death reveals his crib was more
analogous to a portable, \"pack and play\" variety than to a traditional
wooden crib. The surface of the Graco crib was raised from the floor by
four legs, which continued upward until they met hard plastic supports
at the top of each corner. The four \"walls\" of the crib were made of a
mesh material. The rectangular crib was placed in a corner of the
bedroom, at the intersection of the back wall and the right side wall;
therefore, one long side of the crib and one short side of the crib
abutted those walls. The other short side of Noah\'s crib was situated
within inches of another crib, leaving the remaining long side (\"the
front side\") as the only side of the crib exposed to the remainder of
the bedroom.

Appellant put Noah down for a nap at around noon, but Noah refused to
sleep. Noah\'s refusal to sleep was a common occurrence while he was in
appellant\'s care. Appellant had tried several \"traditional\" methods
to get Noah to sleep, but those were unsuccessful. Appellant determined
that the source of the problem was Noah\'s ability and desire to stand
in his crib.

In an attempt to prevent Noah from standing up, appellant devised a plan
to cover the top of the crib with cardboard and fabric and place a
thirty-three-pound, folded-up dog crate on top of the cardboard. The
cardboard and fabric would cover the entire top of the crib, and the dog
crate would cover half the width of the crib. Appellant would place the
dog crate so that it covered the front side of the crib, where Noah
usually stood.

Before leaving the dog crate there with Noah inside, appellant removed
Noah from the crib, placed the crate on the crib, and then shook the
crib to determine if the crate would easily fall down into the crib.
Satisfied that the dog crate would not fall in the crib, appellant
removed the crate momentarily and placed Noah back in his crib.
Appellant placed the cardboard and fabric on top of the crib in such a
way as to create an \"overhang\" to prevent Noah from sticking his
fingers between the crib and the cardboard, thereby potentially injuring
his fingers by getting them stuck in the dog crate. Appellant also
considered the cardboard covering (padded with the fabric) to be a
buffer should Noah hit his head while attempting to stand. Appellant
then placed the dog crate on the crib, inspected the arrangement with
Noah inside, and went back and forth periodically between her bedroom
and the adjoining loft bedroom to monitor the situation and see if Noah
was distressed.

Despite these efforts, Noah still refused to sleep. Instead, he began
pressing his face against the front side of the crib\'s mesh wall. To
stop this behavior, appellant placed a large nylon toy against the front
side\'s wall, so that Noah could not look out of the crib. Appellant
then assumed Noah went to asleep. She left the room at approximately
1:00 p.m.

Appellant did not return to the bedroom until approximately 3:30 p.m.,
when she attended to another child. She left without checking on Noah.

A few minutes after 4:00 p.m., appellant returned to wake Noah from his
nap. She saw Noah standing in the crib with his head, neck, and hands
over the side of the crib. His neck was wedged between the cardboard
covering and the wall of the front side of the crib. The dog crate,
still on top of the covering, held Noah in this position. As appellant
demonstrated in the videotape recorded following Noah\'s death, Noah
apparently lifted the cardboard covering enough to cause the dog crate
to slide backwards. Noah apparently then stuck his head over the
front-left corner and progressively slid along the front side\'s rail
until he was wedged under the thirty-three-pound dog crate near the
center of the front side. Noah became trapped as a result.

Noah was unconscious, and his face was blue. Appellant unsuccessfully
attempted CPR while she was on the phone with the emergency operator.
The responding paramedics pronounced Noah dead at appellant\'s home.

The medical examiner determined that Noah died from asphyxiation;
specifically, the suppression of the blood vessels in his neck had
constricted the flow of oxygen to his brain. The medical examiner could
not determine a time of death, but indicated that this type of
asphyxiation typically would have taken \"minutes and not hours.\"

At the conclusion of appellant\'s trial, the trial court found that the
Commonwealth had sufficiently proven appellant\'s criminal negligence,
commenting that appellant\'s \"conduct was arrogantly reckless,
merciless and inhumane, recklessly disregarding Noah\'s safety or
\[the\] consequences of her actions, being indifferent as to whether the
harm would result.\" The court found appellant guilty of involuntary
manslaughter, and this appeal followed.

## **\[ ... \]**

In a recent opinion, our Supreme Court explained the elements of
involuntary manslaughter accordingly:

> \[T\]he crime of common law involuntary manslaughter has two
> elements: 1) the accidental killing of a person, contrary to the
> intention of the parties; and 2) the death occurs in the defendant\'s
> prosecution of an unlawful but not felonious act, or in the
> defendant\'s improper performance of a lawful act. **\[ ... \]**To
> constitute involuntary manslaughter, the \"improper\" performance of a
> lawful act must amount to an unlawful commission of that lawful act,
> manifesting criminal negligence. **\[ ... \]**

To prove a defendant\'s criminal negligence in relation to an otherwise
lawful act, the Commonwealth must show that the performance was so
improper as to constitute negligence so gross and culpable as to
indicate a callous disregard of human life. **\[ ... \]**

appellant recognizes that there is support for a finding that she was
grossly negligent, insofar as her act of placing the dog crate on
Noah\'s crib \"constituted a disregard of prudence\" and would
\"shock\[\] the fair minded.\" **\[ ... \]**However, she contends that
she went to sufficient lengths to anticipate potential risks resulting
from her \"unconventional method\" and to prevent those risks from
becoming harmful. For instance, appellant noted that she shook the crate
(after initially placing it on the crib while it was empty), to test the
crate\'s tendency to fall from its perch over Noah; she padded the
bottom of the crate with cardboard and fabric to safeguard Noah against
injury to his head if he tried to stand; and she created an \"overhang\"
with the cardboard to safeguard against Noah injuring his fingers in the
holes of the crate. Appellant claims that such precautions demonstrate
that she did not act with a callous disregard for the risks of death or
serious injury that were likely to materialize. Therefore, appellant
argues, while she may have been grossly negligent in her care of Noah,
she was not criminally negligent.

We disagree with appellant\'s contention that her recognition of some
risks inherent in placing a thirty-three-pound dog crate on a crib
militates against a finding of criminal negligence. **\[ ... \]** Here,
the danger was that Noah would be harmed by appellant\'s placement of
the dog crate atop his crib. This danger came in numerous forms, and
appellant was aware of, or should have been aware of, far less dangerous
alternatives to putting a thirty-three-pound collapsed dog crate over a
young and active child in order to convince him to lie down and take a
nap.**\[ ... \]**Notably, appellant testified at trial that she
considered using only the cardboard or a net-like dome instead of the
dog crate, but rejected those options because they would not have
prevented Noah from standing up. So, appellant instead placed the dog
crate on Noah\'s crib, despite her recognition --- implicit in the
precautions that she took --- that this act could be dangerous. The
trial court could reasonably have concluded that appellant recklessly
disregarded Noah\'s safety by proceeding with her plan to prevent Noah
from standing up by placing the dog crate on his crib.

Appellant contends that, because Noah\'s death resulted from a different
risk of harm than she had foreseen, Noah\'s death was improbable;
therefore, she claims that she was not criminally liable for his death.
This contention is meritless. **\[ ... \]** Here, given that appellant
saw the need to protect this infant from some risks, appellant could
have foreseen the harm that could and did befall Noah from putting a
thirty-three-pound collapsed dog crate on top of his crib.

This is not a case where the defendant\'s *mere* inadvertence or
inattentiveness created harm or the potential for harm. **\[ ...
\]**Appellant affirmatively and knowingly created this danger to Noah,
and then, despite her initial concerns, failed to check on him for
several hours. Furthermore, the nature of Noah\'s death could not be
considered improbable, given appellant was aware that Noah was tall
enough to stand with his head above the crib
side.[^\[2\]^](#X8bc8642f1008174c07af08dad4478c5f807647a) **\[ ... \]**

In addition, appellant knew that Noah wanted to stand in the crib.
Consequently, she should have been especially concerned about how the
child would attempt to move the items over his crib when he attempted
--- as young children do --- to get around the constraints placed on
him. **\[ ... \]** It was not at all improbable that a determined child
of tender years would be able to get under the sides of this make-shift
contraption, move the dog crate, and, in the process, as here, get his
neck trapped so that he was asphyxiated. **\[ ... \]**

In summary, the act of attempting to limit Noah\'s ability to stand in
his crib was not inherently unlawful; rather, a reasonable factfinder
could determine that the placing of a thirty-three-pound dog crate on
Noah\'s crib, combined with appellant\'s inattentiveness in the face of
this experimental and dangerous set-up and with Noah\'s conceded
determination to stand up in his crib, constituted reckless and unlawful
conduct in utter disregard of Noah\'s safety. **\[ ... \]** Because
reasonable minds could make a determination here that appellant was
criminally negligent, **\[ ... \]**we conclude the trial court did not
err in finding her guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

## **\[ ... \]**

Clements, J., dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

In this case, appellant was admittedly negligent in placing the
cloth-covered cardboard and folded 33-pound dog crate over the child\'s
crib to prevent him from standing up during nap time. However, I find no
evidence in the record to support a finding that appellant\'s lawful act
was performed in a manner so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a
reckless disregard of human life.

For one thing, nothing in the record indicates that the act itself and
the manner in which it was performed were motivated by anything other
than appellant\'s concern for the child. **\[ ... \]** Concerned that
the child was not getting enough sleep, appellant tried various
\"traditional means\" to get the child to nap, but had no success. After
\"exhaust\[ing\] those means\" and \"brainstorming\" for several days to
come up with new ideas, appellant decided to cover the crib with
something \"heavy enough and large enough\" to prevent the child from
standing up. **\[ ... \]**

In placing the cardboard and dog crate over the crib, appellant took
every step she could think of to ensure they would not harm the child.
She initially tested them on the crib without the child in it to satisfy
herself that they would not fall into the crib, even shaking the crib to
make sure the covering was stable. She made sure the cardboard covered
the entire top of the crib so the child could not hurt his head or
fingers on the dog crate. She made sure the crate extended far enough
over both sides of the crate so that \"there would be no way that the
crate could fall in given the overhang.\" She positioned the cardboard
so that it extended beyond the crib where the child normally stood up
and was folded over one side of the crib next to the wall to stabilize
it. Additionally, when she placed the crate on the crib, appellant made
sure it was positioned over the spot where the child normally stood by
the front railing to prevent the child from being able to lift the
cardboard at that spot. After putting the child in the covered crib
shortly after 12:00 p.m., appellant stayed for a while in the child\'s
room, which was a loft off her bedroom, to monitor the child and make
sure he was not in any distress beneath the cardboard and crate. The
child, who was playing with a ball in his crib, did not cry or try to
stand up during that time. Around 1:00 p.m., appellant returned to the
child\'s room and covered the front of the crib with a toy to help him
go to sleep. The child was not standing at the time.

Several times throughout the afternoon, appellant returned to her
bedroom to audibly monitor the child. Hearing no noise from the child,
appellant assumed he was asleep. Around 3:30 p.m., appellant returned to
the child\'s room for an unrelated purpose. Not seeing the child and
assuming he was still
asleep,[^\[4\]^](#X18f8a2921b290406a5fe407174ffd5907cb15e9) appellant
went back downstairs. Approximately a half an hour later, appellant
returned to the room to wake the child and discovered him standing in
the crib with his neck wedged in between the cardboard and the front
railing of the crib. Appellant immediately removed the child from the
crib, called 911, and tried to revive him.

Throughout these events, appellant expressed a genuine concern only for
the child\'s well being. No evidence suggests her actions were born of
frustration, inconvenience, or any other selfish motivation.

Likewise, nothing in the record indicates that appellant was aware or
reasonably should have been aware that her conduct would *probably*
cause injury to the child. Not only did she take steps to prevent every
possible danger that reasonably occurred to her, the Commonwealth
presented no evidence to show she knew or reasonably should have known
that the fifteen-month-old child possessed sufficient strength and
ability to lift the cardboard under the 33-pound dog crate to the side
so that he could stand up with his head between the cardboard and the
front of the crib. To the contrary, the record shows that appellant
specifically used the dog crate because she believed it was \"heavy
enough and large enough\" to prevent the child from moving it and the
cardboard beneath it. Indeed, appellant was initially unsure that *she*
would even \"be\[\] able to lift the crate.\" Nothing in the record
demonstrates that appellant\'s belief that the weight of the crate would
make it physically impossible for the child to lift the cardboard at the
front of the crib was unreasonable.

Accordingly, I find the evidence insufficient to prove that appellant\'s
improper performance of the lawful act amounted to criminal negligence.
Thus, I would reverse appellant\'s conviction for involuntary
manslaughter and dismiss the charge.

[**\[ ... \]**](#X7c5724d8e8b3d422f85bbeb078d3df9b6a03bab)

[\[2\]](#Xd881b9a2f380c05461ec77b80b4638d23e5dd15) We reject
appellant\'s related argument that Noah\'s ability to lift a dog crate
thirty percent heavier than his own weight was an improbable feat
constituting an intervening cause for his death, thus rendering
appellant\'s placement of the dog crate on top of his crib something
other than the probable cause of his death. However, Noah\'s lifting the
dog crate, if this is how he became wedged between the crate and the
crib, \"was put into operation by \[appellant\'s\] negligent act\[\]\"
of placing the dog crate on top of Noah\'s crib. See O\'Connell v.
Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 719, 728, 634 S.E.2d 379, 383 (2006).
Therefore, Noah\'s actions were not an intervening cause.

[\[4\]](#X09c8f2d468a144107660c92f769124a7b4df225) Although, as the
Commonwealth points out, appellant told the police she did not directly
look at or check on the child during that trip to the child\'s room, it
is clear from the record that, had the child been standing in the crib,
appellant would have seen him.

Felony Murder

 

In criminal law, sometimes the result trumps the intention. Perhaps the
least intuitive category of homicide that we will study is felony
murder. Under the felony murder rule, accidental and unintentional
killings that occur during the commission of a felony are sometimes
elevated from unintentional homicide to murder. The felony murder rule
has been controversial. It has evolved in scope over time, and, as the
cases below show, is now often limited to inherently dangerous felonies.
By transferring intention and blameworthiness from a separate felony to
a homicide, the felony murder rule significantly raises the stakes of
any felony that may tangentially and even unforeseeably lead to death.
Why might the felony murder doctrine have developed? Consider how courts
have limited it over time. What concerns have animated criticisms of the
rule? Have the courts' efforts to limit the rule preserved its
usefulness, or is it an unfortunate relic of the past?

Teaching Memo on Felony Murder

 

By Angela Madrigal, Cydney Chilimidos, and Zachary Nemirovsky

**[Removing *People v. Smith* for *People v. Chun*]{.underline}**

*People v. Smith* is a 1984 case from the Supreme Court of California,
included in the unit on felony murder to teach the "Merger" doctrine, a
limitation to the felony murder rule. We chose to replace this case for
two reasons: (1) that the fact pattern unnecessarily deals with child
abuse, especially considering the already significant amount of child
abuse covered in the casebook, and (2) that the merger law in the case
is outdated and not very clearly stated, considering in particular the
developments of 2009 in *People v. Chun*. This desire to change the case
is also spurred by the excellent discussion and examples of merger in
*Chun*, which provides a much better look at the doctrine than does
*Smith*. A brief explanation of the problems in *Smith* follows.

Firstly, felony murder must always have an underlying felony, which
means that some level of violence is likely in the underlying fact
pattern. However, the underlying felony in *Smith* is felony child abuse
which, along with its accompanying facts, is unnecessary at this point
in the casebook. After doing research into other options, we found that
there are cases discussing merger including: assault with a deadly
weapon (*People v. Ireland* (1969)); administering poison or drugs
(*People v. Mattison* (1971) and *People v. Taylor* (1970)); shooting at
an inhabited dwelling (*People v. Hansen* (1994)); discharging a firearm
in a grossly negligent manner (*People v. Robertson* (2004) and *People
v. Randle* (2005)); and shooting at an occupied vehicle (*People v.
Chun* (2009)). As far as the facts, any and all of these are easier to
read than the child abuse of *People v. Smith*.

            Secondly, the doctrine of merger as given in *Smith* is
outdated. The simple truth is that the doctrine has been extremely
tricky to pin down, and the Supreme Court of California (in almost all
of those cases above) has in some way revised the doctrine. In that
sense, any of them provides as good a discussion of merger as does
*Smith*, and only those before *Hansen* are as outdated. It should be
noted, of course, that several of those cases have been overruled while
*Smith* has not been, but almost all of them have been disapproved of
(which *Smith* has been, for its reasoning though not its result). As
such, no particular preference for *Smith* should arise on this front.

            This leaves the question of which case to choose to replace
*Smith*. *Ireland* has the advantage of being the first and seminal case
for the merger doctrine, but also has the disadvantage of being the
oldest and most outdated. *Mattison* and *Taylor* use reasoning that has
been expressly rejected (actually, rejected, re-adopted, and
re-rejected). *People v. Hansen* uses reasoning that has been rejected,
and in addition has been overruled. And *Robertson* and *Randle* use
reasoning that has been rejected, and have both been overruled. This
makes apparent the question: what case exactly has been doing all of
this overruling? The answer is *People v. Chun*.

            *People v. Chun* is an excellent case. Already quoted by
Dressler in note 1 following *Smith*, it excels for several reasons.
First, the facts of the case are (in the context of murder) easy to
read, and additionally provide an interesting opportunity for comment on
"model minorities."[^\[1\]^](#X0b44d7b2abab9f34350d6c7a4f630f0a3b8ed55)
Second, the Court in *Chun* engages (because of a challenge by the
defendant) in an analysis of the constitutionality / validity of
second-degree felony murder as a whole, which fits nicely with *People
v. Fuller* and *People v. Howard*, read by the students earlier in the
assignment. Third, *Chun* acknowledges the muddled nature of the merger
doctrine, and engages in an excellent historical review touching on many
(in its unedited format, all) of the prior cases mentioned, and the
various reasoning used by the Court in those cases. Finally, the Court
in *Chun* lays out the clear "assaultive" standard that is already
quoted by Dressler in note 1 as the current governing rule in
California.

            In addition, *Chun* also contains two concurring and
dissenting opinions. The second, by Justice Moreno, is particularly of
interest and has been edited down but included in the case for students.
In Justice Moreno's concurring and dissenting opinion, he agrees with
the conclusion the felony-murder should not apply in this case, but not
because of the merger doctrine. Rather, JusticeMoreno would eliminate
second-degree felony murder entirely, finding it unnecessary in most
cases. This opinion in particular fits well with the discussion on
felony murder in the casebook.

            The only problem with *Chun* in its original form is its
length. If an instructor wanted to touch on all of the felony murder
issues raised in this case, it could easily take half of a class or an
entire class period. That in mind, the case has been significantly cut
down. The facts are nearly all present, being a rather short portion.
The constitutionality / validity discussion is present in a shortened
form for students. The bulk of the case that remains is the analysis of
the merger doctrine itself. Finally, the entire section discussing
prejudice as a procedural matter has been eliminated.

As for the notes that follow *Smith*, most of them carry over just as
well to follow *Chun*. Those notes are also included in the separately
attached text of *People v. Chun*.

[^\[1\]^](#X3a1fb13d264c4b3d32bfbbf852689c376ae5159) The case is about a
drive-by shooting perpetuated by two rival gangs. It is not, however,
African American or Hispanic gangs as are at issue in so many cases in
the public discourse. The gangs are the "Asian Boys" and the "Tiny

Overview

 

**Felony Murder Rule**

            Simply stated, the felony murder rule is designed to impose
stringent responsibility and harsh sentencing on individuals who, in the
course of committing a felony, contribute to someone else's death. Even
more simply put, a felony + a killing = felony murder.

**            American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries,
Comment to § 210.2**

(1980), 30--32.

The classic formulation of the felony-murder doctrine declares that one
is guilty of murder if a death results from conduct during the
commission or attempted commission of any felony. Some courts have made
no effort to qualify the application of this doctrine, and a number of
earlier English writers also articulated an unqualified rule. At the
time the Model Code was drafted, a number of American legislatures,
moreover, perpetuated the original statement of the rule by statute. As
thus conceived, the rule operated to impose liability for murder based
on the culpability required for the underlying felony without separate
proof of any culpability with regard to the death. The homicide, as
distinct from the underlying felony, was thus an offense of strict
liability. This rule may have made sense under the conception of *mens
rea* as something approaching a general criminal disposition rather than
as a specific attitude of the defendant towards each element of a
specific offense. Furthermore, it was hard to claim that the doctrine
worked injustice in an age that recognized only a few felonies and that
punished each as a capital offense.

In modern times, however, legislatures have created a wide range of
statutory felonies. Many of these crimes concern relatively minor
misconduct not inherently dangerous to life and carry maximum penalties
far less severe than those authorized for murder. Application of the
ancient rigor of the felony-murder rule to such crimes will yield
startling results. For example, a seller of liquor in violation of a
statutory felony becomes a murderer if his purchaser falls asleep on the
way home and dies of exposure. And a person who communicates disease
during felonious sexual intercourse is guilty of murder if his partner
subsequently dies of the infection.

The prospect of such consequences has led to a demand for limitations on
the felony-murder rule.

People v. Fuller

 

Court of Appeal of the State of California

86 Cal. App. 3d 618

Crim. No. 3317

1978-11-21

FRANSON, Acting P. J.

Introduction

This appeal challenges the California felony-murder rule as it applies
to an unintentionally caused death during a high speed automobile chase
following the commission of a nonviolent, daylight burglary of an
unattended motor vehicle. Solely by force of precedent we hold that the
felony-murder rule applies and respondents can be prosecuted for first
degree murder.

Statement of the Case and Facts

Respondents were charged by information with murder (Pen. Code, § 187)
and several counts of burglary. **\[ ... \]**

The pertinent facts are as follows: On Sunday, February 20, 1977, at
about 8:30 a.m., uniformed Cadet Police Officer Guy Ballesteroz was on
routine patrol in his vehicle**\[ ... \]**. As the officer approached
the Fresno Dodge car lot, he saw an older model Plymouth parked in front
of the lot. He also saw respondents rolling two tires apiece toward the
Plymouth. His suspicions aroused, the officer radioed the dispatcher and
requested that a police unit be sent.

**\[ ... \]**Ballesteroz made a U-turn and headed northbound on
Blackstone. The respondents got into the Plymouth and drove away "really
fast." Thereafter, a high speed chase ensued which eventually resulted
in respondents' car running a red light **\[ ... \]** and striking
another automobile which had entered the intersection. The driver of the
other automobile was killed. Respondents were arrested at the scene. The
chase from the car lot covered some 7 miles and lasted approximately 10
to 12 minutes. **\[ ... \]**

Later investigation revealed that four locked Dodge vans at the car lot
had been forcibly entered and the spare tires removed. Fingerprints from
both of the respondents were found on the jack stands in some of the
vans.

Respondents May Be Prosecuted for First Degree Felony Murder

Penal Code section 189 provides, in pertinent part: "All murder . . .
which is committed *in the perpetration of,* or attempt to perpetrate,
arson, rape, robbeiy, *burglary,* mayhem, or \[lewd acts with a minor\],
is murder of the first degree; . . ." (Italics added.) This statute
imposes strict liability for deaths committed in the course of one of
the enumérated felonies whether the killing was caused intentionally,
negligently, or merely accidentally. **\[ ... \]**

Burglary falls expressly within the purview of California's first degree
felony-murder rule. Any burglaiy within Penal Code section 459 is
sufficient to invoke the rule. **\[ ... \]**

The meaning of murder committed "in the perpetration of' a felony within
Penal Code section 189 also is clear. The Supreme Court has stated that
this language does not require a strict causal relation between the
felony and the killing; it is sufficient if both are "parts of one
continuous transaction." *(People* v. *Welch* (1972) 8 Cal.3d 106, 118
\[104 Cal.Rptr. 217, 501 P.2d 225\]; *People* v. *Mason* (1960) 54
Cal.2d 164, 169 \[4 Cal.Rptr. 841, 351 P.2d 1025\].) Flight following a
felony is considered part of the same transaction as long as the felon
has not reached a "place of temporary safety." **\[ ... \]**

. The escape of the robbers with the loot, by means of arms, necessarily
is as important to the execution to the plan as gaining possession of
the property." *(Id.,* at p. 251.)

**\[ ... \]**Thus, the trial court erred in striking the murder count
premised upon the felony-murder rule.

We deem it appropriate, however, to make a few observations concerning
the irrationality of applying the felony-murder rule in the present
case. **\[ ... \]**

If we were writing on a clean slate, we would hold that respondents
should not be prosecuted for felony murder since **\[ ... \]**an
automobile burglary is not dangerous to human life. The present case
demonstrates why this is so. Respondents committed the burglary on vans
parked in a dealer's lot on a Sunday morning. There were no people
inside the vans or on the lot at the time. The respondents were not
armed and presumably had no expectation of using violence during the
burglary.

*\[Under the present rule,\]* if a merchant in pursuit of a fleeing
shoplifter is killed accidentally (by falling and striking his head on
the curb or being hit by a passing automobile), the thief would be
guilty of first degree felony murder assuming the requisite intent to
steal at the time of the entry into the store. **\[ ... \]** Such a
harsh result destroys the symmetry of the law by equating an accidental
killing resulting from a petty theft with a premeditated murder. In no
sense can it be said that such a result furthers the ostensible purpose
of the felony-murder rule which is to deter those engaged in felonies
from killing negligently or accidentally. **\[ ... \]**

"inhabited" means currently being used for dwelling purposes, whether
occupied or not. A house, trailer, vessel designed for habitation, or

The Felony-Murder Rule: A Doctrine at Constitutional Crossroads

 

 

**Nelson E. Roth & Scott E. Sundby---The Felony-Murder Rule: A Doctrine
at Constitutional Crossroads**

[70 Cornell Law Review 446 (1985), 446--55,
457--59](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=Y&db=0001111&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&serialnum=0105120936&fn=_top&findtype=Y&vr=2.0&wbtoolsId=0105120936&HistoryType=F).

Few legal doctrines have been as maligned and yet have shown as great a
resiliency as the felony-murder rule. Criticism of the rule constitutes
a lexicon of everything that scholars and jurists can find wrong with a
legal doctrine: it has been described as "astonishing" and "monstrous,"
an unsupportable "legal fiction," "an unsightly wart on the skin of the
criminal law," and as an "anachronistic remnant" that has " 'no logical
or practical basis for existence in modern law.' " Perhaps the most that
can be said for the rule is that it provides commentators with an
extreme example that makes it easy to illustrate the injustice of
various legal propositions.

Despite the widespread criticism, the felony-murder rule persists in the
vast majority of states. Most states have attempted to limit the rule's
potential harshness either by limiting the scope of its operation or by
providing affirmative defenses. Such patchwork attempts to mitigate the
rule's harshness, however, have been legitimately criticized because
"they do not resolve \[the rule's\] essential illogic." \* \* \* The
United States thus remains virtually the only western country still
recognizing a rule which makes it possible "that the most serious
sanctions known to law might be imposed for accidental homicide." \* \*
\*

I

The Conceptual Basis of the Felony-Murder Rule

*A.The Rule's Historical Development \* \* \**

The purpose of the felony-murder rule at common law is \* \* \* vague.
It is frequently argued that the rule's purpose was not fully
articulated because all felonies at common law were punished by death
and, therefore, the rule had little practical impact. \* \* \*

Whatever the felony-murder rule's justification at common law, courts
have attempted to provide the rule with a contemporary rationale. These
post hoc rationalizations fall into four general categories: deterrence,
transferred intent, retribution, and general culpability.

*B.Deterrence*

The deterrence rationale consists of two different strains. The first
approach views the felony-murder rule as a doctrine intended to deter
negligent and accidental killings during commission of felonies.
Proponents argue that co-felons will dissuade each other from the use of
violence if they may be liable for murder. Justice Holmes attempted to
justify the rule on this basis by arguing that the rule would be
justified if experience showed that death resulted disproportionately
from the commission of felonies. Holmes added the caveat that "I do not
\* \* \*, however, mean to argue that the rules under discussion arose
on the above reasoning, any more than that they are right, or would be
generally applied in this country."

The second view focuses not on the killing, but on the felony itself,
and endorses the felony-murder rule as a deterrent to dangerous
felonies. From this perspective, punishing both accidental and
deliberate killings that result from the commission of a felony is "the
strongest possible deterrent" to "undertaking inherently dangerous
felonies."

Both of the deterrence justifications are logically flawed and neither
has proven to have a basis in fact. The illogic of the felony-murder
rule as a means of deterring killing is apparent when applied to
accidental killings occurring during the commission of a felony. Quite
simply, how does one deter an unintended act? \* \* \* Moreover, any
potential deterrence effect on unintentional killings is further reduced
because few felons either will know that the felony-murder rule imposes
strict liability for resulting deaths or will believe that harm will
result from commission of the felony. Finally, statistical evidence has
not borne out Holmes's proposed justification that a disproportionate
number of killings occur during
felonies.[^34^](https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781642427400/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.84)

The purpose of deterring the commission of dangerous felonies through
the felony-murder rule also lacks a legitimate basis. First,
considerable doubt exists that serious crimes are deterred by varying
the weight of the punishment. Second, the rule from this perspective
uses the sanctions for murder to deter felonies, and "it is usually
accepted as wiser to strike at the harm intended by the criminal rather
than at the greater harm possibly flowing from his act which was neither
intended nor desired by him." Where the killing is unintended, it would
be far more sensible to enhance the sentence for conduct over which the
felon had control, such as the carrying of a deadly weapon, rather than
automatically to elevate the killing to murder. Finally, as with the
other deterrence rationale, the felony-murder rule can have no deterrent
effect if the felon either does not know how the rule works or does not
believe a killing will actually result. \* \* \*

*C.Transferred Intent and Constructive Malice: The*

*Felony-Murder Rule's Presumption of Culpability*

The felony-murder rule may be conceptualized as a theory of "transferred
or constructive intent." This theory posits that the intent to commit
the felony is "transferred" to the act of killing in order to find
culpability for the homicide. The rule thus serves "the purpose of \* \*
\* reliev\[ing\] the state of the burden of proving premeditation or
malice."

Judges and commentators have criticized the transferred intent theory of
felony murder as "an anachronistic remnant" that operates "fictitiously"
to broaden unacceptably the scope of murder. The very concept of
transferred intent has been criticized as having "no proper place in
criminal law." \* \* \*

The inapplicability of transferred intent to felony murder becomes
evident when the crime's two different mens rea elements are examined:
the intent to commit the felony and the culpability for the killing. The
mental patterns are thus distinct and separate; for example, the intent
to burglarize cannot be equated with the malice aforethought required
for murder. The non-transferability of culpability is even more evident
where the felony-murder rule allows elevation of the killing to first
degree murder. In such a situation, the rule equates the intent to
commit the felony with premeditation and deliberation, specific mental
states that require proof of particular acts and thoughts. \* \* \*

*D.Retribution and General Culpability: A Strict*

*Liability View of the Felony-Murder Rule*

\* \* \* An alternative approach is to view the rule as not requiring a
separate mens rea element for the homicide, but as justifying conviction
for murder simply on the basis that the defendant committed a felony and
a killing occurred.

\* \* \* The justifications advanced for this conceptualization are
deterrence of the underlying felony, and the notion that the felon has
exhibited an "evil mind" justifying severe punishment.

The "evil mind" theory of felony murder finds its roots in seventeenth
and eighteenth century English notions of criminology. Mens rea was a
less developed concept and judges focused on the harm resulting from a
defendant's illegal act, rather than the maliciousness of his intent.
The felony-murder rule thus partly operated on an unarticulated
rationale that one who does bad acts cannot complain about being
punished for their consequences, no matter how unexpected. Moreover, the
felony-murder rule conceived from an "evil mind" perspective comported
with the retribution theory of punishment prevailing at the time of the
rule's development, which focused on the resulting harm, not on the
actor's mental state, in deciding the appropriate punishment. A convict,
therefore, bore responsibility for his felony and for any harmful result
arising from the crime regardless of his specific intentions.

Continued reliance on a general culpability theory to justify the
felony-murder rule has been described as a rather "primitive rationale"
and as "a tribute to the tenacity of legal conceptions rooted in simple
moral attitudes." The "evil mind" theory conflicts with the basic
premise that "the criminal law is concerned not only with guilt or
innocence in the abstract but also with the degree of criminal
liability." Although the general culpability rationale was perhaps
sufficient as long as a general intent of wrongdoing established malice
aforethought, it conflicts with the progressive trend of categorizing
homicide according to the degree of culpability. Indeed, the
felony-murder rule viewed from a general culpability perspective
effectively eliminates a mens rea element in convicting a felon for a
killing occurring during the commission of a felony, and results in the
rule operating as a strict liability crime: the occurrence of a killing
is punished as murder regardless of the defendant's culpability.

In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine

Doctrine**

374--76.

I.The Policies Supporting the Felony Murder Rule

*A.Rational Classification and Proportional Grading*

*of Offenses: Actus Reus as an Element of Just Desert*

Classical theory divides the elements of crimes into two categories:
mens rea and actus reus. Mens rea, or "guilty mind," is the mental state
or states required to complete the offense. Actus reus may be translated
literally as "the wrongful act," but it is better understood as
referring to all of the physical elements of the crime, including the
defendant's actions, the surrounding circumstances, and the
consequences.

Differences in result must be taken into account as part of actus reus
if classification and grading are to be rational. For example, murder
and attempted murder may require similar mental states \* \* \* but no
common law jurisdiction treats the two offenses as one, and certainly
none treats attempted murder more severely. The only difference
justifying this classification is that death results in one offense but
not in the other. Similarly, it is a misdemeanor for a person to operate
a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, but if this conduct
causes the death of a human being, the offense in some jurisdictions is
elevated to the status of homicide. \* \* \*

These classifications are the result of a concern for grading offenses
so as to reflect societal notions of proportionality. \* \* \*

The felony murder doctrine serves this goal, just as do the distinctions
inherent in the separate offenses of attempted murder and murder, or
impaired driving and vehicular homicide. Felony murder reflects a
societal judgment that an intentionally committed robbery that causes
the death of a human being is qualitatively more serious than an
identical robbery that does not. Perhaps this judgment could have been
embodied in a newly defined offense called "robbery-resulting-in-death";
but \* \* \* such a proliferation of offense definitions is undesirable.
Thus the felony murder doctrine reflects the conclusion that a robbery
that causes death is more closely akin to murder than to robbery. If
this conclusion accurately reflects societal attitudes, and if
classification of crimes is to be influenced by such attitudes in order
to avoid depreciation of the seriousness of the offense and to encourage
respect for the law, then the felony murder doctrine is an appropriate
classificatory device.

There is impressive empirical evidence that this classification does
indeed reflect widely shared societal attitudes. \* \* \*

*B.Condemnation: Reaffirming the Sanctity of Human Life*

A purpose of sentencing closely related to proportionality is that of
condemnation. \* \* \* \[T\]he purpose of condemnation or of expressing
societal outrage deserves separate mention as a policy concern
underlying the felony murder rule.

Condemnation itself is a multifaceted idea. It embodies the notion of
reinforcement of societal norms and values as a guide to the conduct of
upright persons, as opposed to less upright ones who presumably require
the separate prod of "deterrence." The felony murder rule serves this
purpose by distinguishing crimes that cause human deaths, thus
reinforcing the reverence for human life. To put the argument
differently, characterizing a robbery-homicide solely as robbery would
have the undesirable effect of communicating to the citizenry that the
law does not consider a crime that takes a human life to be different
from one that does not---a message that would be indistinguishable, in
the minds of many, from a devaluation of human life.

Another aspect of condemnation is the expression of solidarity with the
victims of crime. If we as a society label a violent offense in a manner
that depreciates its significance, we communicate to the victim by
implication that we do not understand his suffering. \* \* \* Felony
murder is a useful doctrine because it reaffirms to the surviving family
of a felony-homicide victim the kinship the society as a whole feels
with him by denouncing in the strongest language of the law the
intentional crime that produced the death.

Yet another facet of condemnation is expiation. A sound penal system
attempts to provide the convicted defendant with a means by which he can
"repay his debt to society" and thereby anticipate at least qualified
readmittance---not only in the calculating eyes of the law as it
measures his service of sentence, but in the hearts of fellow citizens,
at least for crimes for which such repayment is possible. The felony
murder rule may serve this purpose. \* \* \*

*C.Deterrence*

Deterrence is often cited as one justification for the felony murder
doctrine. \* \* \* Deterrence is the policy most often recognized in the
cases.

Scholars, however, tend to dismiss this rationale, using such arguments
as the improbability that felons will know the law, the unlikelihood
that a criminal who has formed the intent to commit a felony will
refrain from acts likely to cause death, or the assertedly small number
of felony-homicides.

The trouble with these criticisms is that they underestimate the
complexity of deterrence. There may be more than a grain of truth in the
proposition that felons, if considered as a class, evaluate risks and
benefits differently than members of other classes in society. The
conclusion does not follow, however, that felons cannot be deterred, or
that criminals are so different from other citizens that they are
impervious to inducements or deterrents that would affect people in
general. There is mounting evidence that serious crime is subject to
deterrence if consequences are adequately communicated. The felony
murder rule is just the sort of simple, commonsense, readily
enforceable, and widely known principle that is likely to result in
deterrence.

At the same time, the argument that felons may be ignorant of the law is
unduly categorical. If it is meant to state that felons probably cannot
quote the statutory language or cite the section number governing their
actions contemporaneously with the event, the proposition is probably
correct. Nevertheless, the general population, including felons, is
probably more aware of the outlines of the felony murder doctrine than
of many other, more common criminal concepts, if only because of the
influence of television. \* \* \*

The argument against deterrence often proceeds on the additional
assumption that felony murder is addressed only to accidental killings
and cannot result in their deterrence. \* \* \* The proposition that
accidental killings cannot be deterred is inconsistent with the
widespread belief that the penalizing of negligence, and even the
imposition of strict liability, may have deterrent consequences.

*D. Clear and Unambiguous Definition of*

*Offenses and Sentence Consequences*

Clear definition of crimes is advantageous. Imprecision in homicide
definition is particularly prevalent and troublesome. Jury instructions
on the presence or absence of premeditation, on conditions required for
reduction to voluntary manslaughter, on the double misnomer embodied in
"malice aforethought," and on the fine gradations between intent,
knowledge, recklessness, and criminal negligence are typical sources of
confusion. These concepts may be valuable because they relate to just
desert and thus to proportionality, but the definitions of these terms,
when given to lay jurors, may produce verdicts that differ more on
account of jurors' understanding of words than on account of evidence of
the crime. Hence unpredictable dispositions are a likely result.

If properly defined and applied, the felony murder doctrine sometimes
provides the advantage of greater clarity. The mental state of intention
to commit robbery, rape, or kidnapping is less ambiguous than the terms
generally governing homicidal mental states. \* \* \*

*E. Optimal Allocation of Criminal Justice Resources*

Another advantage of the felony murder rule \* \* \* is that it may aid
in the optimal allocation of criminal justice resources. \* \* \* The
efforts of judges, courtroom time, lawyering on both sides, and support
services are all scarce resources. Although we resist thinking of
criminal justice in these terms, and few would be willing to put a
specific dollar price upon its proper function, the quality of our
justice is limited by the scarcity of these resources and by the
efficiency with which we allocate them. \* \* \*

\* \* \* The rule has beneficial allocative consequences because it
clearly defines the offense, simplifies the task of the judge and jury
with respect to questions of law and fact, and thereby promotes
efficient administration of justice. Indeed, no less a tribunal than the
California Supreme Court has stated this rationale:

The Legislature has said in effect that this deterrent purpose \[of the
felony murder rule\] outweighs the normal legislative policy of
examining the individual state of mind of each person causing an
unlawful killing to determine whether the killing was with or without
malice, deliberate or accidental, and calibrating our treatment of the
person accordingly. Once a person perpetrates or attempts to perpetrate
one of the enumerated felonies, then in the judgment of the Legislature,
he is no longer entitled to such fine judicial calibration, but will be
deemed guilty of first degree murder for any homicide committed in the
course thereof. \* \* \*

*F. Minimization of the Utility of Perjury*

Many crimes are defined more broadly than their harmful consequences
alone might justify. For example, there are prohibitions upon the
possession of heroin or the carrying of certain kinds of weapons, even
though these actions, without use of the contraband, are not
intrinsically harmful. A person might attempt to defend his possession
of heroin by stating that he did not intend to use or distribute it (for
example, he might explain that he collects controlled substances as
others collect coins or stamps). This explanation, even if true, would
be regarded as irrelevant under most statutes.

Such a result may be justified by the concern that any other approach
would unduly reward perjury. The denial of harmful intent in such a
situation is too facile. Sources of contrary evidence persuasive beyond
reasonable doubt are likely to be absent even if the defensive theory is
perjurious. If lack of intent to use an illegally possessed machine gun
vitiated the possessory offense, the crime would be far more difficult
to prosecute, and the ultimate harm that is the real concern would
become that much more difficult to control. A similar rationale may
underlie the felony murder rule; thus \* \* \* the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court justified its application of the felony murder rule to the
circumstances before it with the observation, "It is rare \* \* \* that
a criminal telephones or telegraphs his criminal intent \* \* \*."

Scholars criticizing the felony murder rule sometimes argue or assume
that juries will disbelieve false claims of accident. The criticism
assumes too much: The accident claim need only rise to the level of
reasonable doubt to be effective under conventional homicide law.
Experienced trial lawyers would not deny the frequent occurrence of
erroneous acquittals, given the standard of proof required. Moreover,
the incentive to perjury is itself a liability. The law itself is
brought into disrepute when it is defined so that perjury is frequent.
Jurors might be induced to lose respect for the criminal justice system
even as they acquit the defendant on his ambiguous claim of accident,
which they disbelieve but cannot reject beyond a reasonable doubt.

KENNARD, J.

Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, with malice
aforethought. (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a).) But under the second degree
felony-murder rule, the prosecution can obtain a conviction without
showing malice if the killing occurred during the commission of an
inherently dangerous felony. Is the crime of driving with a willful or
wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property while fleeing
from a pursuing police officer (Veh. Code, § 2800.2)[^44] an inherently
dangerous felony for purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule?
We conclude it is not.

I

At 12:40 a.m. on May 23, 2002, California Highway Patrol Officer Gary
Stephany saw defendant driving a Chevrolet Tahoe (a sport utility
vehicle) without a rear license plate, and signaled him to pull over.
Defendant stopped on the side of the road. But when Officer Stephany and
his partner, **\[ ... \]** got out of their patrol car, defendant
restarted the engine and sped to a nearby freeway. The officers gave
chase at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour and radioed for assistance.
Defendant left the freeway and drove onto a surface street, turning off
his car's headlights. He ran two stop signs and a red light, and he
drove on the wrong side of the road. His speed was 15 to 20 miles over
the posted speed limit of 50 miles per hour. At some point, he made a
sharp turn onto a small dirt road and escaped.

Minutes later, Officer Anthony Arcelus and his partner**\[ ... \]**saw
the Tahoe with its headlights on again and took up the chase. Officer
Arcelus**\[ ... \]**estimated the Tahoe's speed at more than 80 miles
per hour, and he saw it run a stop sign and a traffic light. By then,
the car's headlights were again turned off. Up to that point, the chase
had taken place in rural parts of Fresno County. When the Tahoe started
heading toward downtown Fresno, Officer Arcelus gave up the pursuit,
fearing that the high-speed chase might cause an accident.

About a minute after Officer Arcelus stopped chasing the Tahoe, he saw
it run a red light half a mile ahead of him and collide with a car
driven by Jeanette Rodriguez. Rodriguez was killed**\[ ... \]**It turned
out that the Tahoe that defendant was driving had been stolen earlier
that day. Defendant**\[ ... \]**was arrested and charged with murder
**\[ ... \]**and with evading a police officer in willful or wanton
disregard for the safety of persons or property (§ 2800.2).

**\[ ... \]**

The jury convicted defendant of all counts.

The Court of Appeal affirmed. As pertinent here, it rejected defendant's
contention that he could not be convicted under the second degree
felony-murder rule because section 2800.2 is not an inherently dangerous
felony. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Because the second degree felony-murder rule is a court-made rule, it
has no statutory definition. This court has described it thusly: "A
homicide that is a direct causal result of the commission of a felony
*inherently dangerous to human life* (other than the . . . felonies
enumerated in Pen. Code, § 189) constitutes at least second degree
murder." **\[ ... \]**The rule "eliminates the need for proof of malice
in connection with a charge of murder." **\[ ... \]** It is **\[ ...
\]** a substantive rule of law **\[ ... \]** based on the theory that
"when society has declared certain inherently dangerous conduct to be
felonious, a defendant should not be allowed to excuse himself by saying
he was unaware of the danger to life because, by declaring the conduct
to be felonious, society has warned him of the risk involved." **\[ ...
\]**

Because the second degree felony-murder rule is "a judge-made doctrine
without any express basis in the Penal Code" **\[ ... \]**, its
constitutionality has been questioned **\[ ... \]**. And, as we have
noted in the past, legal scholars have criticized the rule for
incorporating "an artificial concept of strict criminal liability that
'erodes the relationship between criminal liability and moral
culpability.' " **\[ ... \]** Therefore, we have repeatedly stressed
that the rule " 'deserves no extension beyond its required application.'
" **\[ ... \]**

"In determining whether a felony is inherently dangerous \[under the
second degree felony-murder rule\], the court looks to the elements of
the felony *in the abstract,* 'not the "particular" facts of the case,'
i.e., not to the defendant's specific conduct." **\[ ... \]** That is,
we determine whether the felony "by its very nature . . . cannot be
committed without creating a substantial risk that someone will be
killed . . . ." **\[ ... \]**

Felonies that have been held inherently dangerous to life include
shooting at an inhabited dwelling**\[ ... \]**, poisoning with intent to
injure **\[ ... \]**, arson of a motor vehicle **\[ ... \]**, grossly
negligent discharge of a firearm **\[ ... \]**, manufacturing
methamphetamine **\[ ... \]**, kidnapping **\[ ... \]**, and reckless or
malicious possession of a destructive device**\[ ... \]**.

Felonies that have been held *not* inherently dangerous to life include
**\[ ... \]** false imprisonment by violence, menace, fraud, or deceit
**\[ ... \]**; possession of a concealable firearm by a convicted felon
**\[ ... \]**; possession of a sawed-off shotgun **\[ ... \]**; escape
**\[ ... \]**; grand theft **\[ ... \]**; conspiracy to possess
methedrine **\[ ... \]**; extortion **\[ ... \]** and child endangerment
or abuse**\[ ... \]**.

m

In determining whether section 2800.2 is an offense inherently dangerous
to life, we begin by reviewing the statutory scheme. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Section 2800.2, which was the basis for defendant's conviction under the
second degree felony-murder rule, provides:

> "(a) If a person flees or attempts to elude a pursuing peace officer
> in violation of Section 2800.1 and the pursued vehicle is driven in a
> willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, the
> person driving the vehicle, upon conviction, shall be punished by
> imprisonment in the state prison, or by confinement in the county jail
> \.... The court may also impose a fine \... or may impose both that
> imprisonment or confinement and fine.
>
> "(b) For purposes of this section, a willful or wanton disregard for
> the safety of persons or property includes, but is not limited to,
> driving while fleeing or attempting to elude a pursuing peace officer
> during which time either three or more violations that are assigned a
> traffic violation point count under Section 12810 occur, or damage to
> property occurs."

In concluding that section 2800.2 is an inherently dangerous felony, the
Court of Appeal relied heavily on *People v. Johnson* (1993) 15
Cal.App.4th 169 \[18 Cal.Rptr.2d 650\]. There the Court of Appeal,
construing an earlier version of section 2800.2 that was essentially the
same as what is now subdivision (a) of that section, held that driving
with "willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property"
was inherently dangerous to life. We need not decide, however, whether
*Johnson* was correct, because in 1996, three years after *Johnson* was
decided, the Legislature amended section 2800.2 to add subdivision (b).
(Stats. 1996, ch. 420, § 1.) Subdivision (b) very broadly defines the
term "willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or
property," as used in subdivision (a), to include *any* flight from an
officer during which the motorist commits three traffic violations that
are assigned a "point count" under section 12810, or which results in
"damage to property."

Violations that are assigned points under section 12810 and can be
committed without endangering human life include driving an unregistered
vehicle owned by the driver (§§ 40001, 12810, subds. (e), (g)(1)),
driving with a suspended license (§§ 14601, 12810, subd. (i)), driving
on a highway at slightly more than 55 miles per hour when a higher speed
limit has not been posted (§§ 22349, subd. (a), 12810, subd. (e)),
failing to come to a complete stop at a stop sign (§§ 22450, 12810,
subd. (e)), and making a right turn without signaling for 100 feet
before turning (§§ 22108, 12810, subd. (e)).

The Court of Appeal **\[ ... \]** concluded that subdivision (b) "did
not change the elements of the section 2800.2 offense, in the abstract,
or its inherently dangerous nature." (Sewell, at p. 694.) But, as we
pointed out in the preceding paragraph, subdivision (b) greatly expanded
the meaning of the quoted statutory phrase to include conduct that
ordinarily would not be considered particularly dangerous.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6edd2bbde8dec0d52edf9972e198b6fa73f885c)

In the absence of any evidence of legislative intent, we assume that the
Legislature contemplated that we would determine the application of the
second degree felony-murder rule to violations of section 2800.2 based
on our long-established decisions holding that the rule applies only to
felonies that are inherently dangerous in the *abstract.* **\[ ... \]**
As we have explained in this opinion, a violation of section 2800.2 is
not, in the abstract, inherently dangerous to human life. Therefore, the
second degree felony-murder rule does not apply when a killing occurs
during a violation of section 2800.2.

**\[ ... \]**

Conclusion

Nothing here should be read as saying that a motorist who kills an
innocent person in a hazardous, high-speed flight from a police officer
should *not* be convicted of murder. A jury may well find that the
motorist has acted with malice by driving with conscious disregard for
the lives of others, and thus is guilty of murder. **\[ ... \]**But,
**\[ ... \]**the prosecution may not (as it did here) resort to the
second degree felony-murder rule to remove from the jury's consideration
the question whether a killing that occurred during a violation of
section 2800.2 was done with malice.[**\[ ...

BROWN, J., Concurring and Dissenting.

I concur with the majority's holding that defendant's conviction for
second degree felony murder must be reversed **\[ ... \]**. However,
**\[ ... \]**I cannot countenance the majority's continued allegiance to
this dubious doctrine.

Here, defendant was convicted solely on a second degree felony-murder
theory. The majority appears to acknowledge the rule is constitutionally
and analytically suspect**\[ ... \]** I agree, but I would go farther
and abrogate the rule entirely. **\[ ... \]** As the facts of this case
conclusively demonstrate, the application of the second degree
felony-murder rule remains irredeemably arbitrary.

The majority concludes, based on a technical parsing of the provision's
grammar, that a violation of Vehicle Code section 2800.2 is not an
inherently dangerous felony for purposes of second degree felony murder.
However, a commonsense construction of the statute's language leads to
the opposite conclusion---a conclusion that is considerably less
counterintuitive. As one lower court stated in addressing the same issue
we review here, "It would seem clear as a matter of logic that any
felony whose key element is 'wanton disregard' for human life
necessarily falls within the scope of 'inherently dangerous' felonies.
**\[ ... \]** \[A\]part from the 'wanton disregard' element, one must
also be engaged in the act of fleeing from a pursuing peace officer
whose vehicle is displaying lights and sirens. Any high-speed pursuit is
inherently dangerous to the lives of the pursuing police officers. In
even the most ethereal of abstractions, it is not possible to imagine
that the 'wanton disregard' of the person fleeing does not encompass
disregard for the safety of the pursuing officers." **\[ ... \]**Unlike
the majority, I find the Court of Appeal's statement in *Johnson*
persuasive.

Indeed, I agree with Justice Baxter that if any offense should easily
qualify as inherently dangerous, Vehicle Code section 2800.2 certainly
would. **\[ ... \]**

I would abrogate the nonstatutory second degree felony-murder rule and
leave it to the Legislature to define precisely what conduct subjects a
defendant to strict criminal liability.

BAXTER, J., Dissenting.

**\[ ... \]**

The majority focus upon subdivision (b) of section 2800.2, which was
added in 1996. **\[ ... \]** The majority reason that, because some
statutory "points" violations are not inherently dangerous, one can
commit the unitary felony described in both subdivisions of section
2800.2 in a way that does not place human life at risk.

I am not persuaded. Subdivision (a) of section 2800.2 gives clear and
specific notice that one who, in order to elude police pursuit, drives
with reckless indifference to safety is guilty of a felony. Such
reckless driving is, of course, inherently dangerous---by definition, it
creates a substantial risk that someone will be killed. Moreover, there
is no doubt that defendant committed exactly the reckless endangerment
of human life forbidden by the statute. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

*\[Here,\]* principal reason for applying the felony-murder rule is
present. The purpose of the felony-murder doctrine " 'is to deter those
engaged in felonies from killing negligently or accidentally.' "
*(Hansen, supra, 9* Cal.4th 300, 308, quoting *People v. Satchell*
(1971) 6 Cal.3d 28, 43 \[98 Cal.Rptr. 33, 489 P.2d 1361\].) Because the
doctrine absolves the prosecution from proving malice, it properly
applies when " 'the killer is engaged in a felony whose inherent danger
to human life renders logical an imputation of malice on the part of all
who commit it.' " *(Ibid.)*

Those requirements are met here. It is appropriate to deter persons from
killing negligently or accidentally---as did defendant---while
engaged---as was defendant---in recklessly unsafe driving to elude
police pursuit, a specific form of conduct made felonious by section
2800.2, subdivision (a). Moreover, the inherent danger such conduct
poses to human life is so clear that it is logical to impute malice to
anyone who commits it.

Under such circumstances, it perverts reason to refuse to apply the
felony-murder rule simply because subdivision (b) of section 2800.2 may
additionally describe a nondangerous felony. Where society has warned,
in plain statutory words, that the particular conduct committed by the
defendant is both dangerous and felonious, it should not matter that the
statute may forbid nondangerous conduct as well.[^45]

It is worth noting that, although the Legislature elected to include
subdivision (b) as part of section 2800.2, it could just as easily have
added a separate section, establishing a distinct felonious offense of
committing three "points" violations while driving to elude a peace
officer. This would equally have satisfied the apparent legislative
purpose to deter flight from the police by expanding the circumstances
under which driving to elude a pursuing police officer would constitute
a felony. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** If subdivision (a) described an inherently dangerous
felony before the addition of subdivision (b) in 1996 **\[ ... \]**, the
unchanged words of that subdivision equally do so following the 1996
amendment **\[ ... \]**.

Notes & Questions (People v. Howard)

 

 

**Notes and Questions**

1.      *Inherently Dangerous.* The court suggests that the Felony
Murder rule should be limited only to inherently dangerous felonies. Why
do you think that is? What problems can you see arising from the
requirement for felonies to be "inherently dangerous?

2.      *The "Abstract" Test.* Most states determine whether or not a
felony is inherently dangerous based on the facts of the case.
California applies the "abstract" test, which is discussed in the
*Howard* case. What purpose does the "abstract" test serve? How about
the application of facts to the case?

CHIN, J.

In this murder case, the trial court instructed the jury on second
degree felony murder with shooting at an occupied vehicle under Penal
Code section 246, the underlying felony.[^46] We granted review to
consider various issues concerning the validity and scope of the second
degree felony-murder rule.

We first discuss the rule's constitutional basis. Although the rule has
long been part of our law, some members of this court have questioned
its constitutional validity. We conclude that the rule is based on
statute, specifically section 188's definition of implied malice, and
hence is constitutionally valid.

Next we reconsider the contours of the so-called merger doctrine this
court adopted in *People v. Ireland* (1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 \[75 Cal.Rptr.
188, 450 P.2d 580\] *(Ireland).* After reviewing recent developments,
primarily some of our own decisions, we conclude the current state of
the law in this regard is untenable. We will overrule some of our
decisions and hold that all assaultive-type crimes, such as a violation
of section 246, merge with the charged homicide and cannot be the basis
for a second degree felony-murder instruction. **\[ ... \]**

I. Facts and Procedural History

We take our facts primarily from the Court of Appeal's opinion.

Judy Onesavanh and Sophal Ouch were planning a party for their son's
birthday. Around 9:00 p.m. on September 13, 2003, they and a friend,
Bounthavy Onethavong, were driving to the store in Stockton in a blue
Mitsubishi that Onesavanh's father owned. Onesavanh's brother, George,
also drives the car. The police consider George to be highly ranked in
the Asian Boys street gang (Asian Boys).

That evening Ouch was driving, with Onesavanh in the front passenger
seat and Onethavong behind Ouch. While they were stopped in the left
turn lane at a traffic light, a blue Honda with tinted windows pulled up
beside them. When the light changed, gunfire erupted from the Honda,
hitting all three occupants of the Mitsubishi. Onethavong was killed,
having received two bullet wounds in the head. Onesavanh was hit in the
back and seriously wounded. Ouch was shot in the cheek and suffered a
fractured jaw.

**\[ ... \]**

Two months after the shooting, the police stopped a van while
investigating another suspected gang shooting. Defendant was a passenger
in the van. He was arrested and subsequently made two statements
regarding the shooting in this case. He admitted he was in the backseat
of the Honda at the time; T-Bird was the driver and there were two other
passengers. Later, he also admitted he fired a .38-caliber firearm. He
said he did not point the gun at anyone; he just wanted to scare them.

Defendant, who was 16 years old at the time of the shooting, was tried
as an adult for his role in the shooting. He was charged with murder,
with driveby and gang special circumstances, and with two counts of
attempted murder, discharging a firearm from a vehicle, and shooting
into an occupied vehicle, all with gang and firearm-use allegations**\[
... \]**

**\[ ... \]** The jury found defendant guilty of second degree
*\[felony\] murder*. **\[ ... \]**

The Court of Appeal**\[ ... \]** reversed the murder conviction**\[ ...
\]**. **\[ ... \]** It explained: "Second degree felony murder, the only
express theory of second degree murder offered to the jury, was based on
the underlying felony of shooting into an occupied vehicle. The merger
doctrine prevents using an assaultive-type crime as the basis for felony
murder unless the underlying crime is committed with an intent
collateral to committing an injury that would cause death. Without the
evidence of defendant's statements about the shooting, there was no
evidence from which a collateral intent or purpose could be found.
Accordingly, it was error to instruct on second degree felony murder and
the murder conviction must be reversed."

**\[ ... \]**

II\. Discussion

A. *The Constitutionality of the Second Degree Felony-murder Rule*

Defendant contends California's second degree felony-murder rule is
unconstitutional on separation of power grounds as a judicially created
doctrine with no statutory basis. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The second degree felony-murder rule is venerable. It "has been a part
of California's criminal law for many decades. **\[ ... \]**

But some former and current members of this court have questioned the
rule's validity because no statute specifically addresses it. **\[ ...
\]**

In line with these concerns, defendant argues that the second degree
felony-murder rule is invalid on separation of powers grounds. As he
points out, we have repeatedly said that " 'the power to define crimes
and fix penalties is vested exclusively in the legislative branch.'
*(Keeler* v. *Superior Court\[, supra,\]* 2 Cal.3d 619, 631 \... ;
\[citations\].)" *(People* v. *Superior Court (Romero)* (1996) 13
Cal.4th 497, 516 \[53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628\].) Defendant asks
rhetorically, "How, then, in light of the statutory abrogation of common
law crimes and the constitutional principle of separation of powers,
does second degree felony murder continue to exist when this court has
repeatedly acknowledged that the crime is a judicial creation?"

This court has never directly addressed these concerns and this
argument, or explained the statutory basis of the second degree
felony-murder rule. We do so now. We agree with Justice Panelli that
there are no nonstatutory crimes in this state. Some statutory or
regulatory provision must describe conduct as criminal in order for the
courts to treat that conduct as criminal. (§ 6.)[^47] But, as we
explain, the second degree felony-murder rule, although derived from the
common law, is based on statute; it is simply another interpretation of
section 188's "abandoned and malignant heart" language.

**\[ ... \]**

B. *The Merger Doctrine and Second Degree Felony Murder*

Although today we reaffirm the constitutional validity of the
longstanding second degree felony-murder rule, we also recognize that
the rule has often been criticized and, indeed, described as
disfavored.**\[ ... \]** We have repeatedly stated, as recently as 2005,
that the rule " ' "deserves no extension beyond its required
application." ' " *(People v. Howard, supra,* 34 Cal.4th at p. 1135.)
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The merger doctrine developed due to the understanding that the
underlying felony must be an independent crime and not merely the
killing itself. Thus, certain underlying felonies "merge" with the
homicide and cannot be used for purposes of felony murder. The specific
question before us is how to apply the merger doctrine. **\[ ... \]**

1\. *Historical Review*

The merger doctrine arose in the seminal case of *Ireland, supra,* 70
Cal.2d 522, and hence sometimes is called the *"Ireland* merger
doctrine." In *Ireland,* the defendant shot and killed his wife, and was
convicted of second degree murder. The trial court instructed the jury
on second degree felony murder with assault with a deadly weapon the
underlying felony. We held the instruction improper, adopting the
"so-called 'merger' doctrine" that had previously been developed in
other jurisdictions. *(Id.* at p. 540.) We explained our reasons:
"\[T\]he utilization of the felony-murder rule in circumstances such as
those before us extends the operation of that rule 'beyond any rational
function that it is designed to serve.' *(People* v. *Washington* (1965)
62 Cal.2d *777,* 783 \[44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130\].) To allow such
use of the felony-murder rule would effectively preclude the jury from
considering the issue of malice aforethought in all cases wherein
homicide has been committed as a result of a felonious assault---a
category which includes the great majority of all homicides. This kind
of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law. We therefore
hold that a second degree felony-murder instruction may not properly be
given when it is based upon a felony which is an integral part of the
homicide and which the evidence produced by the prosecution shows to be
an offense included *in fact* within the offense charged."**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In *People* v. *Smith* (1984) 35 Cal.3d 798 \[201 Cal.Rptr. 311, 678
P.2d 886\], the defendant was convicted of the second degree murder of
her two-year-old daughter. We had to decide whether the trial court
correctly instructed the jury on second degree felony murder with felony
child abuse (now § 273a, subd. (a)) the underlying felony. We reviewed
some of the felonies that do not merge but found them distinguishable.
*(People v. Smith, supra,* at p. 805.) We explained that the crime at
issue was "child abuse of the assaultive variety" for which we could
"conceive of no independent purpose." *(Id.* at p. 806.) Accordingly, we
concluded that the offense merged with the resulting homicide, and that
the trial court erred in instructing on felony murder.

**\[ ... \]**

The most recent significant development is the Court of Appeal's opinion
in this case. **\[ ... \]** After reviewing other recent cases, it
stated, "From this muddled state of the law, we discern the rule to be
that second degree felony murder is applicable to an assaultive-type
crime, such as when shooting at a person is involved, provided that the
crime was committed with a purpose independent of and collateral to
causing injury. Since the Supreme Court could have upheld instruction on
felony murder in *Randle* on the basis that most homicides are not
committed by negligently discharging a gun and did not, we conclude the
collateral purpose rule is the proper test of merger in these types of
cases."

**\[ ... \]**

2\. *Analysis*

The current state of the law regarding the *Ireland* merger doctrine is
problematic**\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]**

In light of these problems, we conclude we need to reconsider our merger
doctrine jurisprudence. As Justice Werdegar observed in her dissenting
opinion in *Robertson,* "sometimes consistency must yield to a better
understanding of the developing law." *(Robertson, supra,* 34 Cal.4th at
p. 185.) In considering this question, we must also keep in mind the
purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule. We have identified
two. The purpose we have most often identified "is to deter felons from
killing negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly responsible
for killings they commit." *(People v. Washington, supra,* 62 Cal.2d at
p. 781.) Another purpose is to deter commission of the inherently
dangerous felony itself. *(Robertson, supra,* 34 Cal.4th at p. 171 **\[
... \]**)

**\[ ... \]**

To avoid the anomaly of putting a person who merely intends to frighten
the victim in a worse legal position than the person who actually
intended to shoot at the victim, and the difficult question of whether
and how the jury should decide questions of merger, we need to
reconsider our holdings in *Robertson, supra,* 34 Cal.4th 156, and
*Randle, supra,* 35 Cal.4th 987. When the underlying felony is
assaultive in nature, such as a violation of section 246 or 246.3, we
now conclude that the felony merges with the homicide and cannot be the
basis of a felony-murder instruction. An "assaultive" felony is one that
involves a threat of immediate violent injury. **\[ ... \]**

This conclusion is also consistent with our repeatedly stated view that
the felony-murder rule should not be extended beyond its required
application. *(People v. Howard, supra,* 34 Cal.4th at p. 1135.) We do
not have to decide at this point exactly what felonies are assaultive in
nature, and hence may not form the basis of a felony-murder instruction,
and which are inherently collateral to the resulting homicide and do not
merge. But shooting at an occupied vehicle under section 246 is
assaultive in nature and hence cannot serve as the underlying felony for
purposes of the felony-murder rule.[**\[ ...

MORENO, J., Concurring and Dissenting.

The second degree felony-murder mle is deeply flawed. The majority
attempts once more to patch this judicially created mle and improves the
state of the law considerably, but several years ago I expressed my
willingness to "reassess\[\] the rule in an appropriate case." **\[ ...
\]**This is that case. The time has come to abandon the second degree
felony-murder mle.

**\[ ... \]**

In most instances, a juror who finds that the defendant killed the
victim while committing a felony that is inherently dangerous to human
life necessarily also will conclude that the defendant harbored either
express or implied malice and thus committed second degree murder
without relying upon the second degree felony-murder rule. Only in those
rare cases in which it is not clear that the defendant acted in
conscious disregard of fife will the second degree felony-murder rule
make a difference, but those are precisely the rare cases in which the
rule might result in injustice. I would eliminate the second degree
felony-murder rule and rely instead upon the wisdom of juries to
recognize those situations in which a defendant commits second degree
murder by killing the victim during the commission of a felony that is
inherently dangerous to life.

Notes & Questions (People v. Chun)

 

 

1.      *Why the Merger Doctrine?* What is the rationale for the merger
limitation on the felony-murder rule, as the *Chun* court conceives it?

2.       *Another View:* According to the Tennessee Supreme Court

Court\'s have viewed the merger doctrine as a \[non-constitutional\]
principle for discerning legislative intent and, more specifically, as a
principle that preserves "some meaningful domain in which the
Legislature\'s careful graduation of homicide offenses can be
implemented.\" \* \* \* The doctrine has largely been applied in those
states where the felony murder statute fails to specifically list the
felonies capable of supporting a felony murder conviction. Where a
"legislature explicitly states that a particular felony is a predicate
felony for felony-murder, no \'merger\' occurs."

 

*State v. Godsey*, 60 S.W.3d 759, 774-75 (Tenn. 2001).

3.      *People v. Wilson*. In *People v. Wilson*, the California
Supreme Court held that the felony burglary in that case (the defendant
entered premises with intent to commit an assault) merged with the
homicide. Therefore, the court ruled, the defendant could not be
convicted of first-degree felony-murder. Now look at the California
Penal Code and consider Note 2. Why does Wilson seem wrongly decided?
Why, indeed, did the California Supreme Court overrule Wilson in 2009?
*People v. Farley*, 46 Cal. 4th 1053, 96 Cal. Rptr. 3d 191, 210 P.3d 361
(2009).

Why is Wilson also wrongly decided in light of *Chun*?

4.      *A True Hypothetical.* Robert Champion, a member of the Florida
A&M marching band, died as the result of a severe beating by thirteen
other members of the band, as part of hazing ritual, referred to as
"Crossing Bus C," in which band members must walk from the front of the
bus to the back while other band members kick, punch, and hit them with
straps, drum sticks and other objects. Champion died from "blunt force
trauma" to his head. A number of the band members were charged with
felony-murder, based on the following statutory provision:

(1)As used in this section, "hazing" means any action or situation that
recklessly or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health or
safety of a student for purposes including, but not limited to,
initiation or admission into or affiliation with any organization
operating under the sanction of a postsecondary institution. "Hazing"
includes, but is not limited to, pressuring or coercing the student into
violating state or federal law, any brutality of a physical nature \* \*
\*, exposure to the elements, forced consumption of any food, liquor,
drug, or other substance, or other forced physical activity that could
adversely affect the physical health or safety of the student, and also
includes any activity that would subject the student to extreme mental
stress, such as sleep 354deprivation, forced exclusion from social
contact, forced conduct that could result in extreme embarrassment, or
other forced activity that could adversely affect the mental health or
dignity of the student. \* \* \*

 

(2)A person commits hazing, a third degree felony \* \* \* when he or
she intentionally or recklessly commits any act of hazing as defined in
subsection (1) upon another person who is a member of or an applicant to
any type of student organization and the hazing results in serious
bodily injury or death of such other person.

No. 82,647

2001-03-09

(19 P.3d 70)

**\[ ... \]**

Larson, J.:

This is Sanexay Sophophone's direct appeal of his felony-murder
conviction for the death of his co-felon during flight from an
aggravated burglary in which both men participated.

The facts are not in dispute. Sophophone and three other individuals
**\[ ... \]** broke into a house in Emporia. The resident reported the
break-in to the police.

Police officers responded to the call, saw four individuals leaving the
back of the house**\[ ... \]** ordered them to stop. The individuals,
one being Sophophone, started to run away. One officer ran down
Sophophone, hand-cuffed him, and placed him in a police car.

**\[ ... \]** An officer chased one of the suspects later identified as
Somphone Sysoumphone. **\[ ... \]**The officer approached with his
weapon drawn and ordered Sysoumphone to the ground and not to move.
Sysoumphone was lying face down but raised up and fired at the officer,
who returned fire and killed him. It is not disputed that Sysoumphone
was one of the individuals observed by the officers leaving the house
that had been burglarized.

Sophophone was charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary,
**\[ ... \]**aggravated burglary, **\[ ... \]**and felony murder**\[ ...
\]**.

Sophophone moved to dismiss the felony-murder charges, contending the
complaint was defective because **\[ ... \]**the police officer had
killed Sysoumphone *\[rather than he or one of his co-felons,
and\]*further because he was in custody and sitting in the police car
when the deceased was killed and therefore not attempting to commit or
even fleeing from an inherently dangerous felony. His motion to dismiss
was denied by the trial court.

Sophophone was convicted by a jury of all counts. **\[ ... \]**

The applicable provisions of K.S.A. 21-3401 read as follows:

> "Murder in the first degree is the killing of a human being committed:
>
> "(b) in the commission of, attempt to commit, or flight from an
> inherently dangerous felony as defined in K.S.A. 21-3436 and
> amendments thereto."

Aggravated burglary is one of the inherently dangerous felonies as
enumerated by K.S.A. 21-3436(10).

Sophophone does not dispute that aggravated burglary is an inherently
dangerous felony which given the right circumstances would support a
felony-murder charge. His principal argument centers on his being in
custody at the time his co-felon was killed by the lawful act of the
officer which he contends was a "break in circumstances" sufficient to
insulate him from further criminal responsibility.

This "intervening cause" or "break in circumstances" argument has no
merit under the facts of this case. We have held in numerous cases that
"time, distance, and the causal relationship between the underlying
felony and a killing are factors to be considered in determining whether
the killing occurs in the commission of the underlying felony and the
defendant is therefore subject to the felony-murder rule." **\[ ... \]**
Based on the uncontroverted evidence in this case, the killing took
place during flight from the aggravated burglary, and it is only because
the act which resulted in the killing was a lawful one by a third party
that a question of law exists as to whether Sophophone can be convicted
of felony murder.

**\[ ... \]**

*\[W\]*e look to the prevailing views concerning the applicability of
the felony-murder doctrine where the killing has been caused by the acts
of a third party. **\[ ... \]**

In Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law, **\[ ... \]**the question is
posed of whether the felony-murder rule should apply when the fatal act
is performed by a non-felon. Dressier states:

> "This issue has perplexed courts. Two approaches to the question have
> been considered and applied by the courts.
>
> "\[b\] The 'Agency' Approach
>
> "The majority rule is that the felony-murder doctrine does not apply
> if the person who directly causes the death is a non-felon. . . .
>
> "The reasoning of this approach stems from accomplice liability
> theory. Generally speaking, the acts of the primary party (the person
> who directly commits the offense) are imputed to an accomplice on the
> basis of the agency doctrine. It is as if the accomplice says to the
> primary party: 'Your acts are my acts.' It follows that \[a co-felon\]
> cannot be convicted of the homicides because the primary party was not
> die person widi whom she was an accomplice. It is not possible to
> impute die acts of the antagonistic party --- \[die non-felon or\] the
> police officer --- to \[a co-felon\] on the basis of agency.
>
> "\[c\] The 'Proximate Causation' Approach
>
> "An alternative dieory, followed by a few courts for awhile, holds
> that a felon may be held responsible under the felony-murder rule for
> a killing committed by a non-felon if the felon set in motion the acts
> which resulted in the victim's deadi.
>
> "Pursuant to diis rule, the issue becomes one of proximate causation:
> if an act by one felon is the proximate cause of the homicidal conduct
> by \[die non-felon\] or the police officer, murder liability is
> permitted."

**\[ ... \]**

The leading case adopting the agency approach is *Commonwealth v.
Redline,* 391 Pa. 486, 495, 137 A.2d 472 (1958), where the underlying
principle of the agency theory is described as follows:

> "In adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times
> that the thing which is imputed to a felon for a killing incidental to
> his felony is malice and not the act of killing. The mere coincidence
> of homicide and felony is not enough to satisfy the felony-murder
> doctrine."

The following statement *from Redline* is more persuasive for
Sophophone:

> "In the present instance, the victim of the homicide was one of the
> robbers who, while resisting apprehension in his effort to escape, was
> shot and killed by a policeman in the performance of his duty. Thus,
> the homicide was justifiable and, obviously, could not be availed of,
> on any rational legal theory, to support a charge of murder. How can
> anyone, no matter how much of an outlaw he may be, have a criminal
> charge lodged against him for the consequences of the lawful conduct
> of another person? The mere question carries with it its own answer."
> **\[ ... \]**

The minority of the states whose courts have adopted the proximate cause
theory believe their legislatures intended that any person, co-felon, or
accomplice who commits an inherently dangerous felony should be held
responsible for any death which is a direct and foreseeable consequence
of the actions of those committing the felony. These courts apply the
civil law concept of proximate cause to felony-murder situations.**\[
... \]**

It appears to the majority that to impute the act of killing to
Sophophone when the act was the lawful and courageous one of a law
enforcement officer acting in the line of his duties is contrary to the
strict construction we are required to give criminal statutes. There is
considerable doubt about the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3401(b) as applied to
the facts of this case, and we believe that making one criminally
responsible for the lawful acts of a law enforcement officer is not the
intent of the felony-murder statute as it is currently written. **\[ ...
\]**

We hold that under the facts of this case where the killing resulted
from the lawful acts of a law enforcement officer in attempting to
apprehend a co-felon, Sophophone is not criminally responsible for the
resulting death of Somphone Sysoumphone, and his felony-murder
conviction must be reversed.

**\[ ... \]**

Abbott, J.,

dissenting: **\[ ... \]**

When an issue requires statutory analysis and the statute is
unambiguous, we are limited by the wording chosen by the legislature. We
are not free to alter the statutory language, regardless of the result.
In the present case, the felony-murder statute does not require us to
adopt the "agency" theory favored by the majority. Indeed, there is
nothing in the statute which establishes an agency approach. The statute
does not address the issue at all. The requirements, according to the
statute, are: (1) there must be a killing, and (2) the killing must be
committed in the commission, attempt to commit, or flight from an
inherently dangerous felony. The statute simply does not contain the
limitations discussed by the majority. **\[ ... \]** The facts in this
case, in my opinion, satisfy all of the requirements set forth in K.S.A.
21-3401(b).

**\[ ... \]**

Here, Sophophone set in motion acts which would have resulted in the
death or serious injury of a law enforcement officer had it not been for
the highly alert law enforcement officer. This set of events could have
very easily resulted in the death of a law enforcement officer, and in
my opinion this is exactly the type of case the legislature had in mind
when it adopted the felony-murder rule.

Notes & Questions (State v. Sophophone)

 

**Notes and Questions**

1.      *Two Opinions.* After reviewing both the majority and the
dissent in *Sophophone*, which approach do you find more persuasive?

2.      *The Res Gestae Doctrine*. If a felon kills someone shortly
after the perpetration of the crime, some courts treat the death as
within the scope of the felony murder rule. This is because the death is
considered as falling with the "res gestae" (latin for: "the things
done") of the felony, as long as the death is considered to be part of a
continuous transaction of the felony.

       For example, in *People v. Matos*, a robber fled onto a rooftop,
and a police officer in pursuit plummeted to his
death.[^\[1\]^](#X8bdd88a3bf01084eca24a550ca309dc861690a6) The felony
murder rule applies in this circumstance. In another example, the
perpetrator of a home invasion fled from the police, which culminated in
a collision with a civilian vehicle, killing its occupants. This crash
occurred ten minutes and ten miles away from the scene of the
felony.[^\[2\]^](#Xd9e470bd5507ad9630a421e059817cb77c2330a)

        In order to use this doctrine, though the causal relationship
between the killing and the felony has to be established. Above and
beyond that, though, simple "but-for" causation between the killing and
the felony is often not enough. In other words, the felony must also be
a proximate cause of the death.

        Concurring in *People v. Hudson*, Justice Freeman developed this
hypothetical:

Defendant X robs an individual at gunpoint. During the robbery,
defendant X accidentally discharges the gun. At the forest preserve two
blocks away, the victim is riding a horse. The horse bolts at the sound
of the gunshot, crosses a busy street, and throws the victim to the
ground. An oncoming car cannot stop in a timely fashion and runs over
the victim, inflicting the injuries that result in the
death.[^\[3\]^](#X41190ffb67fdba6fad4ee9dd6fd047edd11cfdb)

        In this hypothetical, but for X's firing the gun, the horse
would not have bolted, resulting in the victim's death. A proximate
causation analysis that considers the role of the intervening causes is
necessary to determine X's responsibility for the victim's death.

Attempt

 

Attempt, an "inchoate" offense, lies somewhere between merely thinking
about committing a crime and successfully completing it. If they
haven\'t yet acted, how do we know they would have committed the crime?
How far should someone have to go before their actions are criminal? How
seriously should we punish someone who fully intends and attempts to
commit a crime---say, fires a bullet intending to kill a person, but
misses? Should they be punished less severly if they are stopped before
they fire the bulllet? The cases in this section consider the level of
mens rea and actus reus needed for an attempted crime. Notice how the
court adjusts these requirements in attempt cases to balance a broad
variety of social aims, such as blameworthiness; deterrence; minimizing
the arbitrariness of criminal punishment; and giving potential criminals
the incentive to change their minds.

American Law Institute---Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to
Article 5, (1985), 293--294.

 

Article 5 \[of the Model Penal Code\] undertakes to deal systematically
with \[the crimes of\] attempt, solicitation and conspiracy. These
offenses have in common the fact that they deal with conduct that is
designed to culminate in the commission of a substantive offense, but
has failed in the discrete case to do so or has not yet achieved its
culmination because there is something that the actor or another still
must do. The offenses are inchoate in this sense.

These, to be sure, are not the only crimes so defined that their
commission does not rest on proof of the occurrence of the evil that it
is the object of the law to prevent; many specific, substantive offenses
also have a large inchoate aspect. This is true not only with respect to
crimes of risk creation, such as reckless driving, or specific crimes of
preparation, such as possession with unlawful purpose. It is also true,
at least in part, of crimes like larceny, forgery, kidnapping and even
arson, not to speak of burglary, where a purpose to cause greater harm
than that which is implicit in the actor's conduct is an element of the
offense. This reservation notwithstanding, attempt, solicitation and
conspiracy have such generality of definition and of application as
inchoate crimes that it is useful \* \* \* to confront the common
problems they present.

\* \* \* General deterrence is at most a minor function to be served in
fashioning provisions of the penal law addressed to these inchoate
crimes; that burden is discharged upon the whole by the law dealing with
the substantive offenses.

Other and major functions of the penal law remain, however, to be
served. They may be summarized as follows:

First: When a person is seriously dedicated to commission of a crime, a
firm legal basis is needed for the intervention of the agencies of law
enforcement to prevent its consummation. In determining that basis,
there must be attention to the danger of abuse; equivocal behavior may
be misconstrued by an unfriendly eye as preparation to commit a crime.
It is no less important, on the other side, that lines should not be
drawn so rigidly that the police confront insoluble dilemmas in deciding
when to intervene, facing the risk that if they wait the crime may be
committed while if they act they may not yet have any valid charge.

Second: Conduct designed to cause or culminate in the commission of a
crime obviously yields an indication that the actor is disposed towards
such activity, not alone on this occasion but on others. There is a
need, therefore, subject again to proper safeguards, for a legal basis
upon which the special danger that such individuals present may be
assessed and dealt with. They must be made amenable to the corrective
process that the law provides.

Third: Finally, and quite apart from these considerations of prevention,
when the actor's failure to commit the substantive offense is due to a
fortuity, as when the bullet misses in attempted murder or when the
expected response to solicitation is withheld, his exculpation on that
ground would involve inequality of treatment that would shock the common
sense of justice. Such a situation is unthinkable in any mature system
designed to serve the proper goals of penal law.

Notes and Questions - MPC Comment to Article 5

 

1.  Professor Ira Robbins has noted: 

The inchoate crimes of attempt, conspiracy, and solicitation are well
established in the American legal system. "Inchoate" offenses allow
punishment of an actor even though he has not consummated the crime that
is the object of his efforts. \* \* \*

Most American jurisdictions treat inchoate offenses as substantive
crimes, distinct and divorced from the completed crimes toward which
they tend. Accordingly, attempt, conspiracy, and solicitation are
defined broadly to encompass acts leading to the commission of any
completed crime. Rather than try to enumerate every act to which
inchoate liability attaches, however, legislatures have enacted
relatively short statutes containing abstract conceptual terms with
universal application. The Model Penal Code's provision for attempt
liability, for example, represents a middle-ground approach to this
problem. It prohibits an act that constitutes a "substantial step"
toward the completed offense. The Code then fleshes out the abstract
term "substantial step" by listing several nonexclusive examples that
have application to numerous completed crimes. It has fallen to the
courts to elaborate on the scope of inchoate offenses and decide when to
administer them.

Thus, the concept of substantive inchoate crimes, by requiring a high
degree of judicial interpretation, has vested great discretion in the
judiciary. This discretion is similar to that of earlier courts in
creating common-law offenses. In both circumstances, the court analyzes
the policies underlying the criminal law and decides whether those
policies require courts to punish certain acts.

2.  Professor Robbins goes on to explain that inchoate offenses are
    often broadly and abstractly defined, which leaves quite a bit of
    leeway for judicial interpretation:

The Model Penal Code\'s provision for attempt liability, for example,
represents a middle-ground approach to this problem. It prohibits an act
that constitutes a \"substantial step\" toward the completed offense.
The Code then fleshes out the abstract term \"substantial step\" by
listing several nonexclusive examples that have application to numerous
completed crimes. It has fallen to the courts to elaborate on the scope
of inchoate offenses and decide when to administer them. Thus, the
concept of substantive inchoate crimes, by requiring a high degree of
judicial interpretation, has vested great discretion in the judiciary.

3.  After reading the excerpts by Professor Robbins, what are the best
    arguments in favor of punishing inchoate crimes? What are the types
    of harm that punishment of these crimes seeks to avoid? How does
    this map on to our four main justifications for punishment? Are
    there any that do not apply? 

4.  Have you looked up the definition of "inchoate"? Do you find that
    the definition of inchoate lends itself to ambiguity? How can we
    resolve this ambiguity? What are some ways in which this ambiguity
    might resolve itself in unequal ways? 

5.  Given that law enforcement officers have to make decisions based on
    limited information, doesn\'t this lend itself towards systematic or
    implicit biases? What might we do to prevent this? Do inchoate
    crimes necessarily risk punishing people for "bad thoughts" or
    "suspicious looking behavior?"

of a crime equivalent for our purposes to attempted murder. After
serving several months of a two year sentence he was paroled. However,
three months later his son, who had been hospitalized since the attack,
took a turn for the worse and died, whereupon the prosecutor, quite
within the law, charged the father with murder, a crime punishable with
life imprisonment or death.

What did the father do in jail or on parole that merited the greater
punishment? Not a thing. If a good constitution or a good surgeon had
saved the son, the father could not have been further punished. The
occurrence of the resulting death alone raises the crime and the
punishment. In most jurisdictions this same principle operates for all
crimes, not just homicidal crimes. In California, for example, an
attempt to commit a crime is punishable with half the punishment for the
completed crime. Thus, the reward for failing, no matter how hard you
try to succeed or how close you come, is a lesser punishment.

2.  A rise in aggravated assault: According to the [Bureau of Justice
    Statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf), rates of
    homicides in the United States have largely remained stagnant,
    however Professor Anthony Harris, the director of the Criminal
    Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts, notes that rates
    of aggravated assault have risen exponentially. Professor Harris
    indicates that discrepancy is largely due to innovations in trauma
    care. Thus, it follows that what might have resulted in a homicide
    in previous decades, is today able to be prosecuted as an attempted
    murder.

Assault 1960--1999, 6 Homicide Stud. 128 (2002).

3.  How should we punish attempt: Should the crime of attempt be equal
    to or less equal in severity of punishment to the target crime?
    Should conviction or sentencing be influenced based on whether the
    target crime was thwarted by extenuating circumstances (such as law
    enforcement interference) or whether the perpetrator abandoned the
    target crime of their own volition? How might these map on to our
    discussion about punishment? What might a prison abolitionist say
    about this?

Although the law of attempt has roots in the early English law, its
formulation as a general substantive offense is a relatively recent
development. \* \* \* Many American jurisdictions now make specific
provisions for the punishment of attempts to commit certain offenses,
and almost all cover the rest of the field with a general attempt
statute. With a few exceptions, these general statutes cover attempts to
commit any felony or misdemeanor.

Among modern American jurisdictions, \* \* \* the rule of merger
operates \* \* \* to the extent that a defendant cannot be convicted of
both a completed offense and an attempt to commit it. All jurisdictions
treat attempt as a lesser included offense of the completed crime.
Moreover, many jurisdictions have held that a defendant may be convicted
of the attempt if the state proves the completed crime, and several
states so provide by statute.

\* \* \* The principal purpose behind punishing an attempt \* \* \* is
not deterrence. The threat posed by the sanction for an attempt is
unlikely to deter a person willing to risk the penalty for the object
crime. Instead, the primary function of the crime of attempt is to
provide a basis for law-enforcement officers to intervene before an
individual can commit a completed offense.

Notes and Questions - Double Inchoate Crimes

 

 

1.  Criminal attempt arises in two permutations: incomplete and
    complete. An incomplete attempt is marked by an actor completing
    part of what they set out to do, but stopping short, whether of
    their own volition or because they were prevented from continuing by
    external factors (i.e. police intervention). A completed attempt
    occurs when the actor finishes performing the intended criminal act,
    but is unsuccessful in the intended result. (e.g. rather than
    exploding, the bomb fizzles).

People v. Gentry

 

Illinois Appellate Court

157 Ill. App. 3d 899

No. 84---2718

1987-06-18

**\[ ... \]**

JUSTICE LINN

delivered the opinion of the court:

Following a jury trial, defendant, Stanley Gentry, was convicted of
attempted murder (El. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, pars. 8 --- 4(a), 9 ---
1(a)) and aggravated battery (El. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 12 ---
4). At the sentencing hearing, the trial court merged the aggravated
battery conviction with the attempted murder conviction and on the
charge of attempted murder sentenced Gentry to the Illinois Department
of Corrections for a term of 45 years' imprisonment.

On appeal, Gentry asserts that his conviction should be reversed
because: (1) the trial court's instruction regarding the intent
necessáry for attempted murder was prejudicially erroneous; (2) the
State's use of certain hearsay statements denied Gentry a fair trial;
and (3) the prosecutor committed reversible error by making several
improper and prejudicial remarks during closing argument.

Background

The record indicates that on December 13, 1983, Gentry and Ruby Hill,
**\[ ... \]** began to argue. During the argument, Gentry spilled
gasoline on Hill, and the gasoline on Hill's body ignited. Gentry was
able to smother the flames with a coat, but only after Hill had been
severely burned. Gentry and Hill were the only eyewitnesses to the
incident.

**\[ ... \]**

Wayne Milla, a detective for the Chicago police department, also
testified**\[ ... \]**that he originally classified the fire as
"accidental" but later changed his mind when he discovered that Hill's
clothing had been doused with gasoline.

The victim, Ruby Hill, also testified at trial. Hill stated that she and
Gentry had been drinking all afternoon and that both of them were
"pretty high." She further testified that Gentry had poured gasoline on
her and that the gasoline ignited only after she had gone near the stove
in the kitchen. Hill also related how Gentry tried to snuff the fire out
by placing a coat over the flames.

Hill also testified as to her relationship with Gentry. She stated that
she had lived with Gentry for three years prior to the accident, that
she wanted to marry Gentry, and that she still loved Gentry
notwithstanding the fire incident. Hill claimed that the entire episode
was an accident and that she intended to again live with Gentry after
the case was over.

In addition, over the objection of Gentry's counsel, the prosecution
proffered **\[ ... \]** to impeach Hill as to her assertion that the
fire incident was an accident. The prosecution first established the
foundation for the impeachment by asking Hill if she had previously
claimed that Gentry had threatened her with matches after he had poured
gasoline on her. Hill denied it. The prosecution also asked her if she
had previously claimed that she was terrified of Gentry. Hill again
denied making such a statement. Hill also denied ever stating that she
was afraid of Gentry and denied that Gentry had ever tried to choke her
while she was taking a bath in the apartment's bathtub.

After Hill denied making positive answers to the aforementioned
questions posed by the prosecution, the prosecution set out to
"prove-up" the impeachment. First, the prosecution called Jeffrey
Zitzka, a Chicago police officer who interviewed Hill while she was in
the hospital after the incident. Zitzka testified that Hill had nodded
"no" when asked if the incident was an accident and had nodded "yes" as
to whether she wanted to press charges.

Diane Meyer, a law clerk for the State's Attorney's office, then
testified. Meyer stated that she had heard Hill tell prosecutors that
Gentry had lit matches after pouring gasoline on her, that Hill had
claimed that\' the incident was not an accident, and that Hill had also
said that she was afraid of Gentry.

Hill's brother, Bill Starnes, testified that Hill had previously told
him that Gentry had once tried to choke Hill while she was in the
bathtub. Hill's mother also testified. She stated that some time before
the incident, Hill had written a letter to her in which Hill claimed to
be "scared to death" of Gentry and that Gentry had once attempted to
choke her while she was in the apartment's bathtub.

**\[ ... \]**

At the close of the case, the jury found Gentry guilty of attempted
murder **\[ ... \]**

Gentry contends that the jury was improperly instructed on the required
mental state for attempted murder where the instructions given would
permit a conviction without a finding that Gentry possessed the specific
intent to kill. **\[ ... \]**

the specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of
attempted murder. **\[ ... \]**

At the . close of the presentation of evidence in this case, the
following instructions were given. First, the trial court defined
"attempt" as it relates to the underlying felony of murder:

> "A person commits the offense of murder when he, *with intent to
> commit the offense of murder* does any act which constitutes a
> substantial step toward the commission of the offense of murder. The
> offense attempted need not have been completed." (Emphasis added.)

Second, after giving this definition, the trial court set forth the
necessary elements of attempted murder, to wit, an act and intent:

> "To sustain the charge of attempt, the State must prove the following
> propositions:
>
> First: That the defendant performed an act which constituted a
> substantial step towards the commission of the offense of murder; and
>
> Second: That the defendant did so with *intent to commit the crime of
> murder."* (Emphasis added.)

Finally, the trial court defined the crime of murder, including all four
culpable mental states:

> "A person commits the crime of murder where he kills an individual if,
> in performing the acts which cause the death, he intends to kill *or*
> do great bodily harm to that individual; *or* he knows that such acts
> will cause death to that individual; *or* he knows that such acts
> create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that
> individual." (Emphasis added.)

Gentry contends that the inclusion of all the alternative states of mind
in the definitional murder instruction was erroneous because the crime
of attempted murder requires a showing of specific intent to kill.
Gentry, posits that inclusion of all four alternative states of mind
permitted the jury to convict him of attempted murder upon a finding
that he intended to harm Hill, or acted with the knowledge that his
conduct created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to
Hill, even if the jury believed that Gentry did not act with specific
intent to kill. We agree with Gentry's position that the jury was
misinstructed in this case.

Our supreme court has repeatedly held that a finding of specific intent
to kill is a necessary element of the crime of attempted murder. **\[
... \]** Indeed, a trial court instructing a jury on the crime of
attempted murder must make it clear that specific intent to kill is the
pivotal element of that offense, and that intent to do bodily harm, or
knowledge that the consequences of defendant's act may result in death
or great bodily harm, is not enough.**\[ ... \]** **\[ ...
\]**Accordingly, the instructions given in this case were erroneous,
since it is clear that the jury was permitted to convict Gentry without
specifically finding that Gentry intended to kill Hill. **\[ ... \]**

The State would read the attempted murder instruction as requiring a
showing of any of the alternative mental states sufficient for a
conviction of murder. In other words, the State makes no distinction
between the mental state required to prove murder and the mental state
required to prove attempted murder. We find the State's analysis and
conclusion to be erroneous and lacking in legal substance since it fails
to contain the judicial reasoning which recognizes the distinction
between the intent elements of murder and attempted murder.

Specifically, we cite the *Kraft* case, where defendant's attempted
murder conviction was reversed where the jury instructions would have
permitted a conviction without a finding of specific intent to kill.
*(People v. Kraft* (1985), 133 Ill. App. 3d 294, 478 N.E.2d 1154.) In
reversing the defendant's attempted murder conviction in that case, the
*Kraft* court analyzed the distinction between the culpable mental
states required for murder and attempted murder, noting as follows:

> "Our criminal code contains separate statutory definitions for the
> four culpable mental states of intent, knowledge, recklessness, and
> negligence, with knowledge encompassing a distinct and less purposeful
> state of mind than intent. \*\*\* \[0\]ur State legislature manifested
> a desire to treat intent and knowledge as distinct mental states when
> imposing criminal liability for conduct. \*\*\* Knowledge is not
> intent as defined by our statutes, and the jury instructions should
> reflect this distinction. Accordingly, we hold that in a prosecution
> for attempted murder, where alternative culpable mental states will
> satisfy the target crime of murder, but only one is compatible with
> the mental state imposed by our attempt statute, the incompatible
> elements must be omitted from the jury instructions." 133 Ill. App. 3d
> 294, 302, 478 N.E.2d 1154, 1160.

Consequently, it is sufficient only for us to say that we recognize the
distinction between the alternative states of mind delineated in the
definitional murder instruction, as well as the fact that only the
specific intent to kill satisfies the intent element of the crime of
attempted murder. Accordingly, the State's assertion that the
instructions as given actually required the jury to find that Gentry had
a specific intent to kill Hill is doomed.

**\[ ... \]**

In the instant case, it is clear that the essential task before the jury
was the determination of whether Gentry sufficiently formed the specific
intent to kill, in order to satisfy the elements of attempted murder.
**\[ ... \]** proving that Gentry formed the intent to kill was a
necessary predicate to a finding of his guilt.

**\[ ... \]**

In conclusion, based upon the discussion of law and fact stated above,
we reverse defendant's conviction and sentence and remand this cause for
a new trial in front of a properly instructed jury.

Reversed and remanded.

McMORROW, P.J., and JOHNSON, J., concur.

Notes and Questions - People v. Gentry

 

1.  Requisite intents for attempt. In order to secure an attempt
    conviction, two types of intent are necessary. The first form of
    intent is that the action taken by the actor must be intentional.
    The second form of intent is that the actor must intend to complete
    the target crime, while committing the acts that lead to attempt. 

For example: Suppose that Jair takes several gallons of gasoline and a
box of matches to Lindiwe's house. Jair dumps the gasoline all over the
house, but unbeknownst to him, the matches have been soaked in water and
will not light. On these facts, Jair could be charged with attempted
arson because 1) the act of dumping gasoline was intentionally performed
and 2) this action was arguably performed with the specific intention of
committing the target crime (arson). Note that both forms of intent must
be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In most attempt cases, the second
intent typically becomes the key mens rea issue. 

2.  Consider another example: Morley points a gun at a target which
    happens to be behind Vilmar. Morley ends up shooting Vilmar,
    wounding him. Could a prosecutor in this case charge Morley with
    attempted murder? What is the mens rea issue here?

3.  Another hypothetical. Consider the circumstances in [People v.
    Thomas](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=Y&pubNum=0000661&sernum=1986161584&__lrTS=20200725175040077&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&bhcp=1&CobaltRefresh=65892): 

A woman (A)  tells her boyfriend (B)  that the man (C), who lives one
floor above them, assaulted her. B goes to C's apartment and confronts
him with a gun, which culminates in C getting shot. 

What must the state establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, to secure B's
conviction for attempt murder? What result if B testifies that he only
intended to scare C? What result if B's gun misfired as he was
threatening C?

4.  Model Penal Code. [MPC
    §5.01](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.01&__lrTS=20200725175603501&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29)
    is relatively vague, but can be better understood upon a bit of
    dissection. In order to properly apply this standard, one must first
    determine whether the case involves a complete or incomplete
    attempt. If the facts point to a complete attempt, one must
    establish whether the target offense is a "result" crime or a
    "conduct" crime. A "result" crime typically has a result evidencing
    the crime (i.e. a dead body after a murder), whereas a "conduct"
    crime is one in which the attendant circumstances make it criminal
    (i.e. drinking and driving). 

When analyzing the MPC, subsection 1(a) should be applied to a completed
attempt involving a "conduct" crime, whereas subsection 1(b) should be
applied to a completed attempt of a "result" crime. If the crime
involves an incomplete attempt, then subsection 1(c) should be applied
in tandem with subsection 2, which further develops the meaning of a
"substantial step."

5.  Problem. Rahela wants to shoot a gun at some targets in her
    backyard. She knows that her neighbors are having a large gathering
    just behind where she set up her targets. She also knows that she
    could potentially kill her neighbors' guests, should she miss her
    target. Fortunately, no one was injured after she fired several
    rounds. 

Take a look at the California [homicide
statute](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&division=&title=8.&part=1.&chapter=1.&article=)
and the [attempt
statute](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=664.).
Is Rahela guilty of attempted murder? What about under [MPC
§5.01](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.01&__lrTS=20200725191721919&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&bhcp=1&CobaltRefresh=18212)?

Argued before MURPHY, C.J., and ELDRIDGE, COLE, RODOWSKY, McAULIFFE,
ADKINS and BLACKWELL, JJ.

MURPHY, Chief Judge.

The question presented is whether "attempted felony murder" is a crime
in this State.

I.

On December 2, 1986, three men entered Barry Tensor's shoe store. One
man, later identified as Leon Bruce, was masked and armed with a
handgun. He ordered Tensor to open the cash register. One of Bruce's
confederates jumped over the counter, and emptied the drawer of its
money. Tensor was then ordered to open a second register. Upon finding
it empty, Bruce demanded to know where the money could be found. Tensor
testified:

> "I said it's empty, that is all there is and then he took the gun and
> aimed it right at my face, at my head. And he said I'm going to kill
> you in a very serious voice, and the gun was continuously held right
> at my face.
>
> "At that point, I was incredibly afraid and I just tucked my head down
> and kind of tried to get out of the way and ducked down and moved
> forward. And at that point, I guess I banged into him or something and
> he shot me."

Tensor was hospitalized for five weeks from a gunshot wound to his
stomach.

On March 10, 1987, Bruce was charged by criminal information with
attempted first degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and two
counts of unlawful use of a handgun. A jury in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City found him not guilty of attempted first degree
premeditated murder, guilty of attempted first degree felony murder,
guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon, and guilty of the two handgun
charges. The presiding judge (Noel, J.) subsequently granted Bruce's
motion for a new trial on all charges. He concluded that his jury
instructions pertaining to attempted felony murder were erroneous
because no such offense existed under Maryland law.

Bruce was tried a second time before a jury in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City (Ross, J., presiding). Again, he was found guilty of
attempted felony murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and upon the two
handgun violations. For the attempted felony murder conviction, Bruce
was sentenced to a life term to run consecutively to all outstanding
sentences, and to twenty years- for using a handgun in the commission of
a crime of violence. Bruce's other handgun conviction, as well as that
for armed robbery, was merged into the attempted felony murder
conviction.

On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Bruce argued that attempted
felony murder was not a crime in Maryland. We granted certiorari prior
to decision by the intermediate appellate court to consider the
significant issue raised in the case.

II\.

Maryland Code (1982 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, § 407 provides that murder
"perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, or by any kind of
wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing shall be murder in the first
degree." Section 410---the so-called felony murder statute---provides
that all murder committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to
perpetrate, certain designated felonies, of which robbery is one, is
also murder in the first degree. These statutes do not create new
statutory crimes but rather divide the common law crime of murder into
degrees for purposes of punishment. *See Hook v. State,* 315 Md. 25, 28,
553 A.2d 233 (1989); *Campbell v. State,* 293 Md. 438, 441, 444 A.2d
1034 (1982); *Wood v. State,* 191 Md. 658, 666, 62 A.2d 576 (1948).

We observed in *Veney v. State,* 251 Md. 159, 174, 246 A.2d 608 (1968),
*cert. denied,* 394 U.S. 948, 89 S.Ct. 1284, 22 L.Ed.2d 482 (1969), that
at common law "a killing in the perpetration of a robbery was murder,
regardless of intent." *See also Stansbury v. State,* 218 Md. 255, 260,
146 A.2d 17 (1958); Clark and Marshall, *Crimes* § 245 (4th ed. 1940).
To secure a conviction for first degree murder under the felony murder
doctrine, the State is required to prove a specific intent to commit the
underlying felony and that death occurred in the perpetration or attempt
to perpetrate the felony; it is not necessary to prove a specific intent
to kill or to demonstrate the existence of wilfulness, deliberation, or
premeditation. *Hook v. State, supra,* 315 Md. at 31, 553 A.2d 233;
*State v. Frye,* 283 Md. 709, 712-13, 393 A.2d 1372 (1978); *Newton v.
State,* 280 Md. 260, 269, 373 A.2d 262 (1977); *Thompson v. State,* 230
Md. 113, 117, 186 A.2d 461 (1962); *Thomas v. State,* 206 Md. 575,
581-82, 112 A.2d 913 (1954). As we said in *Jackson v. State,* 286 Md.
430, 435, 408 A.2d 711 (1979), "homicide arising in the perpetration of,
or in the attempt to perpetrate, a felony is murder whether death was
intended or not, the fact that the person was engaged in such
perpetration or attempt being sufficient to supply the element of
malice."

III\.

In determining whether attempted felony murder is a crime in Maryland,
we note that criminal attempts are common law misdemeanors in Maryland,
applicable to any existing crime, whether statutory or common law. *Cox
v. State,* 311 Md. 326, 329-30, 534 A.2d 1333 (1988); *Young v.*
*State,* 303 Md. 298, 301, 493 A.2d 352 (1985); *Hardy v. State,* 301
Md. 124, 139, 482 A.2d 474 (1984). Under Maryland law, a criminal
attempt consists of a specific intent to commit the offense coupled with
some overt act in furtherance of the intent which goes beyond mere
preparation. *Cox, supra,* 311 Md. at 330, 534 A.2d 1333 and cases there
cited.

In *Cox,* the question presented was whether an individual could be
convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter. Recognizing that criminal
attempt is a specific intent crime, we held that an individual may be
convicted of the crime of attempted voluntary manslaughter since the
substantive offense is "an *intentional* homicide, done in a sudden heat
of passion, caused by adequate provocation." *Id.* at 331, 534 A.2d 1333
(emphasis in original). On the other hand, we noted that involuntary
manslaughter is an *"unintentional* killing done without malice, by
doing some unlawful act endangering life, or in negligently doing some
act lawful in itself"; accordingly, we held that it may not form the
basis of a criminal conviction for attempt. *Id.* at 332, 534 A.2d 1333
(emphasis in original).

IV\.

The elements of wilful, deliberate and premeditated attempted murder in
the first degree are the intent to commit the offense and some overt act
towards its commission. *State v. Holmes,* 310 Md. 260, 271-72, 528 A.2d
1279 (1987). In that case, we distinguished this species of first degree
murder from murder committed in the perpetration of one of the felonies
enumerated in the felony murder statute. As we said earlier, the
criminal intent requisite to proving a felony murder is the specific
intent to commit the underlying felony. Because a conviction for felony
murder requires no specific intent to kill, it follows that because a
criminal attempt is a specific intent crime, attempted felony murder is
not a crime in Maryland.

The majority of jurisdictions which have considered the question have
concluded that "attempted felony murder" is not a crime. *See, e.g.,
People v. Franklyn,* 157 Cal.App.3d 518, 203 Cal.Rptr. 813, 824 (1984);

State,* 443 N.E.2d 44, 51 (Ind.1982); *State v. Darby,* 200 NJ.Super.

Maestas,* 652 P.2d 903, 904 (Utah 1982).

In *People v. Viser, supra,* 343 N.E.2d at 910, the Supreme Court of
Illinois said:

"There can be no felony murder where there has been no death, and the
felony murder ingredient of the offense of murder cannot be made the
basis of an indictment charging attempted murder. Moreover, the offense
of attempt requires an 'intent to commit a specific offense', while the
distinctive characteristic of felony murder is that it does not involve
an intention to kill. There is no such criminal offense as an attempt to
achieve an unintended result." (Citations omitted.)

Similarly, the Supreme Court of Indiana flatly concluded that "absent
death the applicability of the felony murder rule is never triggered."
*Head v. State, supra,* 443 N.E.2d at 50. The Court of Appeals of New
Mexico, noting the absence of a mens rea (an intent to kill) in a felony
murder prosecution, has held that even when a specific intent to kill is
established, the felony murder rule is not applicable to an attempted
murder. *State v. Price, supra.* And the court in *State v. Darby,
supra,* 491 A.2d at 736, bluntly stated that "the purported crime of
attempted felony murder is manifestly unintelligible\_\_\_\_ The fact is
that the concepts of attempt and felony murder cannot rationally be
joined."

These holdings are fully in accord with the rationale advanced by LeFave
& Scott, *Criminal Law,* § 6.2 at 500 (2nd ed. 1986):

> "Some crimes, such as murder, are defined in terms of acts causing a
> particular result plus some mental state which need not be an intent
> to bring about that result. Thus, if A, B, C, and D have each taken
> the life of another, A acting with the intent to kill, B with an
> intent to do serious bodily injury, C with a reckless disregard of
> human life, and D in the course of a dangerous felony, all three are
> guilty of murder because the crime of murder is defined in such a way
> that any one of these mental states will suffice. However, if the
> victims do not die from their injuries, then only A is guilty of
> attempted murder; on a charge of attempted murder it is not sufficient
> to show that the defendant intended to do serious bodily harm, that he
> acted in reckless disregard for human life, or that he was committing
> a dangerous felony. Again, this is because intent is needed for the
> crime of attempt, so that attempted murder requires an intent to bring
> about that result described by the crime of murder (i.e., the death of
> another)."

Reaching a contrary result is *Amlotte v. State,* 456 So.2d 448
(Fla.1984) (attempted felony murder is a valid crime). *See also White
v. State,* 266 Ark. 499, 585 S.W.2d 952, 954 (1979) (recognizing the
existence of attempted felony murder under that state's statutory
definition of attempt, but noting a distinction from precode cases).

The State maintains that because the evidence in the case sufficiently
supported a finding that Bruce harbored a specific intent to kill
Tensor, the crime of attempted felony murder was necessarily
established. But, as we have said, the criminal intent necessary to
convict for attempted murder requires, as one of its essential elements,
a specific intent to kill. Consequently, as Maryland does not recognize
attempted felony murder as a crime, Bruce's conviction for committing
that non-existent offense must be reversed. Bruce's convictions for
armed robbery, as well as the handgun violations, are unaffected by our
holding in this case. Since the court merged the armed robbery
conviction into the now vacated conviction for attempted felony murder,
we shall remand the case for sentencing on the armed robbery count.

AS TO THE CONVICTION OF ATTEMPTED FELONY MURDER: JUDGMENT REVERSED; AS
TO THE CONVICTION FOR ARMED ROBBERY: CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT
FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR IMPOSITION OF SENTENCE ON THE ARMED ROBBERY
COUNT; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.

McAULIFFE, Judge,

dissenting.

The jury in this case found that Leon Bruce, in the course of committing
a robbery, shot Barry Tensor in the chest with the specific intent to
kill him. Had Tensor died, Bruce would have been guilty of murder in the
first degree. *Ross v.* State, 308 Md. 337, 341-42, 519 A.2d 735 (1987).
The fact that Tensor did not die does not absolve Bruce of liability for
his dangerous and deadly action. Rather, it changes the nature of the
offense from murder in the first degree to attempted murder in the first
degree.

There are complications inherent in applying the law of attempt to the
concept of felony murder. By mechanical application of established
principles, one might, in a facially logical manner, reach the result
that every assault committed in the course of an enumerated felony is
punishable as an attempted first degree murder. The rationale for that
result is that if the victim had died, the result would be first degree
murder, and because the defendant had taken every step necessary to
commit such a crime, the failure of the victim to die should operate
only to change the crime to an attempt. The majority properly rejects
that possibility. Our cases have consistently held that proof of an
attempt requires proof of a specific intent to commit the underlying
crime. *See, e.g., Cox v. State,* 311 Md. 326, 330, 534 A.2d 1333
(1988); *Young v. State,* 303 Md. 298, 302-03, 493 A.2d 352 (1985). That
portion of the felony murder concept which obviates the need for a
specific intent to kill cannot logically be transplanted into the law of
attempt.

No such abstruse application of the law is suggested by this case. Here,
the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that in order to find the
defendant guilty of attempted murder, they were required to find that
Bruce harbored a specific intent to kill Tensor at the time he shot
him.[^48] The relevant instructions given were: That instruction is in
accordance with our statement in *Young v. State,* 308 Md. 298, 311, 493
A.2d 352 (1985) that:

> In order for one to be guilty of attempted murder in the first degree,
> three things must be shown: it must be shown that the person intended
> to kill the victim without excuse or justification or circumstances of
> mitigation. It has to be a specific intent to kill the victim without
> excuse, without justification, and without circumstances of
> mitigation. That's the first thing.
>
> Then it must be shown that that---that a substantial step was taken
> toward the commission of that crime. A substantial step toward
> intentionally killing that human being.
>
> And third, in order for it to be attempted murder in the first degree,
> that intent and that substantial step or act toward the commission
> must occur during the course of the commission of the crime of robbery
> or robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon.
>
> Those are the three elements that must be proved in order for there to
> be guilt of attempted murder in the first degree. A specific intent to
> kill the victim without excuse or justification, a substantial step
> toward the commission, toward carrying out that intent, and both the
> intent and the substantial step or act must occur during the course of
> the commission of the crime of robbery or robbery with a dangerous or
> deadly weapon.
>
> A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent
> to commit a crime, he engages in conduct which constitutes a
> substantial step toward the commission of that crime whether or not
> his intention be accomplished.

Accepting, as I have, and as the trial judge did below, the premise that
a specific intent to kill is a necessary element in any attempted
murder, the sole remaining question is whether the fact that the murder
was attempted during the perpetration, or attempted perpetration, of an
enumerated felony operates to make it an attempted murder in the first
degree. History and logic compel the conclusion that it does.

At common law, all murder was punishable by death. In 1809, in
recognition of the fact that the several forms of murder varied greatly
in degree of atrociousness, and with an express desire to match the
penalty to the seriousness of the offense, our legislature divided
murder into degrees. *Ross v. State, supra,* 308 Md. at 340-41, 519 A.2d
735; *Hardy v. State,* 301 Md. 124, 137, 482 A.2d 474 (1984). The
legislature considered the following circumstances sufficiently
egregious to warrant inclusion of the offense within the highest degree:
murder perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or any kind
of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or committed in the
perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, certain enumerated felonies.
*Ross, supra,* 308 Md. at 341, 519 A.2d 735. All other murder was murder
in the second degree. No significant change in the treatment of this
aspect of the law of murder has been made in the intervening 180 years.
*See* Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, §§ 407-411.

It is entirely logical to conclude that an attempted murder committed
under the aggravating circumstances singled out by the legislature
should be treated as an attempted murder in the first degree. Certainly
this is true of attempted premeditated murder. *Hardy, supra,* 301 Md.
at 137, 482 A.2d 474. It should be no less true of an attempted murder
committed during the perpetration of an enumerated felony, provided that
there exists a specific intent to kill. This portion of the concept of
felony murder, embracing as it does the clear intent of the legislature,
translates very nicely into the law of attempts. As Judge Cole wrote for
the Court in *Hardy, supra,* 301 Md. at 139-40, 482 A.2d 474:

> If the evidence satisfies the fact finder by proof beyond a reasonable
> doubt that the conduct of the defendant falls within the proscribed
> conduct in the statute labeled as first degree murder that did not
> result in death of the victim, then the crime of attempted murder in
> the first degree has been established. If the evidence of criminal
> culpability is something less, the crime proved may be attempted
> murder in the second degree or attempted voluntary manslaughter. We
> emphasize that the basic characteristic of an attempt is that it
> adjusts according to the proof established at trial.

I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.

Notes and Questions - Bruce v. State

 

1.  Florida: Perpetually an outlier. Most states agree with the Bruce
    analysis, with the exception of Florida. The [attempted felony
    murder
    statute](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1000006&cite=FLSTS782.051&__lrTS=20200725193048746&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29)
    in Florida indicates that "\[a\]ny person who perpetrates or
    attempts to perpetrate any \[enumerated\] felony \* \* \* and who
    commits, aids, or abets an intentional act that is not an essential
    element of the felony and that could, but does not, cause the death
    of another," is guilty of a "felony of the first degree."

Keeping in mind that home invasion robbery is an enumerated felony under
the aforementioned statute, consider the following scenario: 

Hans decides he wants to break into a home with the intention of
stealing the television inside. In the process of checking windows and
doors for an easy way inside, he changes his mind and leaves the house.
Is Hans guilty of attempted home invasion robbery? 

2.  MPC and attendant circumstances. Here is how the Model Penal Code
    considers the attendant circumstances surrounding an attempt: 

The requirement of purpose extends to the conduct of the actor and to
the results that his conduct causes, but his purpose need not encompass
all of the circumstances included in the formal definition of the
substantive offense. As to them, it is sufficient that he acts with the
culpability that is required for commission of the completed crime.

\* \* \* The judgment is thus that if the defendant manifests a purpose
to engage in the type of conduct or to cause the type of result that is
forbidden by the criminal law \[in the form of strict liability\], he
has sufficiently exhibited his dangerousness to justify the imposition
of criminal sanctions, so long as he otherwise acts with the kind of
culpability that is sufficient for the completed offense. The objective
is to select out those elements of the completed crime that, if the
defendant desires to bring them about, indicate with clarity that he
poses the type of danger to society that the substantive offense is
designed to prevent. This objective is well served by the Code's
approach, followed in a number of recently enacted and proposed
revisions, of allowing the policy of the substantive offense to control
with respect to circumstance elements.

Attempt - Actus Reus

 

When considering actus reus in the context of attempt crimes, it is
useful to note the inherent challenge of line-drawing in these cases.
[John S. Strahorn,
Jr.](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4227&context=wlulr)
has noted that "\[b\]oth as fascinating and as fruitless as the
alchemists' quest for the philosopher's stone has been the search, by
judges and writers, for a valid, single statement of doctrine to express
when, under the law of guilt, preparations to commit a crime becomes a
criminal attempt thereat.\"

United States v. Mandujano

 

United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

499 F.2d 370

No. 74-1445

1974-08-19

**\[ ... \]**

RIVES, Circuit Judge:

Mandujano appeals from the judgment of conviction and fifteen-year
sentence imposed by the district court, based upon the jury's verdict
finding him guilty of attempted distribution of heroin in violation of
21 U.S.C. § 846.[^49] We affirm.

I.

The government's case rested almost entirely upon the testimony of
Alfonso H. Cavalier, Jr., a San Antonio police officer assigned to the
Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement. **\[ ... \]**At about 1:30 P. M.
on the afternoon of March 29, 1973\', pursuant to information Cavalier
had received, he and a government informer went to the Tally-Ho Lounge,
a bar located on Guadalupe Street in San Antonio. Once inside the bar,
the informant introduced Cavalier to Roy Mandujano. After some general
conversation, Mandujano asked the informant if he was looking for
"stuff." Cavalier said, "Yes." Mandujano then questioned Cavalier about
his involvement in narcotics. Cavalier answered Mandujano's questions,
and told Mandujano he was looking for an ounce sample of heroin to
determine the quality of the material. Mandujano replied that he had
good brown Mexican heroin for \$650.00 an ounce, but that if Cavalier
wanted any of it he would have to wait until later in the afternoon when
the regular man made his deliveries. Cavalier said that he was from out
of town and did not want to wait that long. Mandujano offered to locate
another source, and made four telephone calls in an apparent effort to
do so. The phone calls appeared to be unsuccessful, for Mandujano told
Cavalier he wasn't having any luck contacting anybody. Cavalier stated
that he could not wait any longer. Then Mandujano said he had a good
contact, a man who kept narcotics around his home, but that if he went
to see this man, he would need the money "out front." To reassure
Cavalier that he would not simply abscond with the money, Mandujano
stated, "\[Y\]ou are in my place of business. My wife is here. You can
sit with my wife. I am not going to jeopardize her or my business for
\$650.00." Cavalier counted out \$650.00 to Mandujano, and Mandujano
left the premises of the Tally-Ho Lounge at about 3:30 P.M. About an
hour later, he returned and explained that he had been unable to locate
his contact. He gave back the \$650.00 and told Cavalier he could still
wait until the regular man came around. Cavalier left, but arranged to
call back at 6:00 P.M. When Cavalier called at 6:00 and again at 6:30,
he was told that Mandujano was not available. Cavalier testified that he
did not later attempt to contact Mandujano, because, "Based on the
information that I had received, it would be unsafe for either my
informant or myself to return to this area."

The only other government witness was Gerald Courtney, a Special Agent
for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Agent Courtney testified that,
as part of a surveillance team in the vicinity of the Tally-Ho Lounge on
March 29, 1973, he had observed Mandujano leave the bar around 3:15 or
3:30 P.M. and drive off in his automobile. The surveillance team
followed Mandujano but lost him almost immediately in heavy traffic.
Courtney testified that Mandujano returned to the bar at about 4:30 P.M.

II\.

Section 846 of Title 21, entitled "Attempt and conspiracy," provides
that,

> "Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in
> this subchapter is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which
> may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the
> commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy."

The theory of the government in this case is straightforward:
Mandujano's acts constituted an attempt to distribute heroin; actual
distribution of heroin would violate section 841(a)(1) of Title 21;
[^50] therefore, Mandujano's attempt to distribute heroin comes within
the terms of section 846 as an attempt to commit an offense defined in
the subchapter.

Mandujano urges that his conduct as described by agent Cavalier did not
rise to the level of an attempt to distribute heroin under section 846.
He claims that at most he was attempting to acquire a controlled
substance, not to distribute it; that it is impossible for a person to
attempt to distribute heroin which he does not possess or control; [^51]
that his acts were only preparation, as distinguished from an attempt;
and that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict.

Apparently there is no legislative history indicating exactly what
Congress meant when it used the word "attempt" in section 846.[^52]
There are two reported federal cases which discuss the question of what
constitutes an attempt under this section. In United States v. Noreikis,
7 Cir. 1973, 481 F.2d 1177, where the defendants possessed the various
chemicals necessary to synthesize Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a controlled
substance, the court held that the preparations had progressed to the
level of an attempt to manufacture a controlled substance. In its
discussion, the court commented that,

> "While it seems to be well settled that mere preparation is not
> sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit a crime, 22 C.J.S.
> Criminal Law § 75(2)b, at 230 et seq., it seems equally clear that the
> semantical distinction between preparation and attempt is one
> incapable of being formulated in a hard and fast rule. The procuring
> of the instrument of the crime might be preparation in one factual
> situation and not in another. The matter is sometimes equated with the
> commission of an overt act, the 'doing something directly moving
> toward, and bringing him nearer, the crime he intends to commit.' 22
> C.J.S., *supra* at 231."

481 F.2d at 1181.

In United States v. Heng Awkak Roman, S.D.N.Y.1973, 356 F.Supp. 434,
aff'd, 2 Cir. 1973, 484 F.2d 1271, where the defendants' actions would
have constituted possession of heroin with intent to distribute in
violation of section 841 if federal agents had not substituted soap
powder for the heroin involved in the case, the court held that the
defendants' acts were an attempt to possess with intent to distribute.
The district court in its opinion acknowledged that " 'Attempt,' as used
in section 846, is not defined. Indeed, there is no comprehensive
statutory definition of attempt in federal law." The court concluded,
however, that it was not necessary in the circumstances of the case to
deal with the "complex question of when conduct crosses the line between
'mere preparation' and 'attempt.' " 356 F.Supp. at 437.

The courts in many jurisdictions have tried to elaborate on the
distinction between mere preparation and attempt. See the Comment at
39-48 of Tent. Draft No. 10, 1960 of the Model Penal Code.[^53] In cases
involving statutes other than section 846, the federal courts have
confronted this issue on a number of occasions.

**\[ ... \]**

In Lemke v. United States, 9 Cir. 1954, 211 F.2d 73, 75, 14 Alaska 587,
the court states, "Of course it is elementary that mere preparation to
commit a crime, not followed by an overt act done toward its commission,
does not constitute an attempt." The definition of attempt in United
States v. Baker, S.D.Cal.1955, 129 F.Supp. 684, 685, is also consistent
with the language of Wooldridge: "The classical legal elements of an
'attempt' are the *intent* to commit a crime, the execution of some
overt *act* in pursuance of the intention, and a *failure to consummate*
the crime." Also see Giles v. United States, 9 Cir. 1946, 157 F.2d 588,
590, where the court found no error in the following jury instruction: "
'An attempt is an act tending toward the accomplishment, and done in
part execution of the design to commit a crime, exceeding an intent but
falling short of an execution of it.' "

**\[ ... \]**

In United States v. Coplon, 2 Cir. 1950, 185 F.2d 629, where the
defendant was arrested before passing to a citizen of a foreign nation
classified government documents contained in defendant's purse, Judge
Learned Hand surveyed the law and addressed th.e issue of what would
constitute an attempt:

> "Because the arrest in this way interrupted the consummation of the
> crime one point upon the appeal is that her conduct still remained in
> the zone of 'preparation,' and that the evidence did not prove an
> 'attempt.' **\[ ... \]**A neat doctrine by which to test when a
> person, intending to commit a crime which he fails to carry out, has
> 'attempted' to commit it, would be that he has done all that it is
> within his power to do, but has been prevented by intervention from
> outside; **\[ ... \]**In the second of the Massachusetts opinions
> Holmes, J., said: "Preparation is not an attempt. But some
> preparations may amount to an attempt. It is a question of degree.**\[
> ... \]**

In United States v. Robles, N.D.Cal.1960, 185 F.Supp. 82, 85, a case in
which the defendant was charged with using communication facilities in
attempting to import heroin illegally, the court enunciated the
following test:

> "The language of Title 18 U.S.C. § 1403 is such as to compel a
> conclusion that an attempt may be made by the mere use of
> communication facilities. To attempt to do an act does not imply a
> completion of the act, or in fact any definite progress towards it.
> Any effort or endeavor to effect the act will satisfy the terms of the
> law. **\[ ... \]**

The language used in *Robles, supra,* is drawn directly from United
States v. Quincy, **\[ ... \]**The Supreme Court in *Quincy* further
stated that, "The offence consists principally in the intention with
which the preparations were made \.... And this must be a fixed
intention \.... This intention is a question belonging exclusively to
the jury to decide It is the material point on which the legality of
criminality of the act must turn." 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 466, 8 L.Ed. 458.

**\[ ... \]**

Although the foregoing cases give somewhat varying verbal formulations,
careful examination reveals fundamental agreement about what conduct
will constitute a criminal attempt. First, the defendant must have been
acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the crime which he is charged with attempting. United
States v Quincy, *supra,* 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 466, 8 L.Ed. 458 ("The
offence consists principally in the intention with which the
preparations were made"); Wooldridge v. United States, *supra,* 237 F.
at 779 ("although it may have been his intention"); United States v.
Baker, *supra,* 129 F.Supp. at 685 ("the *intent* to commit a crime");
Giles v. United States, *supra,* 157 F.2d at 590 ("the design to commit
a crime"); **\[ ... \]** United States v. Noreikis, *supra,* 481 F.2d at
1181 (" 'the crime he *intends* to commit' " \[emphasis added\]); United
States v. Heng Awkak Roman, *supra,* 356 F.Supp at 437 n. 5 ("There is
no doubt here, and I so find, that the defendants had the requisite mens
rea; that is, that their actions were knowing and intentional, and with
the purpose of distributing the heroin."); People v. Buffum, *supra*
("the will of the attempter").

Second, the defendant must have engaged in conduct which constitutes a
substantial step toward commission of the crime. A substantial step must
be conduct strongly corroborative of the firmness of the defendant's
criminal intent. Wooldridge v. United States, *supra,* 237 F. at 779
("an overt act toward the commission of the crime charged"); Lemke v.
United States, *supra,* 211 F.2d at 75 ("an overt act done toward its
\[the crime's\] commission"); United States v. Baker, *supra* ("some
overt act in pursuance of the intention") ; Giles v. United States,
*supra* ("an act tending toward the accomplishment, and done in part
execution of the design to commit a crime"); Gregg v. United States,
*supra,* 113 F.2d at 690 ("a step in the direct movement towards the
commission of the crime after preparations have been made"); United
States v. Coplon, *supra,* 185 F.2d at 633 ("there are many decisions
which hold that the accused has passed beyond 'preparation,' although he
has been interrupted before he has taken the last of his intended steps
. . . there is, and obviously can be, no definite line"); United States
v. Robles, *supra* 185 F.Supp. at 85 ("Any effort or endeavor to effect
the act"); United States v. *Noreikis, supra* 481 F.2d at 1181 ("the
commission of an overt act, the 'doing something directly moving toward,
and bringing him nearer, the crime he intends to commit' "); People v.
Buffum, *supra,* 256 P.2d at 321 ("there must be some *appreciable
fragment* of the crime committed \.... the act must not be equivocal in
nature"). The use of the word "conduct" indicates that omission or
possession, as well as positive acts, may in certain cases provide a
basis for liability. The phrase "substantial step," rather than "overt
act," is suggested by Gregg v. United States, *supra* ("a step in the
direct movement toward the commission of the crime"); United States v.
Coplon, *supra* ("before he has taken the last of his intended steps")
and People v. Buffum, *supra* ("some *appreciable fragment* of the
crime") and indicates that the conduct must be more than remote
preparation. The requirement that the conduct be strongly corroborative
of the firmness of the defendant's criminal intent also relates to the
requirement that the conduct be more than "mere preparation," and is
suggested by the Supreme Court's emphasis upon ascertaining the intent
of the defendant, United States v. Quincy, *supra,* and by the approach
taken in United States v. Coplon, *supra* 185 F.2d at 633 (". . . some
preparation may amount to an attempt. It is a question of degree").[^54]

The evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of guilty under section
846. Agent Cavalier testified that at Mandujano's request, he gave him
\$650.-00 for one ounce of heroin, which Mandujano said he could get
from a "good contact." From this, plus Mandujano's comments and conduct
before and after the transfer of the \$650.00, as described in Part I of
this opinion, the jury could have found that Mandujano was acting
knowingly and intentionally and that he engaged in conduct --- the
request for and the receipt of the \$650.00 --- which in fact
constituted a substantial step toward distribution of heroin. **\[ ...

Notes and Questions - United States v. Mandujano

 

The footnotes of Mandujano summarize the comments to the Model Penal
Code, which develops several formulae regarding where to draw the line
in attempt law:

1.  The physical proximity doctrine - the overt act required for an
    attempt must be proximate to the completed crime, or directly
    tending toward the completion of the crime, or must amount to the
    commencement of the consummation.

2.  The dangerous proximity doctrine - a test given impetus by Mr.
    Justice Holmes whereby the greater the gravity and probability of
    the offense, and the nearer the act to the crime, the stronger is
    the case for calling the act an attempt.

3.  The indispensable element test - a variation of the proximity tests
    which emphasizes any indispensable aspect of the criminal endeavor
    over which the actor has not yet acquired control.

4.  The probable desistance test - the conduct constitutes an attempt
    if, in the ordinary and natural course of events, without
    interruption from an outside source, it will result in the crime
    intended. \* \* \*

5.  The res ipsa loquitur or unequivocality test - an attempt is
    committed when the actor's conduct manifests an intent to commit a
    crime.

The line between preparation and perpetration is particularly pertinent
to the crime of attempt, as it provides a distinction as to when a crime
occurred. However, the demarcation of this line is largely left to the
court's discretion. Here are a few examples of cases and articles where
the conversation surrounding the application of attempt law varies:

1.  [People v. Superior Court

    170 Cal. App. 4th 535, 540, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 781, 784--85 (2009):

"In considering appellant\'s argument, we first note that in a case such
as this one '\[w\]here the intent to commit the crime is clearly shown,
an act done toward the commission of the crime may be sufficient for an
attempt even though that same act would be insufficient if the intent is
not as clearly shown.' \* \* \* '\[T\]he plainer the intent to commit
the offense, the more likely that steps in the early stages of the
commission of the crime will satisfy the overt act requirement.' \* \*
\* Thus, even " 'slight acts done in furtherance of that design will
constitute an attempt, and the courts should not destroy the practical
and common-sense administration of the law with subtleties as to what
constitutes preparation and what constitutes an act done toward the
commission of a crime.'"

appreciable fragment of the crime must have been accomplished, i.e., it
must be in such progress that it will be consummated unless interrupted
by circumstances independent of the will of the attempter. \* \* \*
Accordingly, in order to constitute an attempt it must not only appear
that the defendant had a specific intent to commit a crime but also that
he did a direct unequivocal act toward that end."

"Cases arising along the preparation-attempt spectrum are handled in
terms of their similarities to and differences from the substantive
crime attempted, and in terms of analogy to previously decided or
hypothetical attempt cases. In deciding, the court weighs several
factors, principally: whether the act at issue is sufficiently close to
the substantive crime or close enough to potential irreparable harm so
as to preclude any further postponement of official intervention;
whether the defendant\'s conduct has progressed to the point that one
may be reasonably certain that he is firmly committed to a specific
illegal venture rather than merely contemplating the possible future
commission of a crime; and whether the act is sufficiently unambiguous
to demonstrate the actor\'s illegal intent."

November 7, 1900.

Present: Holmes, C. J., Knowlton, Morton, Lathrop, Barker, Hammond, &
Loring, JJ.

In a prosecution under Pub. Sts. c. 210, § 8, providing that *"* whoever
attempts to commit an offence prohibited by law, and in such an attempt
does any act towards the commission of such offence," shall be punished
as therein provided, where the offence alleged is an attempt to set fire
to property with the intention of injuring the insurers thereof, in
violation of Pub. Sts. c. 208, § 7, and the ease is to be made out by
showing a preparation in a certain room of inflammable materials and a
solicitation of some one else to set the fire, an indictment drawn under
St. 1899, c. 409, must allege such solicitation as one of the overt
acts, and if not so alleged it cannot be relied upon as an overt act. ,

In a trial under Pub. Sts. c. 210, § 8, for an attempt to set fire to
property witli the intention of injuring the insurers thereof, in
violation of Pub. Sts. c. 203, §7, there was evidence tiiat the
defendant, the owner of a building and its contents which were insured
at a high valuation, constructed and arranged combustibles in the
building in such a way that they were ready to be lighted, and if
lighted would have set fire to the building and its contents; that the
plan required a candle which was standing on a shelf six feet away to be
placed on a piece of wood in a pan of turpentine and lighted; that the
defendant offered to pay a man in his employ to go to the building and
carry out the plan; that the offer was refused; and that later the
defendant and his employee drove from a distance of some miles towards
the building, and when within a quarter of a mile of it the defendant
said that he had changed his mind and drove away. *Semble,* that under
an indictment properly drawn, the defendant upon this evidence might
have been convicted of an indictable offence, --- whether to be laid as
an attempt or as a solicitation, *quaere.*

Indictment, under Pub. Sts. c. 210, § 8, for an attempt to set fire to
property with the intention of injuring the insurers thereof, in
violation of Pub. Sts. c. 203, § 7. Trial in the Superior Court, before
*Pierce,* J.

The judge overruled a motion to quash the indictment; and the defendant
excepted.

At the conclusion of the testimony the defendant requested the judge to
instruct the jury that the whole evidence was not sufficient to support
the indictment, and that the jury would not be warranted in convicting
the defendant thereon. The judge declined to make these rulings; and the
defendant excepted. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.

The material portion of the evidence was, in substance, as follows. The
building in which the alleged attempt to set fire was committed was
situated at Beverly Farms. It was of three stories of wood upon a brick
basement. The defendant was engaged in the business of carriage painting
and repairing, and in such business occupied the basement and the first
floor, and kept the other two floors for his family dwelling-house. The
land and building were valued at about \$3,200, and were owned by the
defendant, but were mortgaged for \$3,000, and the insurance on the
building was payable to the mortgagee.

At the time alleged there was insurance upon the personal property and
household furniture in the building, in the companies named in the
indictment, and the evidence tended to show that the actual value of the
property on hand was much less than the insurance.

On Monday morning, July 3, 1899, the defendant took his wife and only
child to Gardiner, Maine.

One Ferguson, city marshal of Beverly, testified that in consequence of
information given to him during the afternoon of July 6, 1899, by one
Clark, a young man iiu the employ of the defendant, he and other
officers went to the above described premises at half past eleven
o'clock that night. That there was at this time, in a corner of the
varnish room, which was one of the rooms used by the defendant in
carrying on his business, an ordinary stove, used for heating the room
in cold weather. The fire pot contained paper and rubbish, which showed
no indication of fire. On the floor, near the stove, was a dish pan
containing turpentine; in the pan of turpentine was a block of wood, and
upon the block were small pieces of iron which held the top of the block
a little below the surface of the turpentine. Around and in close
proximity to the pan was a quantity of excelsior and wooden boxes, and
several unstopped tin cans, each containing four or five gallons of
turpentine. The excelsior on the floor, under and around the pan and for
some distance out from the stove, was more or less saturated with
turpentine. Upon a shelf, five or six feet away from the pan, on the
opposite side of a door, but in the same room, was a candle of the
thick, slow burning kind, ordinarily known and used as a coach candle.
This candle was fresh and showed no sign of use or of ignition.

Clark testified that he had worked for the defendant for several years;
that he was paid \$10 on Saturday, July 1,1899, by the defendant, for
his week's work; that the defendant told him that he need not come to
work again until Wednesday morning, July 5,1899; that at about half past
six in the morning of Wednesday, July 5, 1899, he was sent for to come
from his lodging in Beverly to a hotel in Beverly; that he went to the
hotel; that he was shown to a room, where ,he found the defendant; that
the defendant then told him, in substance, that his business was in a
bad way; that he was in debt, and that he had either got to stop or that
the place had got to go up; that he told him of the arrangement of the
pan of turpentine, excelsior, boxes, and candle as found by the city
marshal; that the defendant told him that the plan was to take the
candle from the shelf, put it upon the block of wood in the pan of
turpentine, ignite it, and leave it to burn down into the turpentine;
that the candle would burn three or four hours before igniting the
turpentine; that the defendant said the turpentine would eat the candle
; that the defendant offered him, first, \$25, then \$50, to go to the
building to do this, and that he refused to do so; that at the
defendant's request he did go to Beverly Farms on the morning train of
the same day, took the keys which the defendant gave him, entered the
building, looked into the varnish room and saw the arrangement; that he
did not notice the -candle, but did not pay particular attention; that
he and the defendant went to Salem in the evening; that in the railway
station in Salem the defendant asked him to get a team, meet the
defendant and drive him to Beverly Farms; that they drove to a certain
drinking-fountain, beyond which was the defendant's shop, about a
quarter of a mile; that neither got out; that the defendant there said
that he had changed his mind and turned the horse round and drove
immediately back to the station, where the defendant took a late train
for Boston.

Clark further testified that on Thursday, July 6, he went to the city
marshal and reported what had been done and said by him and by the
defendant during the previous day and evening ; that he accompanied the
marshal on the Thursday night visit of the latter to the defendant's
*premises;* that he then entered the varnish room, and that the
condition of tilings in the varnish room remained unchanged from the
condition which he saw on Wednesday morning.

The indictment contained three counts in which the material allegations
were the same, alleging an attempt wilfully to burn certain property
with the intent thereby to injure the insurer, and each concluding as
follows: " And in such attempt did collect, place, and put a certain
quantity of spirits of turpentine, a certain quantity of excelsior, and
a certain wax or tallow candle in said building, but did fail in the
perpetration of said attempted offence, against the peace of the
Commonwealth aforesaid, and contrary to the form of the statute in such
case made and provided." There was no allegation of solicitation of
another to light the collected materials or otherwise to take part in
the acts alleged.

The case was argued at the bar in November, 1900, and after-wards was
submitted on briefs to all the justices.

Holmes, C. J.

This is an indictment for an attempt to burn a building and certain
goods therein, with intent to injure the insurers of the same. Pub. Sts.
c. 210, § 8. The substantive offence alleged to have been attempted is
punished by Pub. Sts. c. 203, § 7. The defence is that the overt acts
alleged and proved do not amount to an offence. It was raised by a
motion to quash and also by a request to the judge to direct a verdict
for the defendant. We will consider the case in the first place upon the
evidence, apart from any question of pleading, and afterwards will take
it up in connection with the indictment as actually drawn.

The evidence was that the defendant had constructed and arranged
combustibles in the building in such a way that they were ready to be
lighted, and if lighted would have set fire to the building and its
contents. To be exact, the plan would have required a candle which was
standing on a shelf six feet away to be placed on a piece of wood in a
pan of turpentine and lighted. The defendant offered to pay a young man
in his employment if he would go to the building, seemingly some miles
from the place of the dialogue, and carry out the plan. This was
refused. Later the defendant and the young man drove toward the
building, but when within a quarter of a mile the defendant said that he
had changed his mind and drove away. This is as near as he ever came to
accomplishing what he had in contemplation.

The question on the evidence, more precisely stated, is whether the
defendant's acts come near enough to the accomplishment of the
substantive offence to be punishable. The statute does not punish every
act done toward the commission of a crime, but only such acts done in an
attempt to commit it. The most common types of an attempt are either an
act which is intended to bring about the substantive crime and which
sets in motion natural forces that would bring it about in the expected
course of events but for an unforeseen interruption, as in this case if
the candle had been set in its place and lighted but had been put out by
the police, or ah act which is intended to bring about the substantive
crime and would bring it about but.for a mistake of judgment in a matter
of nice estimate or experiment, as when a pistol is fired at a man but
misses him, or when one tries to pick a pocket which turns out to be
empty. In either case the would-be criminal has done his last act.

Obviously new considerations come in when further acts on the part of
the person who has taken the first steps are necessary before the
substantive crime can come to pass. In this class of cases there is
still a chance that the would-be criminal may change his mind. In
strictness, such first steps cannot be described as an attempt, because
that word suggests an act seemingly sufficient to accomplish the end,
and has been supposed to have no other meaning. *People* v. Murray, 14
Cal. 159, 160. That an overt act although coupled with an intent to
commit the crime commonly is not punishable if further acts are
contemplated as needful, is .expressed in the familiar rule that
preparation is not an attempt. But some preparations may amount to an
attempt. It is a question of degree. If the preparation comes very near
to the accomplish men t of the act, the intent to complete it renders
the crime so probable that the act will be a misdemeanor although there
is still a *locus penitentice* in the need of a further exertion of the
will to complete the crime. As was observed in a recent case, the degree
of proximity held sufficient may vary with circumstances, including
among other things the apprehension which the particular crime is
calculated to excite. *Commonwealth* v. Kennedy, 170 Mass. 18, 22. (See
also *Commonwealth* v. *Willard,* 22 Pick. 476.) A few instances of
liability of this sort are mentioned on the page cited.

As a further illustration, when the servant of a contractor had
delivered short rations of meat by the help of a false weight which he
had substituted for the true one, intending to steal the meat left over,
it was held by four judges, two of whom were Chief Justice Erie and Mr.
Justice Blackburn, that he could be convicted of an attempt to steal.
*Regina* v. Cheeseman, L. & C. 140; *S. C.* 10 W. R. 255. So lighting a
match with intent to set fire to a haystack, although the pi-isoner
desisted on discovering that he was watched. *Regina* v. Taylor, 1 F. &
F. 511. So getting into a stall with a poisoned potato, intending to
give it to a horse there, which the prisoner was prevented from doing by
his arrest. *Commonwealth* v. McLaughlin, 105 Mass. 460. See *Clark* v.
State, 86 Tenn. 511. So in this Commonwealth it was held criminal to let
a house to a woman of ill fame with intent that it should be used for
purposes of prostitution, although it would seem that the finding of
intent meant only knowledge of the intent of the lessee. *Commonwealth*
v. Harring*ton,* 3 Pick. 26. See *Commonwealth* v. *Willard,* 22 Pick.
476, 478. Compare *Brockway* v. *People,* 2 Hill, 558, 562. The same has
been held as to paying a man to burn a barn, whether well laid as an
attempt or more properly as soliciting to commit a felony.
*Commonwealth* v. *Flagg,* 135 Mass. 545, 549. *State* v. *Bowers,* 35
So. Car. 262. Compare *Regina* v. *Williams,* 1 C. & K. 589; *S. C.* 1
Denison, 39. *McDade* v. *People,* 29 Mich. 50, 56. *Stabler* v.
*Commonwealth,* 95 Penn. St. 318. *Hicks* v. *Commonwealth,* 86 Va. 223.

On the other hand, making up a false invoice at the place of exportation
with intent to defraud the revenue is not an offence if not followed up
by using it or attempting to use it. *United States* v. *Twenty-eight
Packages,* Gilpin, 306, 324. *United States* v. *Riddle,* 5 Cranch, 311.
So in *People* v. *Murray,* 14 Cal. 159, the defendant's elopement with
his niece and his requesting a third person to bring a magistrate to
perform the marriage ceremony, was held not to amount to an attempt to
contract the marriage. But the ground on which this last decision was
put clearly was too broad. And however it may be at common law, under a
statute like ours punishing one who attempts to commit a crime "and in
such attempt does any act towards the commission of such offence " (Pub.
Sts. c. 210, § 8,) it seems to be settled elsewhere that the defendant
could be convicted on evidence like the present. *People* v. *Bush,* 4
Hill, 133, 134. *McDermott* v. *People,* 5 Parker Cr. Rep. 102.
*Griffin* v. *State,* 26 Ga. 493. *State* v. *Hayes,* 78 Mo. 307, 316.
See *Commonwealth* v. *Willard,* 22 Pick. 476. *People* v. *Bush* is
distinguished in *Stabler* v. *Commonwealth* as a decision upon the
words quoted. 95 Penn. St. 322.

Under the cases last cited we assume that there was evidence of a crime
and perhaps of an attempt, --- the latter question we do not decide.
Nevertheless, on the pleadings a majority of the court is of opinion
that the exceptions must be sustained. A mere collection and preparation
of materials in a room for the purpose of setting fire to them,
unaccompanied by any present intent to set the fire, would be too
remote. If the accused intended to rely upon his own hands to the end,
he must be shown to have had a present intent to accomplish the crime
without much delay, and to have had this intent at a time and place
where he was able to carry it out. We are not aware of any carefully
considered case that has gone further than this. We assume without
deciding that that is the meaning of the indictment, and it would have
been proved if for instance the evidence had been that the defendant had
been frightened by the police as he was about to light the candle. On
the other hand, if the offence is to be made out by showing a
preparation of the room and a solicitation of some one else to set the
fire, which solicitation if successful would have been the defendant's
last act, the solicitation must be alleged as one of the overt acts. It
was admissible in evidence on the pleadings as they stood to show the
defendant's intent, but it could not be relied on as an overt act unless
set out. The necessity that the overt acts should be alleged has been
taken for granted in our practice and decisions, (see e. g.
*Commonwealth* v. *Sherman,* 105 Mass. 169; *Commonwealth* v.
*McLaughlin,* 105 Mass. 460, 463; *Commonwealth* v. *Shedd,* 140 Mass.

Notes and Questions - Commonwealth v. Peaslee

 

1.  In Peaslee, solicitation to perform a crime plays a pivotal role.
    Can solicitation of another person to commit a crime constitute an
    attempt to commit that crime? What does the court suggest in the
    Peaslee case?

2.  Changing the facts. Would Peaselee be guilty of attempt if his
    employee agreed to commit the crime, but turned away of his own
    volition just prior to striking the match?

3.  Recall Note 1 after Mandujano. Was Peaslee guilty of attempt under
    the "dangerous proximity doctrine?" What about under the "probable
    desistance test?"

Model Penal Code and Commentaries [§
5.01](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=L&docname=ULPNCOS5.01&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&fn=_top&findtype=L&vr=2.0&db=1002069&wbtoolsId=ULPNCOS5.01&HistoryType=F)
cmt. 5(d), at 324--25 (1985) is critical of the probable desistance
test. It states that:

"Probable Desistance Test. Oriented largely toward the dangerousness of
the actor's conduct \* \* \* \[t\]his test seemed to require a judgment
in each case that the actor had reached a point where it was unlikely
that he would have voluntarily desisted from his efforts to commit the
crime. But in cases applying this test no inquiry was made into the
personality of the particular offender before the court. Rather, the
question was whether anyone who went so far would stop short of the
final step.\* \* \*

Accepting for the time being the underlying assumption that probability
of desistance, or actual abandonment of the criminal endeavor, negatives
dangerousness sufficiently to warrant immunity from attempt liability,
this test still does not appear to provide a workable standard. Is there
an adequate empirical basis for predicting whether desistance is
probable at various points in various type of cases? \* \* \* \[I\]n
actual operation the probable desistance test is linked entirely to the
nearness of the actor's conduct to completion, this being the sole basis
of unsubstantiated judicial appraisals of the probabilities of
desistance. The test as applied appears to be little more than the
physical proximity approach."

4.  Hypothetical. Consider this hypothetical based on [State v.
    Henthorn, 218 Wis.2d 526, 581
    N.W.2d](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=Y&pubNum=0000595&sernum=1998081745&__lrTS=20200726163454781&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&bhcp=1&CobaltRefresh=66036):[ ](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=Y&db=0000595&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&serialnum=1998081745&fn=_top&findtype=Y&vr=2.0&wbtoolsId=1998081745&HistoryType=F)

Henthorn's doctor wrote her a prescription for 30 painkillers (codeine).
The doctor authorized one refill of the prescription, writing "1" on the
refill line. Prior to filling the prescription, Henthorn drew another
"1" on the refill line, so it appeared to authorize "11" refills. She
then took the prescription into a pharmacy, where the pharmacist noticed
that the refills went contrary to the law, which mandates that drugs
containing codeine can legally be refilled no more than five times in a
six-month period. The pharmacist called the doctor, who confirmed that
he only authorized one refill. The pharmacist then called the police and
Henthorn was prosecuted for attempted fraudulent acquisition of a
controlled substance.

Should Henthorn be convicted? Which of the different Mandujano tests
might change the outcome? 

5.  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., in [The Common
    Law](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2449/2449-h/2449-h.htm),
    characterized the doctrine of "dangerous proximity" as:

\[L\]ighting a match with intent to set fire to a haystack has been held
to amount to a criminal attempt to burn it, although the defendant blew
out the match on seeing that he was watched. \* \* \*

\* \* \* If a man starts from Boston to Cambridge for the purpose of
committing a murder when he gets there, but is stopped by the draw
\[bridge\] and goes home, he is no more punishable than if he had sat in
his chair and resolved to shoot somebody, but on second thoughts had
given up the notion. \* \* \*

Eminent judges have been puzzled where to draw the line, or even to
state the principle on which it should be drawn, between the two sets of
cases. But the principle is believed to be similar to that on which all
other lines are drawn by the law. Public policy, that is to say,
legislative considerations, are at the bottom of the matter; the
considerations being, in this case, the nearness of the danger, the
greatness of the harm, and the degree of apprehension felt.

Court of Appeals of New York.

Argued October 17, 1927.

Decided November 22, 1927.

**\[ ... \]**

CRANE, J.

The police of the city of New York did excellent work in this case by
preventing the commission of a serious crime. It is a great satisfaction
to realize that we have such wide­-awake guardians of our peace. **\[ ...
\]**Charles Rizzo, the defendant, appellant, with three others, **\[ ...
\]**planned to rob one Charles Rao of a, payroll valued at about
\$31,200 which he was to carry from the bank for the United Lathing
Company. These defendants, two of whom had firearms, started out in an
automobile, looking for Rao or the had the payroll on that day. Rizzo
claimed to be able to identify the man and was to point him out to the
others who were to do the actual holding up. . The four rode about in
their car looking for Rao. They went to the bank from which he was
supposed to get the money and to various buildings being constructed by
the United Lathing Company. At last they came to One Hundred and
Eightieth street and Morris Park avenue. By this time they were watched
and followed by two police officers. As Rizzo jumped out of the car and
ran into the building all- four were arrested. The defendant was taken
out from the building in which he was hiding. Neither Rao nor a man
named Previti, who was also supposed to carry a payroll, were at the
place at the time of the arrest. The defendants had not found or seen
the man they intended to rob; no person with a payroll was at any of the
places where they had stopped no one had been pointed out or identified
by Rizzo. The four \`men intended to rob the payroll man, whoever he
was; they were looking for him, but they had not seen or discovered him
up to the time they were arrested.

Does this constitute the crime of an attempt to commit robbery in the
first degree? The Penal Law, section 2, prescribes, An act, done with
intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its
commission, is \"an attempt to commit that crime\". The word tending is
very indefinite. **\[ ... \]**Tending means to exert activity in a
particular direction. Any act in preparation to commit a crime may be
said to have a tendency towards its accomplishment. The procuring of the
automobile, searching the streets looking for the desired victim, were
in reality acts tending toward the commission of the proposed crime. The
law, however, has recognized that many acts in the way of preparation
are too remote to constitute the crime of attempt. The line has been
drawn between those acts which are remote and those which are proximate
and near to the consummation. The law must be practical, and, therefore,
considers those acts only as tending to the commission of the crime
which are so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable
probability the crime itself would, have been committed but for timely
interference.\" **\[ ... \]**

The method of committing or attempting crime varies in each case so that
the difficulty, if any, is not with this rule of law regarding an
attempt, which is well understood, but with its application to the
facts. **\[ ... \]**

How shall we apply this rule of immediate nearness to this case? The
defendants were looking fort the payroll man to rob him of his money.
**\[ ... \]**Robbery is defined in section 2120 of the Penal Law as the
unlawful taking of personal property, from the person or in the presence
of another, against his will, by means of force, or violence, or fear of
injury, immediate or future, to his person; and it is made robbery in
the first degree by section 2124 when committed by a person aided by
accomplices actually present. To constitute the crime of- robbery the
money must have been taken from Rao by means of force or violence, or
through fear. The crime of attempt to commit robbery was committed if
these defendants did any act tending to the commission of this robbery.
Did the acts above describe come dangerously near to the taking of Rao's
property? Did the acts come so near the commission of robbery that there
was reasonable likelihood of its accomplishment but for the
interference? Rao was not found the defendants were still looking for
him; no attempt to rob him could be made, at least until he came in
sight; he was not in the building at One Hundred and Eightieth street
and Morris Park avenue. There was no man there with the payroll for the
United Lathing Company whom these defendants could rob. Apparently no
money had been drawn from the bank for the payroll by anybody at the
time of the arrest. In a word, these defendants had planned to commit a
crime and were looking around the city for an opportunity to commit it,
but the opportunity fortunately never came. Men would not be guilty of
an attempt at burglary if they had planned to break into a building and
were arrested while they were hunting about the streets for the building
not knowing where it was. Neither would a man be guilty of an attempt to
commit murder if he armed himself and started out to find the person
whom he had planned to kill but could not him. So here these defendants
were not guilty of an attempt to commit robbery in the first degree when
they had not found or reached the presence of the person they intended
to rob. (People v. Sullivan, 173 N. Y. 122, 135.)

For these reasons, the judgment of conviction of this defendant,
appellant, must be reversed and a new trial granted.\

Notes and Questions - People v. Rizzo

 

1.  Consider the following excerpt from Michael Fishman's [Defining
    Attempts: Mandujano's
    Error](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ide5806bd93fc11e598dc8b09b4f043e0/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad6ad3a000001738c3d51939dfe6c75%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIde5806bd93fc11e598dc8b09b4f043e0%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=a9e17be7425fbf46e788e67e245b501d&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=3&sessionScopeId=b299bbb21fcec18abee412f798a76648aeb576ccfd17a415c988e36d051fc258&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29):

"Courts should adopt a proximity approach to attempt if they believe the
purpose of punishing an attempt is "to prevent some harm which is
foreseen as likely to follow . . . under the circumstances." Proximity
approaches are well tailored to this purpose because they do not punish
a defendant "until the defendant has come dangerously close to
accomplishing the completed crime." If "the primary purpose of punishing
individuals is to neutralize dangerous individuals and not to deter
dangerous acts," however, the proximity approaches are poorly suited to
the task. Consider the defendants in Peaslee or Rizzo. From Peaslee and
Rizzo\'s actions, one can readily determine that they were "dangerous"
individuals. There is every reason to believe that both men would have
carried out their intended crimes had they not been intercepted by law
enforcement. The ability of such dangerous individuals to evade
conviction represents the greatest weakness of the proximity approach."

Do you agree with this criticism of the proximity approach? How does
"neutralizing dangerous individuals" differ from "deterring dangerous
acts" in the context of attempt law?

Utilizing the dangerous proximity analysis, how should the following
cases turn out?

State v. Reeves

 

Tennessee Supreme Court

916 S.W.2d 909

1996-02-26

**\[ ... \]**

OPINION

DROWOTA, Judge.

The defendant, Trade Reeves, appeals from the Court of Appeals'
affirmance of the trial court's order designating her a delinquent
child. The trial court's delinquency order, which was entered following
a jury trial, was based on the jury's finding that the defendant had
attempted to commit second degree murder --- a violation of Tenn.Code
Ann. § 39-12-101. The specific issue for our determination is whether
the defendant's actions constitute a "substantial step," under §
39-12\~101(a)(3), toward the commission of that crime. For the following
reasons, we hold that they do, and therefore affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals.

*FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*

On the evening of January 5, 1993, Trade Reeves and Molly Coffman, both
twelve years of age and students at West Carroll Middle School, spoke on
the telephone and decided to kill their homeroom teacher, Janice Geiger.
The girls agreed that Coffman would bring rat poison to school the
following day so that it could be placed in Geiger's drink. The *girls*
also agreed that they would thereafter steal Geiger's car and drive to
the Smoky Mountains. Reeves then contacted Dean Fouteh, a local high
school student, informed him of the plan, and asked him to drive
Geiger's car. Fouteh refused this request.

On the morning of January 6, Coffman placed a packet of rat poison in
her purse and boarded the school bus. **\[ ... \]**

When Geiger entered her classroom that morning she observed Reeves and
Coffman leaning over her desk; and when the girls noticed her, they
giggled and ran back to their seats. At that time Geiger saw a purse
lying next to her coffee cup on top of the desk. Shortly thereafter Argo
called Coff-man to the principal's office. Rat poison was found in
Coffman's purse and it was turned over to a Sheriffs Department
investigator. Both Reeves and Coffman gave written statements to the
investigator concerning their plan to poison Geiger and steal her car.

Reeves and Coffinan were found to be delinquent by the Carroll County
Juvenile Court, and both appealed from that ruling to the Carroll County
Circuit Court. After a jury found that the girls attempted to commit
second degree murder in violation of Tenn.Code Ann. § 39-12-101, the
"criminal attempt" statute, the trial court affirmed the juvenile
court's order and sentenced the girls to the Department of Youth
Development for an indefinite period. Reeves appealed from this judgment
to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
**\[ ... \]**Because we have not addressed the law of criminal attempt
since the comprehensive reform of our criminal law undertaken by the
legislature in 1989, we granted that application.

*Prior and Current Law of Criminal Attempt*

Before the passage of the reform legislation in 1989, the law of
criminal attempt, though sanctioned by various statutes, was judicially
defined. In order to submit an issue of criminal attempt to the jury,
the State was required to present legally sufficient evidence of: (1) an
intent to commit a specific crime; (2) an overt act toward the
commission of that crime; and (3) a failure to consummate the crime.
**\[ ... \]**

Of the elements of criminal attempt, the second, the "overt act"
requirement, was by far the most problematic. By attempting to draw a
sharp distinction between "mere preparation" to commit a criminal act,
which did not constitute the required overt act, and a "direct movement
toward the commission after the preparations had been made," *Dupuy,*
325 S.W.2d at 239, 240, which did, Tennessee courts construed the term
"overt act" very narrowly. The best example of this extremely narrow
construction occurred in *Dupuy.* In that case, the Memphis police
sought to lay a trap for a pharmacist suspected of performing illegal
abortions by sending a young woman to request these services from him.
After the woman had made several attempts to secure his services, he
finally agreed to perform the abortion. The pharmacist transported the
young woman to a hotel room, laid out his instruments in preparation for
the procedure, and asked the woman to remove her clothes. At that point
the police came into the room and arrested the pharmacist, who then
admitted that he had performed abortions in the past. The defendant was
convicted under a statute that made it illegal to procure a miscarriage,
and he appealed to this Court.

A majority of this Court reversed the conviction. After admitting that
the defendant's "reprehensible" course of conduct would doubtlessly have
resulted in the commission of the crime "had he not been thwarted in his
efforts by the arrival of the police," *Dupuy,* 325 S.W.2d at 239, the
majority concluded that:

> While the defendant had completed his plan to do this crime the
> element of attempt \[overt act\] does not appear in this record. The
> proof shows that he did not use any of the instruments and did not
> touch the body of the girl in question. Under such facts we do not
> think that the defendant is guilty under the statute.

Dupuy, 325 S.W.2d at 240.

To support its holding, the *Dupuy* court quoted a treatise passage
concerning actions that constituted "mere preparation," as opposed to
actions that would satisfy the overt act requirement:

> In a general way, however, it may be said that preparation consists in
> devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the
> commission of the offense and that the attempt \[overt act\] is the
> direct movement toward the commission after the preparations are made.
> Even though a person actually intends to commit a crime, his
> procurement of the instrumentalities adapted to that end will not
> constitute an attempt to commit the crime in the absence of some overt
> act.

*Id.* (quoting 14 Am.Jur. § 68 (1940)). To further illustrate the
foregoing principle the majority provided the following example: "the
procurement by a prisoner of tools adapted to breaking jail does not
render him guilty of an attempt to break jail." *Id.*

As indicated above, the sharp differentiation in *Dupuy* between "mere
preparation" and "overt act," or the "act itself," was characteristic of
the pre-1989 attempt law. **\[ ... \]**In 1989, however, the legislature
enacted a general criminal attempt statute, Tenn.Code Ann. § 39-12-101,
as part of its comprehensive overhaul of Tennessee's criminal law. In
that statute, the legislature did not simply codify the
judicially-created elements of the crime, but utilized language that had
up to then been entirely foreign to Tennessee attempt law. Section
39-12-101 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:

> \(a\) A person commits criminal attempt who, acting with the kind of
> culpability otherwise required for the offense:
>
> \(1\) Intentionally engages in action or causes a result that would
> constitute an offense if the circumstances surrounding the conduct
> were as the person believes them to be;
>
> \(2\) Acts with intent to cause a result that is an element of the
> offense, and believes the conduct will cause the result without
> further conduct on the person's part; or
>
> \(3\) Acts with intent to complete a course of action or cause a
> result that would constitute the offense, under the circumstances
> surrounding the conduct as the person believe them to be, *and the
> conduct constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the
> offense.*
>
> \(b\) Conduct does not constitute a *substantial step* under
> subdivision (a)(3) unless the person's entire course of action is
> corroborative of the intent to commit the offense.

(emphasis added.)

*The Substantial Step Issue*

As stated above, our task is to determine whether the defendant's
actions in this case constitute a "substantial step" toward the
commission of second degree murder under the new statute. The
"substantial step" issue has not yet been addressed by a Tennessee court
in a published opinion, and the question is made more difficult by the
fact that the legislature declined to set forth any definition of the
term, preferring instead to "leave the issue of what constitutes a
substantial step \[to the courts\] for determination in each particular
case." § 39-12-101, *Comments of Sentencing Commission.*

In addressing this issue, we first note that the legislature, in
enacting § 39-12-101, clearly looked to the criminal attempt section set
forth in the Model Penal Code. That section provides, in pertinent part,
as follows:

> \(1\) Definition of attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to
> commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise
> required for commission of the crime, he:
>
> \(a\) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if
> the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or
>
> \(b\) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime,
> does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the
> belief that it will cause such result, without further conduct on his
> part; or
>
> \(c\) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the
> circumstances as he believes them to be, is a *substantial step in a
> course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime*

Model Penal Code, Section 5.01 (emphasis added.)

The State argues that the striking similarity of Tenn.Code Ann. §
39-12-101 and the Model Penal Code evidences the legislature's intention
to abandon the old law of criminal attempt and instead adopt the Model
Penal Code approach. The State then avers that the model code contains
examples of conduct which, if proven, would entitle, but not require,
the jury to find that the defendant had taken a "substantial step;" and
that two of these examples are applicable to this case. The section of
the model code relied upon by the State, § 5.01(2), provides, in
pertinent part, as follows:

> \(2\) Conduct which may be held substantial step under paragraph
> (l)(c). Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step
> under paragraph (l)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly
> corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose. Without negativing the
> sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative
> of the actor's criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a
> matter of law:
>
> ![](media/image4.png){width="5.833333333333333in"
> height="0.6135225284339457in"}
>
> \(e\) *possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the
> crime,* *which are specially designed for such unlawful use or which
> can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;*
>
> \(f\) *possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be
> employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place
> contemplated for its commission, where such possession, collection or
> fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the
> circumstances;*
>
> ![](media/image5.png){width="5.833333333333333in"
> height="0.7017541557305337in"}

(emphasis added.)

The State concludes that because the issue of whether the defendant's
conduct constitutes a substantial step may be a jury question under the
model code, the jury was justified in finding her guilty of attempting
to commit second degree murder.

The defendant counters by arguing that despite the similarity of
Tenn.Code Ann. § 39-12-101 and the Model Penal Code's attempt provision,
the legislature intended to retain the sharp distinction between "mere
preparation" and the "act itself' characteristic of such decisions as
*Dupuy.* She supports this assertion by pointing out that although the
legislature could have easily included the examples set forth in §
5.01(2) of the model code, the Tennessee statute does not include the
examples. The defendant concludes that the new statute did not
substantially change Tennessee attempt law, and that her conviction must
be reversed because her actions constitute "mere preparation" under
*Dupuy.*

Initially, we cannot accept the argument that the legislature intended
to explicitly adopt the Model Penal Code approach, including the
examples set forth in § 5.01(2). Although § 39-12-101 is obviously based
on the model code, we agree with the defendant that the legislature
could have, if it had so desired, simply included the specific examples
in the Tennessee statute. That it did not do so prohibits us from
concluding that the legislature explicitly intended to adopt the model
code approach in all its particulars.

This conclusion does not mean, however, that the legislature intended to
retain the distinction between "mere preparation" and the "act itself."
Moreover, while we concede that a strong argument can be made that the
conviction conflicts with *Dupuy* because the defendant did not place
the poison in the cup, but simply brought it to the crime scene, we also
are well aware that the *Dupuy* approach to attempt law has been
consistently and effectively criticized. One persistent criticism of the
endeavor to separate "mere preparation" from the "act itself' is that
the question is ultimately not one of kind but of degree;[^55] the "act
itself' is merely one of the termini on a continuum of criminal
activity. Therefore, distinguishing between "mere preparation" and the
"act itself' in a principled manner is a difficult, if not impossible,
task.[^56] **\[ ... \]**The other principal ground of criticism of the
*Dupuy* approach bears directly on the primary objective of the law ---
that of preventing inchoate crimes from becoming full-blown ones. Many
courts and commentators have argued that failing to attach criminal
responsibility to the actor --- and therefore prohibiting law
enforcement officers from taking action\' --- until the actor is on the
brink of consummating the crime endangers the public and undermines the
preventative goal of attempt law. **\[ ... \]**

The shortcomings of the *Dupuy* rule with respect to the goal of
prevention are particularly evident in this case. As stated above, it is
likely that under *Dupuy* no criminal responsibility would have attached
unless the poison had actually been placed in the teacher's cup. This
rigid requirement, however, severely undercuts the objective of
prevention because of the surreptitious nature of the act of poisoning.
Once a person secretly places a toxic substance into a container from
which another person is likely to eat or drink, the damage is done.
Here, if it had not been for the intei'vention of the teacher, she could
have been rendered powerless to protect herself from harm.

After carefully weighing considerations of *stare decisis* against the
persuasive criticisms of the *Dupuy* rule, we conclude that this
artificial and potentially harmful rule must be abandoned. We hold that
when an actor possesses materials to be used in the commission of a
crime, at or near the scene of the crime, and where the possession of
those materials can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the
circumstances, the jury is entitled, but not required, to find that the
actor has taken a "substantial step" toward the commission of the crime
if such action is strongly corroborative of the actor's overall criminal
purpose.[^57] For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is affirmed.

BIRCH, Justice,

concurring and dissenting.

I concur in the majority's statement of the rule to be applied in
deciding whether a criminal attempt has occurred. I dissent, however,
from their application of that rule to this case.

**\[ ... \]**

Based upon this record, I would find that the *"entire* course of
action" of these two twelve-year-old girls was not "strongly
corroborative" of intent to commit second-degree murder and that the
evidence was insufficient as a matter of law. In looking at the "entire
course of action," we should remember that these were twelve-year-old
girls, not explosive-toting terrorists.

Accordingly, while I concur in the majority's abandonment of the rule
stated in *Dupuy v. State,* 204 Tenn. 624, 325 S.W.2d 238 (1959), I
dissent from the conclusion of the majority in this case.

United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit

96 F.3d 1495

No. 95-3096

**\[ ... \]**

WALD, Circuit Judge:

On April 4, 1995, a jury convicted Francisco Martin Duran of ten
criminal counts, all of which centered on the fact that on October 29,
1994, at around 3:00 in the afternoon, Duran stood on the Pennsylvania
Avenue sidewalk in front of the White House and fired at least
twenty-nine rounds across the North Lawn with an assault weapon. On
appeal, **\[ ... \]** Duran asserts that his actions on October 29,
1994, did not render him guilty of attempting to assassinate the
President of the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 1751(c). **\[ ...
\]**We find merit in none of these claims, and affirm Duran's
convictions.

**\[ ... \]** Duran violated § 1751(c) by engaging in a series of
"substantial steps" towards his goal of killing the President in the
days and hours leading up to the afternoon of October 29, 1994. **\[ ...
\]**

I. Background

In mid-September of 1994 Francisco Martin Duran, a 26-year-old
upholsterer from a suburb of Colorado Springs, Colorado, began to
purchase a number of assault weapons. Evidence presented at trial
established that on September 13, Duran bought an assault rifle and
about 100 rounds of ammunition. Two days later, he bought a thirty-round
clip and had the rifle equipped with a folding stock. Thirteen days
after that, Duran bought a shotgun, and the following day still more
ammunition. On September 30, Duran left work and, without contacting his
family or employer, began his journey to Washington, D.C. He purchased
another thirty-round clip in Charlottesville, Virginia on October 10,
and the next day bought a large overcoat in Richmond, Virginia. Later
that day Duran arrived in Washington, D.C., and checked into a hotel. He
stayed at various hotels in the Washington area between the tenth and
the twenty-ninth of October.

Shortly before 6:00 on the morning of October 29, Duran checked out of
the Embassy Suites Hotel in Tysons Comer, drove to downtown Washington,
and parked his track on 17th Street, between D and E Streets. By early
afternoon, he was standing in front of the north side of the White
House, wearing the overcoat he had purchased earlier on his trip. As
Duran stood by the White House fence, two eighth-grade students on a
field trip, Robert DeCamp and Brent Owens, ran to a point along the
fence thirteen feet away. DeCamp pointed toward a small group of men in
dark suits standing near the White House. One of these men, civilian
Dennis Basso, bore a strong resemblance to President Clinton. DeCamp
remarked that the man "looked like Bill Clinton," and Owens said "Yeah,
it does." Almost immediately after this exchange, Duran began firing the
rifle at Basso.

**\[ ... \]**

Searching his truck after his arrest, agents found one of the rifles
Duran had purchased en route to Washington, several boxes of ammunition,
nerve gas antidote, a letter in which Duran had written "Can you imagine
a higher moral calling than to destroy someone's dreams with one
bullet?," a road atlas on which Duran had written "Kill the Pres!," a
cover tom from a telephone book bearing a picture of President Clinton,
which Duran had defaced by drawing a circle around Clinton's head and an
"X" on his faee, a handwritten document with the heading "Last will and
words," an order form for the book "Hit Man," and several books about
out-of-body experiences. When they searched his house and office, law
enforcement agents found a business card on the back of which Duran had
written "Kill all government offices (sic) and department heads" and
assorted other pieces of anti-government literature.

II\. Discussion

**\[ ... \]**

B. *Application of the Attempted Assassination Statute to Duran's
Actions*

18 U.S.C. § 1751(c) provides, in pertinent part: 'Whoever attempts to
kill \[the President of the United States\] shall be punished by
imprisonment for any term of years or for life." The defense argues that
Duran's conviction under § 1751(c) should be reversed because Duran shot
at Dennis Basso, who is not the President. But under the statute and the
common law of attempt which it incorporates, the identity of the person
at whom Duran fired his assault rifle is irrelevant, given the
overwhelming evidence that, in the days and hours before the shooting,
he engaged in numerous "substantial steps" towards his objective of
assassinating the President.

Although § 1751 does not define "attempt," we have deemed it to
incorporate the common law definition of criminal attempt.[^58] We have
also noted elsewhere that most federal courts adhere to the definition
of criminal attempt outlined in the Model Penal Code,[^59] which
establishes that a defendant is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime
if, "acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for
commission of the crime," he "purposely does or omits to do anything
that, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or
omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned
to culminate in his commission of the crime."[^60]

The trial judge here instructed the jury on the "criminal purpose" and
"substantial step" components of attempt,[^61] and the jury heard
evidence indicating that Duran had on numerous occasions expressed, both
verbally and in writing, a strong desire to kill the President, and that
Duran had purchased a rifle, ammunition clips, and an overcoat large
enough to conceal the rifle (all of which he would eventually use in
firing toward a man on the White House lawn who resembled the
President), then traveled to Washington, D.C. and stood by the White
House gate with the rifle and ammunition concealed. The jury had ample
evidence, then, from which to conclude that Duran purchased weapons,
ammunition, and the overcoat, traveled from Colorado Springs to
Washington, D.C., and stood in front of the White House for several
hours with the weapons and ammunition on his person, with the purpose of
assassinating the President. Furthermore, the jury was entitled to find
that these acts constituted "substantial steps" taken in pursuit of this
objective. **\[ ... \]** **\[ ... \]** *See also* Model Penal Code §
5.01(2) (1985) ("the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor's
criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient \[to prove the
completion of a 'substantial step'\] as a matter of law: \... lying in
wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime
\... reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the
crime \... possession \... of materials to be employed in the commission
of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for its commission, if
such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of
the actor under the circumstances.").

Because the jury had ample evidence from which to conclude that Duran
had already completed the crime of attempted assassination of the
President before he began firing towards Dennis Basso, we need not
decide whether the evidence would have been sufficient to support the
conviction had the government been unable to prove that Duran had
already taken such "substantial steps" before he began firing. It
remains significant that the man Duran eventually fired at resembled
President Clinton, because this fact reflected back on Duran's actions
prior to the shooting, helping to show that he bought the weapons,
ammunition, and overcoat, and brought himself and these items to the
sidewalk in front of the North Lawn of the White House, with the purpose
of nearing his objective of taking the President's life. The fact that
Duran was mistaken in thinking that the man he fired at was the
President could not erase the multitude of "substantial steps" that he
had already completed, and therefore we hold that the jury was presented
with sufficient evidence to support its conclusion that Duran violated §
1751 by attempting to assassinate the President of the United States.

**\[ ... \]**

III\. Conclusion

**\[ ... \]** The attempted assassination statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1751, was
properly applied to Duran, and the jury had sufficient evidence to find
him guilty, under 18 U.S.C. § 111, of assaulting the four Secret Service
agents stationed on the North Lawn. Accordingly, the defendant's
convictions are

*Affirmed.***\[ ... \]**

Notes and Questions - State v. Reeves, U.S. v. Duran

 

1.  [United States v.
    Jackson](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=Y&pubNum=0000350&sernum=1977123310&__lrTS=20200726191401123&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29),
    560 F.2d 112 (2d Cir. 1977):

"The draftsmen of the Model Penal Code recognized the difficulty of
arriving at a general standard for distinguishing acts of preparation
from acts constituting an attempt. \* \* \* The problem then was to
devise a standard more inclusive than one requiring the last proximate
act before attempt liability would attach, but less inclusive than one
which would make every act done with the intent to commit a crime
criminal. \* \* \*

The formulation upon which the draftsmen ultimately agreed required, in
addition to criminal purpose, that an act be a substantial step in a
course of conduct designed to accomplish a criminal result, and that it
be strongly corroborative of criminal purpose in order for it to
constitute such a substantial step. The following differences between
this test and previous approaches to the preparation-attempt problem
were noted:

First, this formulation shifts the emphasis from what remains to be
done---the chief concern of the proximity tests---to what the actor has
already done. The fact that further major steps must be taken before the
crime can be completed does not preclude a finding that the steps
already undertaken are substantial. It is expected, in the normal case,
that this approach will broaden the scope of attempt liability.

Second, although it is intended that the requirement of a substantial
step will result in the imposition of attempt liability only in those
instances in which some firmness of criminal purpose is shown, no
finding is required as to whether the actor would probably have desisted
prior to completing the crime. \* \* \*

Finally, the requirement of proving a substantial step generally will
prove less of a hurdle for the prosecution than the res ipsa loquitur
approach, which requires that the actor's conduct must itself manifest
the criminal purpose. The difference will be illustrated in connection
with the present section's requirement of corroboration. Here it should
be noted that, in the present formulation, the two purposes to be served
by the res ipsa loquitur test are, to a large extent, treated
separately. Firmness of criminal purpose is intended to be shown by
requiring a substantial step, while problems of proof are dealt with by
the requirement of corroboration (although, under the reasoning
previously expressed, the latter will also tend to establish firmness of
purpose).

[Model Penal Code §
5.01](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.01&__lrTS=20200726191711260&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29),
Comment at 47 (Tent. Draft No. 10, 1960).

The draftsmen concluded that, in addition to assuring firmness of
criminal design, the requirement of a substantial step would preclude
attempt liability, with its accompanying harsh penalties, for relatively
remote preparatory acts. At the same time, however, by not requiring a
"last proximate act" or one of its various analogues it would permit the
apprehension of dangerous persons at an earlier stage than the other
approaches without immunizing them from attempt liability."

2.  [Model Penal Code §
    5.01](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.01&__lrTS=20200726191711260&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29)(2),
    further develops what constitutes a "substantial step" under
    subsection 1(c), which applies in cases where the attempt is
    incomplete. In order for the trial judge to require that the jury be
    instructed pursuant to subsection 1(c), the prosecutor must
    demonstrate that conduct enumerated in subsection 2 has been
    performed.

"The substantial step test\'s most significant feature was its expansion
of attempt liability beyond the common law\'s standards. Many of the
examples of conduct listed by the MPC as sufficient to prove a
substantial step include conduct that would have been insufficient at
common law. \* \* \* 

The MPC\'s Commentaries acknowledged that the substantial step
formulation would broaden attempt liability beyond the scope of
common-law attempt doctrines. This broader definition was included in
the MPC itself to facilitate the 'apprehension of \[certain\] dangerous
persons' and allow law enforcement to intervene earlier to reduce the
risk of harm caused by the criminal conduct 'without providing \[the\]
immunity' from prosecution that the offender would enjoy under
common-law approaches."

interested in buying land in the area. Mr. Thomas told Mrs. Parrish
about the plan to murder her, and she subsequently called the police.
Mr. Thomas and Defendant met as planned and proceeded to Mrs. Parrish's
home. Defendant carried gloves and the rifle and walked up to the house,
where he and Mr. Thomas listened to see how many people were currently
in the house. They then returned to their parked car where Defendant
told Mr. Thomas to go into the house and choke Mrs. Parrish. Defendant
proceeded to explain that once Mr. Thomas completed that, he could leave

United States v. Oviedo

 

United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

525 F.2d 881

No. 75-1899

1976-01-12

**\[ ... \]**

DYER, Circuit Judge.

Oviedo appeals from a judgment of conviction for the attempted
distribution of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. § 846.[^62] Oviedo
contends that under the facts of this case, he is not guilty of any
criminal offense. We agree and reverse.

Oviedo was contacted by an undercover agent, who desired to purchase
narcotics. Arrangements were made for the sale of one pound of heroin.
The agent met Oviedo at the appointed time and place. Oviedo transferred
the substance to the agent, and asked for his money in return. However,
the agent informed Oviedo that he would first have to test the
substance. A field test was performed with a positive result. Oviedo was
placed under arrest.

Subsequent to the arrest, a search warrant was issued for Oviedo's
residence. When the search was executed, two pounds of a similar
substance was found hidden in a television set. Up to this point, the
case appeared unexceptional.

A chemical analysis was performed upon the substances seized, revealing
that the substances were not in fact heroin, but rather procaine
hydrochloride, an uncontrolled substance.[^63] Since any attempt to
prosecute for distribution of heroin would have been futile, the
defendant was charged with an attempt to distribute heroin.

At trial, Oviedo took the stand and stated that he knew the substance
was not heroin, and that he, upon suggestion of his cohorts, was merely
attempting to "rip off" the agent. It was, in his view, an easy way to
pocket a few thousand dollars.

The court instructed the jury that they could find Oviedo guilty of
attempted distribution if he delivered the substance thinking it to be
heroin.[^64] The jury rejected Oviedo's claimed knowledge of the true
nature of the substance, and returned a verdict of guilty. Although
Oviedo argues on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to
establish that he thought the substance was heroin, this contention is
without merit.[^65] We thus take as fact Oviedo's belief that the
substance was heroin.

The facts before us are therefore simple --- Oviedo sold a substance he
thought to be heroin, which in reality was an uncontrolled substance.
The legal question before us is likewise simple --- -are these combined
acts and intent cognizable as a criminal attempt under 21 U.S.C.A. §
846. The answer, however, is not so simple.

Oviedo and the government both agree the resolution of this case rests
in an analysis of the doctrines of legal and factual impossibility as
defenses to a criminal attempt. Legal impossibility occurs when the
actions which the defendant performs or sets in motion, even if fully
carried out as he desires, would not constitute a crime. *U. S. v.
Conway,* 5 Cir. 1975, 507 F.2d 1047. Factual impossibility occurs when
the objective of the defendant is proscribed by the criminal law but a
circumstance unknown to the actor prevents him from bringing about that
objective. *Id.* at 1050. The traditional analysis recognizes legal
impossibility as a valid defense, but refuses to so recognize factual
impossibility. *U. S. v. Berrigan,* 3 Cir. 1973, 482 F.2d 171.

These definitions are not particularly helpful here, for they do nothing
more than provide a different focus for the analysis. In one sense, the
impossibility involved here might be deemed legal, for those *acts*
which Oviedo set in motion, the transfer of the substance in his
possession, were not a crime. In another sense, the impossibility is
factual, for the *objective* of Oviedo, the sale of heroin, was
proscribed by law, and failed only because of a circumstance unknown to
Oviedo.[^66]

Although this issue has been the subject of numerous legal
commentaries,[^67] federal cases reaching this question are few, and no
consensus can be found.[^68] **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

When the defendant sells a substance which is actually heroin, it is
reasonable to infer that he knew the physical nature of the substance,
and to place on him the burden of dispelling that inference. *United
States v. Moser,* 7 Cir. 1975, 509 F.2d 1089, 1092; *United States v.
Joly, 2* Cir. 1974, 493 F.2d 672, 676.[^69] However, if we convict the
defendant of attempting to sell heroin for the sale of a non-narcotic
substance, we eliminate an objective element that has major evidentiary
significance and we increase the risk of mistaken conclusions that the
defendant believed the goods were narcotics.[^70]

Thus, we demand that in order for a defendant to be guilty of a criminal
attempt, the objective acts performed, without any reliance on the
accompanying *mens rea,* mark the defendant's conduct as criminal in
nature. The acts should be unique rather than so commonplace that they
are engaged in by persons not in violation of the law.

Here we have only two objective facts. First, Oviedo told the agent that
the substance he was selling was heroin, and second, portions of the
substance were concealed in a television set. If another objective fact
were present, if the substance were heroin, we would have a strong
objective basis for the determination of criminal intent and conduct
consistent and supportative of that intent. The test set out above would
be met, and, absent a delivery, the criminal attempt would be
established. But when this objective basis for the determination of
intent is removed, when the substance is not heroin, the conduct becomes
ambivalent, and we are left with a sufficiency-of-the-evidence
determination of intent rejected in the preparation --- attempt
dichotomy. We cannot conclude that the objective acts of Oviedo apart
from any indirect evidence of intent mark his conduct as criminal in
nature. Rather, those acts are consistent with a noncriminal enterprise.
Therefore, we will not allow the jury's determination of Oviedo's intent
to form the sole basis of a criminal offense.

The government also argues that *United States v. Mandujano, supra,*
although involving a preparation --- attempt determination, compels a
contrary result. In *Mandujano,* the defendant negotiated a sale of
heroin with an undercover agent. After taking the agent's money, the
defendant set about to find his source. He was unsuccessful, and
returned a few hours later with the money and without the heroin. We
found the evidence sufficient to take the case beyond preparation, and
to support his conviction for attempted distribution.

In making that determination, we recognized that in order to be guilty
of an attempt, the objective conduct of the defendant must strongly
corroborate the firmness of the defendant's criminal intent. *Id.* at
376. The objective acts must not be equivocal in nature. In that case,
we had as objective facts defendant's act of taking money and his
personal statements that he would purchase heroin with that money.
Importantly, there were no objective facts which made these acts
equivocal.

The situation in *Mandujano* is distinguishable from that now before us.
Just as it is reasonable to infer a person's knowledge and criminal
intent from the possession of a substance which is in fact narcotics,
*United States v. Moser, supra; United States v. Joly, supra,* it is
also reasonable to infer that same knowledge and intent from an
individual's statements of future intention. *Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Hillmon,* 1892, 145 U.S. 285, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706; *Shurman v.
United States,* 5 Cir. 1955, 219 F.2d 282, 290, fn. 9; *United States v.
Hoffa,* 6 Cir. 1965, 349 F.2d 20, 45; *United States v. Annunziato, 2*
Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 373, 377. However, just as it is impossible to infer
that intent when the substance possessed is not in fact narcotics, it is
also impossible to infer that intent when objective facts indicate that
the person did not carry out his self-proclaimed intention.

Thus, when Mandujano stated that he would purchase heroin, we could
infer that he intended to purchase heroin since there were no objective
facts to the contrary. But here, Oviedo stated he would sell heroin and
then sold procaine. Based on these objective facts, we cannot infer that
he intended to do that which he said he was going to do, because he in
fact did something else.

Young, J.

We granted leave in this case to consider whether the doctrine of
"impossibility" provides a defense to a charge of attempt to commit an
offense prohibited by law under MCL 750.92, or to a charge of
solicitation to commit a felony under MCL 750.157b. The circuit court
granted defendant's motion to quash and dismissed all charges against
him on the basis that it was legally impossible for him to have
committed any of the charged crimes. We conclude that the concept of
impossibility, which this Court has never adopted as a defense, is not
relevant to a determination whether a defendant has committed attempt
under MCL 750.92, and that the circuit court therefore erred in
dismissing the charge of attempted distribution of obscene material to a
minor on the basis of the doctrine of legal impossibility. We
additionally conclude that, although the Court of Appeals erred to the
extent that it relied upon the concept of "impossibility" in dismissing
the charge of solicitation of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, the
charge was nevertheless properly dismissed because there is no evidence
that defendant solicited any person to *"commit a felony"* or to "do or
omit to do an act which if completed would *constitute a felony"* as
proscribed by MCL 750.157b. Accordingly, we reverse in part and affirm
in part the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to
the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

I. FACTUAL[^71] AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Deputy William Liczbinski was assigned by the Wayne County Sheriffs
Department to conduct an undercover investigation for the department's
Internet Crimes Bureau. Liczbinski was instructed to pose as a minor and
log onto "chat rooms" on the Internet for the purpose of identifying
persons using the Internet as a means for engaging in criminal activity.

On December 8, 1998, while using the screen name "Bekka," Liczbinski was
approached by defendant, who was using the screen name "Mr. Auto-Mag,"
in an Internet chat room. Defendant described himself as a
twenty-three-year-old male from Warren, and Bekka described herself as a
fourteen-year-old female from Detroit. Bekka indicated that her name was
Becky Fellins, and defendant revealed that his name was Chris Thousand.
During this initial conversation, defendant sent Bekka, via the
Internet, a photograph of his face.

From December 9 through 16, 1998, Liczbinski, still using the screen
name "Bekka," engaged in chat room conversation with defendant. During
these exchanges, the conversation became sexually explicit. Defendant
made repeated lewd invitations to Bekka to engage in various sexual
acts, despite various indications of her young age.[^72]

During one of his online conversations with Bekka, after asking her
whether anyone was "around there," watching her, defendant indicated
that he was sending her a picture of himself. Within seconds, Liczbinski
received over the Internet a photograph of male genitalia. Defendant
asked Bekka whether she liked and wanted it and whether she was getting
"hot" yet, and described in a graphic manner the type of sexual acts he
wished to perform with her. Defendant invited Bekka to come see him at
his house for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. Bekka replied
that she wanted to do so, and defendant cautioned her that they had to
be careful, because he could "go to jail." Defendant asked whether Bekka
looked "over sixteen," so that if his roommates were home he could lie.

The two then planned to meet at an area McDonald's restaurant at 5:00
P.M. on the following Thursday. Defendant indicated that they could go
to his house, and that he would tell his brother that Bekka was
seventeen. Defendant instructed Bekka to wear a "nice sexy skirt,"
something that he could "get \[his\] head into." Defendant indicated
that he would be dressed in black pants and shirt and a brown suede
coat, and that he would be driving a green Duster. Bekka asked defendant
to bring her a present, and indicated that she liked white teddy bears.

On Thursday, December 17, 1998, Liczbinski and other deputy sheriffs
were present at the specified McDonald's restaurant when they saw
defendant inside a vehicle matching the description given to Bekka by
defendant. Defendant, who was wearing a brown suede jacket and black
pants, got out of the vehicle and entered the restaurant. Liczbinski
recognized defendant's face from the photograph that had been sent to
Bekka. Defendant looked around for approximately thirty seconds before
leaving the restaurant. Defendant was then taken into custody. Two white
teddy bears were recovered from defendant's vehicle. Defendant's
computer was subsequently seized from his home. A search of the hard
drive revealed electronic logs of Internet conversations matching those
printed out by Liczbinski from the Wayne County-owned computer he had
used in his Internet conversations with defendant.

Following a preliminary examination, defendant was bound over for trial
on charges of solicitation to commit third-degree criminal sexual
conduct, MCL 750.157b(3)(a) and 750.520d(l)(a), attempted distribution
of obscene material to a minor, MCL 750.92 and 722.675, and child
sexually abusive activity, MCL 750.145c(2).[^73]

Defendant brought a motion to quash the information, arguing that,
because the existence of a child victim was an element of each of the
charged offenses, the evidence was legally insufficient to support the
charges. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the case, holding that
it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the charged
offenses. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the charges of
solicitation and attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor,
but reversed the dismissal of the charge of child sexually abusive
activity.[^74] 241 Mich App 102 (2000).

We granted the prosecution's application for leave to appeal.[^75] 463
Mich 907 (2000).

H. STANDARD OF REVIEW

We must determine in this case whether the circuit court and the Court
of Appeals properly applied the doctrine of "legal impossibility" in
concluding that the charges against defendant of attempt and
solicitation must be dismissed. The applicability of a legal doctrine is
a question of law that is reviewed de novo. *James v Alberts,* 464 Mich
12, 14; 626 NW2d 158 (2001). Similarly, the issue whether
"impossibility" is a cognizable defense under Michigan's attempt and
solicitation statutes presents questions of statutory construction,
which we review de novo. *People v Clark,* 463 Mich 459, 463, n 9; 619
NW2d 538 (2000); *People v Morey,* 461 Mich 325, 329; 603 NW2d 250
(1999).

m\. ANALYSIS

A. THE "IMPOSSIBILITY" DOCTRINE

The doctrine of "impossibility" as it has been discussed in the context
of inchoate crimes represents the conceptual dilemma that arises when,
because of the defendant's mistake of fact or law, his actions could not
possibly have resulted in the commission of the substantive crime
underlying an attempt charge. Classic illustrations of the concept of
impossibility include: (1) the defendant is prosecuted for attempted
larceny after he tries to "pick" the victim's empty pocket[^76]; (2) the
defendant is prosecuted for attempted rape after he tries to have
nonconsensual intercourse, but is unsuccessful because he is
impotent[^77]; (3) the defendant is prosecuted for attempting to receive
stolen property where the property he received was not, in fact,
stolen[^78]; and (4) the defendant is prosecuted for attempting to hunt
deer out of season after he shoots at a stuffed decoy deer.[^79] In each
of these examples, despite evidence of the defendant's criminal intent,
he cannot be prosecuted for the *completed* offense of larceny, rape,
receiving stolen property, or hunting deer out of season, because proof
of at least one element of each offense cannot be derived from his
objective actions. The question, then, becomes whether the defendant can
be prosecuted for the *attempted* offense, and the answer is dependent
upon whether he may raise the defense of "impossibility."

Courts and legal scholars have drawn a distinction between two
categories of impossibility: "factual impossibility" and "legal
impossibility." It has been said that, at common law, legal
impossibility is a defense to a charge of attempt, but factual
impossibility is not. See American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and
Commentaries (1985), comment to § 5.01, pp 307-317; Perkins & Boyce,
Criminal Law (3d ed), p 632; Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law (1st
ed), § 27.07\[B\], p 349. However, courts and scholars alike have
struggled unsuccessfully over the years to articulate an accurate rule
for distinguishing between the categories of "impossibility."

"Factual impossibility," which has apparently never been recognized in
any American jurisdiction as a defense to a charge of attempt,[^80]
"exists when \[the defendant's\] intended end constitutes a crime but
she fails to consummate it because of a factual circumstance unknown to
her or beyond her control." Dressier, *supra,* § 27.07\[C\]\[1\], p 350.
An example of a "factual impossibility" scenario is where the defendant
is prosecuted for attempted minder after pointing an unloaded gun at
someone and pulling the trigger, where the defendant believed the gun
was loaded.[^81]

The category of "legal impossibility" is further divided into two
subcategories: "pure" legal impossibility and "hybrid" legal
impossibility. Although it is generally undisputed that "pure" legal
impossibility will bar an attempt conviction, the concept of "hybrid
legal impossibility" has proven problematic. As Professor Dressier
points out, the failure of courts to distinguish between "pure" and
"hybrid" legal impossibility has created confusion in this area of the
law. Dressier, *supra,* § 27.07\[D\]\[1\], p 351.

*"Pure legal impossibility* exists if the criminal law does not prohibit
*D's* conduct or the result that she has sought to achieve." *Id.,* §
27.07\[D\]\[2\], p 352 (emphasis in original). In other words, the
concept of pure legal impossibility applies when an actor engages in
conduct that he believes is criminal, but is not actually prohibited by
law: "There can be no conviction of criminal attempt based upon d's
erroneous notion that he was committing a crime." Perkins & Boyce,
*supra,* p 634. As an example, consider the case of a man who believes
that the legal age of consent is sixteen years old, and who believes
that a girl with whom he had consensual sexual intercourse is fifteen
years old. If the law actually fixed the age of consent at fifteen, this
man would not be guilty of attempted statutory rape, despite his
mistaken belief that the law prohibited his conduct. See Dressier,
*supra,* § 27.07\[D\]\[2\], pp 352-353, n 25.

When courts speak of "legal impossibility," they are generally referring
to what is more accurately described as "hybrid" legal impossibility.

> Most claims of legal impossibility are of the hybrid variety. *Hybrid
> legal impossibility* exists if d's goal was illegal, but commission of
> the offense was impossible due to a factual mistake by her regarding
> the legal status of some factor relevant to her conduct. This version
> of impossibility is a "hybrid" because, as the definition implies and
> as is clarified immediately below, d's impossibility claim includes
> both a legal and a factual aspect to it.
>
> Courts have recognized a defense of legal impossibility or have stated

> is alive; or shoots at a tree stump believing that it is a human.
>
> Notice that each of the mistakes in these cases affected the legal

> to commit the crime of murder or to "take and carry away the personal
> property *of another."* Finally, putting a bullet into a stuffed deer
> can never constitute the crime of hunting out of season.
>
> On the other hand, in each example of hybrid legal impossibility *D*

> victim was an animal subject to being hunted out of season.
> \[Dressier, *supra,* § 27.07\[D\]\[3\]\[a\], pp 353-354 (emphasis in
> original).\]

As the Court of Appeals panel in this case accurately noted, it is
possible to view virtually any example of "hybrid legal impossibility"
as an example of "factual impossibility":

> *"Ultimately any case of hybrid legal impossibility may reasonably be
> characterized as factual impossibility. . . .* \[B\]y skillful
> characterization, one can describe virtually any case of hybrid legal
> impossibility, which is a common law defense, as an example of factual
> impossibility, which is *not* a defense." \[241 Mich App 106 (emphasis
> in original), quoting Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law (2d ed), §
> 27.07\[D\]\[3\]\[a\], pp 374-375.\]

See also Weiss, *Scope, mistake, and impossibility: The philosophy of
language and problems of mens rea,* 83 Colum L R 1029, 1029-1030 (1983)
("\[because ordinary English cannot adequately distinguish among the
various kinds of impossible attempts, courts and commentators have
frequently misclassified certain types of cases"); *United States v
Thomas,* 13 CMA 278, 283; 32 CMR 278, 283 (1962) ("\[w\]hat is
abundantly clear \... is that it is most difficult to classify any
particular state of facts as positively coming within one of these
categories to the exclusion of the other"); *State v Moretti,* 52 NJ
182, 189; 244 A2d 499 (1968) ("\[o\]ur examination of \[authorities
discussing the doctrine of impossibility\] convinces us that the
application of the defense of impossibility is so fraught with
intricacies and artificial distinctions that the defense has little
value as an analytical method for reaching substantial justice").

It is notable that "the great majority of jurisdictions have now
recognized that legal and factual impossibility are 'logically
indistinguishable' . . . and have abolished impossibility as a defense."
*United States v Hsu,* 155 F3d 189, 199 (CA 3, 1998).[^82] For example,
several states have adopted statutory provisions similar to Model Penal
Code, § 5.01(1),[^83] which provides:

> A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the
> kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime,
> he:
>
> \(a\) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if
> the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or
>
> \(b\) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime,
> does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the
> belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his
> part; or
>
> \(c\) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the
> circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission
> constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to
> culminate in his commission of the crime.

In other jurisdictions, courts have considered the "impossibility"
defense under attempt statutes that did not include language explicitly
abolishing the defense. Several of these courts have simply declined to
participate in the sterile academic exercise of categorizing a
particular set of facts as representing "factual" or "legal"
impossibility, and have instead examined solely the words of the
applicable attempt statute. See *Darnell v State,* 92 Nev 680; 558 P2d
624 (1976); *Moretti, supra* at 189; *People v Rojas,* 55 Cal 2d 252;
358 P2d 921 (1961).

B. ATTEMPTED DISTRIBUTION OF OBSCENE MATERIAL TO A MINOR

The Court of Appeals panel in this case, after examining Professor
Dressler's exposition of the doctrine of impossibility, concluded that
it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the charged
offense of attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor. The
panel held that, because "Bekka" was, in fact, an adult, an essential
requirement of the underlying substantive offense was not met
(dissemination to a minor), and therefore it was legally impossible for
defendant to have committed the crime.

We begin by noting that the concept of "impossibility," in either its
"factual" or "legal" variant, has never been recognized by this Court as
a valid defense to a charge of attempt. In arguing that impossibility is
a judicially recognized defense in Michigan, defendant relies heavily on
our statement in *People v Tinskey,* 394 Mich 108; 228 NW2d 782 (1975),
that

> \[i\]t is possible, *although we need not decide,* that defendants
> could not have been convicted of attempted abortion; at common law the
> general rule is that while factual impossibility is not a defense
> *(People v Jones,* 46 Mich 441; 9 NW 486 \[1881\])\[[^84]\], legal
> impossibility is a defense. LaFave & Scott, Criminal Law, § 62, p 474.
> \[Emphasis supplied.\]

As is readily apparent, our statement in *Tinskey* regarding "legal
impossibility" as a defense to an attempt charge is nothing more than
obiter dictum. The defendants in *Tinskey* were not charged with
attempt; rather, they were charged with statutory conspiracy. Moreover,
we *specifically declined* in *Tinskey* to express any opinion regarding
the viability of the "impossibility" defense in the context of attempts.
No other Michigan Supreme Court case has referenced, much less adopted,
the impossibility defense.

Finding no recognition of impossibility in our common law, we turn now
to the terms of the statute. MCL 750.92 provides, in relevant part:

> Any person who shall attempt to commit an offense prohibited by law,
> and in such attempt shall do any act towards the commission of such
> offense, but shall fail in the perpetration, or shall be intercepted
> or prevented in the execution of the same, when no express provision
> is made by law for the punishment of such attempt, shall be punished
> as follows:
>
> 3\. If the offense so attempted to be committed is punishable by
> imprisonment in the state prison for a term less than 5 years, or
> imprisonment in the county jail or by fine, the offender convicted of
> such attempt shall be guilty of a misdemeanor \....

Under our statute, then, an "attempt" consists of (1) an attempt to
commit an offense prohibited by law, and (2) any act towards the
commission of the intended offense. We have further explained the
elements of attempt under our statute as including "an intent to do an
act or to bring about certain consequences which would in law amount to
a crime\[[^85]\]; and \... an act in furtherance of that intent which,
as it is most commonly put, goes beyond mere preparation." *People v
Jones,* 443 Mich 88, 100; 504 NW2d 158 (1993), quoting 2 LaFave & Scott,
Substantive Criminal Law, § 6.2, p 18.

In determining whether "impossibility," were we to recognize the
doctrine, is a viable defense to a charge of attempt under MCL 750.92,
our obligation is to examine the statute in an effort to discern and
give effect to the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred
from the text of the statute itself. *People v McIntire,* 461 Mich 147,
152-153; 599 NW2d 102 (1999). "When a legislature has unambiguously
conveyed its intent in a statute, the statute speaks for itself and
there is no need for judicial construction; the proper role of a court
is simply to *apply* the terms of the statute to the circumstances in a
particular case." *Id.* at 153 (citation omitted). Accordingly, if our
Legislature has indicated its intent to criminalize certain conduct
despite the actor's mistake of fact, this Court does not have the
authority to create and apply a substantive defense based upon the
concept of "impossibility." See *People v Glass (After Remand),* 464
Mich 266; 627 NW2d 261 (2001).

We are unable to discern from the words of the attempt statute any
legislative intent that the concept of "impossibility" provide any
impediment to charging a defendant with, or convicting him of, an
attempted crime, notwithstanding any factual mistake---regarding either
the attendant circumstances or the legal status of some factor relevant
thereto---that he may harbor. The attempt statute carves out no
exception for those who, possessing the requisite criminal intent to
commit an offense prohibited by law and taking action toward the
commission of that offense, have acted under an extrinsic misconception.

Defendant in this case is not charged with the substantive crime of
distributing obscene material to a minor in violation of MCL
722.675.[^86] It is unquestioned that defendant could not be convicted
of that crime, because defendant allegedly distributed obscene material
not to "a minor," but to an adult man. Instead, defendant is charged
with the distinct offense of attempt, which requires only that the
prosecution prove intention to commit an offense prohibited by law,
coupled with conduct toward the commission of that offense. The notion
that it would be "impossible" for the defendant to have committed the
*completed* offense is simply irrelevant to the analysis. Rather, in
deciding guilt on a charge of attempt, the trier of fact must examine
the unique circumstances of the particular case and determine whether
the prosecution has proven that the defendant possessed the requisite
specific intent and that he engaged in some act "towards the commission"
of the intended offense.

Because the nonexistence of a minor victim does not give rise to a
viable defense to the attempt charge in this case, the circuit court
erred in dismissing this charge on the basis of "legal impossibility."

C. SOLICITATION TO COMMIT THIRD-DEGREE CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT

1\. ANALYSIS

Defendant was additionally charged, on the basis of his Internet
conversations with "Bekka," with solicitation to commit third-degree
criminal sexual conduct. Defendant maintains that it was "legally
impossible" for him to have committed this crime, because the underlying
felony requires the existence of a child under the age of sixteen.[^87]
The Court of Appeals panel agreed, concluding that it was legally
impossible for defendant to have committed the crime because the
underlying form of third-degree criminal sexual conduct charged, MCL
750.520d(l)(a), required the existence of a person under the age of
sixteen. The panel further concluded that it was legally impossible for
defendant to have committed the crime for the additional reason that he
did not "solicit\^ another person to commit a felony" as proscribed by
the solicitation statute.

Our solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b, provides as follows, in relevant
part:

> \(1\) For purposes of this section, "solicit" means to offer to give,
> promise to give, or give any money, services, or anything of value, or
> to forgive or promise to forgive a debt or obligation.
>
> \(3\) . . . \[A\] person who solicits *another person to commit a
> felony,* or who solicits *another person to do or omit to do an act
> which if completed would constitute a felony,* is punishable as
> follows:
>
> \(a\) If the offense solicited is a felony punishable by imprisonment
> for life, or for 5 years or more, the person is guilty of a felony
> \.... \[Emphasis supplied.\]

The Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it relied on the doctrine
of "impossibility" as a ground for affirming the circuit court's
dismissal of the solicitation charge. As we have explained, Michigan has
never adopted the doctrine of impossibility as a defense in its
traditional *attempt* context, much less in the context of
*solicitation* crimes. Moreover, we are unable to locate any authority,
and defendant has provided none, for the proposition that
"impossibility" is a recognized defense to a charge of solicitation in
other jurisdictions.[^88]

Nevertheless, the solicitation charge was properly dismissed for the
reason that there is no evidence that defendant in our case solicited
anyone "to commit a felony" or "to do or omit to do an act which if
completed would constitute a felony" as prohibited by MCL 750.157b.
Pursuant to the plain statutory language, the prosecution was required
to present evidence that defendant requested that *another person*
perform a criminal act. The evidence here shows only that defendant
requested that "Bekka" engage in sexual acts with him. While the
requested acts might well have constituted a crime on defendant's part,
"Bekka" (or Liczbinski) would not have committed third-degree criminal
sexual conduct had she (or he) done as defendant suggested. As the Court
of Appeals properly concluded:

> What is lacking here is defendant's request to another person to
> commit a crime. "Bekka," the fourteen-year-old online persona of

Accordingly, while the concept of "impossibility" has no role in the
analysis of this issue, we agree with the panel's conclusion that an
element of the statutory offense is missing and that the solicitation
charge was therefore properly dismissed.

2\. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT

In his partial dissent, Justice Taylor opines that our construction of
MCL 750.157b(3) renders the second phrase of that subsection a
"nullity," and that this phrase---"or who solicits another person to do
or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a
felony"---should be read to encompass "situations where the solicitee
could not be charged with the felony, but the solicitor could be."
*Post* at 181. We disagree.

We first note that, pursuant to the plain language of this phrase, it is
the act of *"another* person" that must, if completed, "constitute a
felony." We believe that the plain language of the statute does not
support the interpretation our dissenting colleague gives it.

Moreover, our construction of § 157b(3) does not render the second
phrase of that subsection "nugatory" or "surplusage." Rather, it appears
that the Legislature, by its use of the phrase "do or omit to do an act
which if completed would constitute a felony," intended to make clear
that the solicited offense does not have to be completed.

It is noteworthy that § 157b was substantially amended in 1986,
following this Court's holding in *People v Rehkopf,* 422 Mich 198; 370
NW2d 296 (1985). In *Rehkopf,* this Court examined two cases in which
the defendants were charged under the former version of § 157b.
Defendant Rehkopf had asked an undercover police officer to kill her
husband, and defendant Snyder had asked someone to kill his brother. In
neither case did the intended murder ever occur. This Court held that
the statute was not violated where the defendants' conduct did not lead
to the results the defendants urged---namely, the deaths of Rehkopf's
husband or Snyder's brother.

In 1985, the statute read as follows, in pertinent part:

> Any person who incites, induces or exhorts any other person to \... do
> any act which would constitute a felony . . . shall be punished in the
> same manner as if he had committed the offense incited, induced or
> exhorted.

The *Rehkopf* majority held that

> § 157b does not subject a person to criminal responsibility for
> utterances that do not result in the commission of the offense sought
> to be committed. A person who does no more than utter words seeking
> the commission of an offense is subject to liability only for the
> common-law offense of solicitation. *\[Id.* at 205.\]\[[^89]\]

Justice Boyle and Chief Justice Williams dissented, opining that § 157b
contained no requirement "that the solicitation result in either actual
incitement or completion of the solicited offense." *Id.* at 223.

In 1986, the Legislature rewrote § 157b. The first clause of current
subsection 157b(3) ("a person who solicits another person to commit a
felony"), apart from using the term "solicits," is quite similar to the
phrase "\[a\]ny person who incites, induces or exhorts any other person
to do any act which would constitute a felony" as used in the prior
version of § 157b. However, the Legislature apparently deemed it
necessary---reasonably so, in light of the *Rehkopf* Court's
construction of § 157b---to clarify that the solicited act need not be
completed in order to satisfy the elements of the statute. Accordingly,
the second clause of subsection 157b(3) provides further that the
statute is violated where the defendant "solicits another person to do
or omit to do an act which *if completed* would constitute a felony"
(emphasis supplied). It is quite probable that the Legislature believed
that the phrase "solicits another person to commit a felony" would not
have reached solicitations in which the solicited act never came to
fruition, and that the second clause was added for this purpose.

IV\. CONCLUSION

This Court has never recognized the doctrine of impossibility. Moreover,
we are unable to discern any legislative intent that the doctrine may be
advanced as a defense to a charge of attempt under MCL 750.92.
Accordingly, the circuit court erred in dismissing this charge on the
basis that it was "legally impossible" for defendant to have committed
the crime.

Furthermore, although we do not agree with the circuit court or the
Court of Appeals that "legal impossibility" was properly invoked by
defendant as a defense to the charge of solicitation, we nevertheless
affirm the dismissal of this charge. There is no evidence that defendant
solicited anyone "to commit a felony" or "to do or omit to do an act
which if completed would constitute a felony."

Accordingly, we reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand this matter
to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do
not retain jurisdiction.

Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.

Kelly, J.

*(concurring in part and dissenting in part).* I respectfully disagree
with the majority's conclusion that the doctrine of "legal
impossibility" has never been adopted in Michigan. There is ample
evidence to the contrary in the case law of the state. Because "legal
impossibility" is a viable defense, I would affirm the Court of Appeals
decision affirming the circuit court's dismissal of attempted
distribution of obscene material to a minor. MCL 750.92, 722.675.

\- I would also find that legal impossibility, while a viable defense to
solicitation, is inapplicable to the charge of solicitation to commit
third-degree criminal sexual conduct in this case. MCL 750.157b(3)(a),
750.520d(l)(a). I agree with the majority's conclusion that there is no
evidence that defendant solicited anyone to commit csc-m. Therefore, I
would affirm the Court of Appeals decision affirming the circuit court's
dismissal of the solicitation charge, but on different grounds.

I. "LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY" IN MICHIGAN

The majority errs in concluding that "legal impossibility" has never
been adopted in Michigan. It focuses on language in Tinskey[^90]
pertaining to "legal impossibility" as a defense to attempt, but ignores
the reasoning of the decision. Viewing the forest as well as the trees,
one observes that the reasoning and the conclusion of the *Tinskey*
Court prove that it accepted the doctrine of "legal impossibility."

*Tinskey* held that the defendants could not be guilty of conspiracy to
commit abortion because the woman who was to be aborted was not
pregnant. *Tinskey, supra* at 109. The Court reasoned that the
Legislature, in enacting the statute, purposely required that conspiracy
to abort involve a pregnant woman. It thereby rejected prosecutions
where the woman was not pregnant. It concluded that the defendants in
*Tinskey* could not be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit abortion
because one of the elements of the crime, a pregnant woman, could not be
established.

Significantly, the *Tinskey* Court stated that "\[t\]he Legislature has
not, as to most other offenses, so similarly indicated that
impossibility is not a defense." *Id.*[^91] By this language, *Tinskey*
expressly recognized the existence of the "legal impossibility" defense
in the common law of this state. Even though the reference to "legal
impossibility" regarding the crime of attempt may be dictum, the later
statement regarding the "impossibility" defense was part of the
reasoning and conclusion in *Tinskey.* This Court recognized the
defense, even if it did not do so expressly concerning charges for
attempt or solicitation.

Moreover, Michigan common law[^92] is not limited to decisions from this
Court. The majority should not ignore decisions from the Court of
Appeals. That Court has accepted "legal impossibility" as a defense.

For example, in *People v Ng,* the Court of Appeals distinguished
between "factual impossibility" and "legal impossibility" in rejecting a
defendant's argument that he was not guilty of attempted murder. 156
Mich App 779, 786; 402 NW2d 500 (1986). It found that factual
impossibility is not a defense to a charge of attempted murder, but
observed that legal impossibility *is* a defense, citing *Tinskey.*
Similarly, in *People v Cain,* the court distinguished between "legal
impossibility" and a defense based on a claim of right. 238 Mich App 95,
117-119; 605 NW2d 28 (1999). It implicitly read *Tinskey* as
acknowledging the existence of the "legal impossibility" defense.[^93]
Accordingly, in this case, the Court of Appeals correctly considered
"legal impossibility" a viable defense.

H. INTERPRETATION OF THE ATTEMPT STATUTE

Even if "legal impossibility" were not part of Michigan's common law, I
would disagree with the majority's interpretation of the attempt
statute. It does not follow from the fact that the statute does not
expressly incorporate the concept of impossibility that the defense is
inapplicable.

Examination of the language of the attempt statute leads to a reasonable
inference that the Legislature did not intend to punish conduct that a
mistake of legal fact renders unprohibited. The attempt statute makes
illegal an ". . . attempt to *commit an offense prohibited by law* . . .
." MCL 750.92 (emphasis added). It does not make illegal an action not
prohibited by law. Hence, one may conclude, the impossibility of
completing the underlying crime can provide a defense to attempt.

This reasoning is supported by the fact that the attempt statute
codified the common-law rule regarding the elements of attempt. See
*People v Youngs,* 122 Mich 292, 293; 81 NW 114 (1899); *People v Webb,*
127 Mich 29, 31-32; 86 NW 406 (1901). At common law, "legal
impossibility" is a defense to attempt. *United States v Hsu,* 155 F3d
189, 199-200 (CA 3, 1998); Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law (2d ed),
§ 27.07\[B\], p 369; 21 Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law, § 178, p 254. Absent a
statute expressly abrogating "legal impossibility," this common-law rule
continues to provide a viable defense. *Bandfield v Bandfield,* 117 Mich
80, 82; 75 NW 287 (1898), rev'd in part on other grounds *Hosko v
Hosko,* 385 Mich 39; 187 NW2d 236 (1971).[^94]

This state's attempt statute, unlike the Model Penal Code and various
state statutes that follow it, does not contain language allowing for
consideration of a defendant's beliefs regarding "attendant
circumstances." Rather, it takes an "objective" view of criminality,
focusing on whether the defendant actually came close to completing the
prohibited act. 1 Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses, § 85(a), pp 423-424;
§ 85(b), p 426, n 22. The impossibility of completing the offense is
relevant to this objective approach because impossibility obviates the
state's "concern that the actor may cause or come close to causing the
harm or evil that the offense seeks to prevent." *Id.* at 424.

The majority's conclusion, that it is irrelevant whether it would be
impossible to have committed the completed offense, contradicts the
language used in the attempt statute. If an element of the offense
cannot be established, an accused cannot be found guilty of the
prohibited act. The underlying offense in this case, disseminating or
exhibiting sexual material to a minor, requires a minor recipient.
Because the dissemination was not to a minor, it is legally impossible
for defendant to have committed the prohibited act.

This Court should affirm the Court of Appeals decision, determining that
it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the charged
offense of attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor, MCL
750.92, 722.675.

m\. THE SOLICITATION STATUTE

I further disagree with the majority's conclusion that "legal
impossibility" is not a recognized defense to a solicitation charge. As
discussed above, the defense has been implicitly acknowledged in
Michigan's case law. The majority states that no authority supports the
proposition that "legal impossibility" is a defense to solicitation in
other jurisdictions. However, this fact is unremarkable in light of the
rarity with which the defense is invoked. Moreover, "the impossibility
issue can arise in all inchoate offenses," including solicitation.
Robinson, *supra* at § 85(f)(2), p 436.

The language of our solicitation statute demonstrates that an illegal
solicitation must concern an act that would constitute a felony if
completed. The statute states, "a person who solicits another person to
commit a felony, or who solicits another person to do or omit to do an
act which if completed would constitute a felony, is punishable as
follows . . . MCL 750.157b(3).

"Legal impossibility" would be a defense if the defendant's goal were
illegal but the offense incomplete due to the defendant's factual
mistake concerning the legal status of a relevant circumstance. See
Dressier, *supra* at § 27.07\[D\]\[3\]\[a\], p 373 (discussing "hybrid
legal impossibility"). In this case, defendant was mistaken regarding
the legal status of "Bekka," whom he believed to be a female minor but
who was actually a male adult.

However, defendant's factual mistake is irrelevant in analyzing the
charge of solicitation to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct.
Even if he had made his request to engage in sexual intercourse to a
fourteen-year-old girl, defendant, not the girl, would have violated the
csc-m statute. Therefore, I agree with the majority that defendant did
not solicit "Bekka" to commit an act that constituted a felony within
the meaning of the solicitation statute.

I note that this is the same conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals.
See 241 Mich App 102, 111; 614 NW2d 674 (2000). That Court erred,
however, in applying a "legal impossibility" analysis. It was not
defendant's mistake regarding the minority status of "Bekka" that is
significant. Rather, an element of the solicitation charge is missing.
"Legal impossibility" is, therefore, irrelevant under the facts of this
case. The solicitation charge was properly dismissed because the
prosecution could not prove all elements of the crime.

iv\. conclusion

As judges, we often decide cases involving disturbing facts. However
repugnant we personally find the criminal conduct charged, we must
decide the issues on the basis of the law. I certainly do not wish to
have child predators loose in society. However, I believe that neither
the law nor society is served by allowing the end of removing them from
society to excuse unjust means to accomplish it. In this case, defendant
raised a legal impossibility argument that is supported by Michigan case
law. The majority, in determining that legal impossibility is not a
viable defense in this state, ignores that law.

In keeping with precedent and legal authority, I would affirm the Court
of Appeals decision that it was legally impossible for defendant to
commit the charged offense of attempted distribution of obscene material
to a minor. Of course, if this view prevailed, defendant could still be
prosecuted for his alleged misconduct. He is to be tried on the most
serious of the charges, child sexually abusive activity, MCL 750.145c.

With regard to the solicitation charge, I disagree with the majority's
conclusion that "legal impossibility" is not a defense to solicitation.
However, the defense does not apply under the facts of this case. Even
if the facts had been as defendant believed, defendant did not solicit
"Bekka" to commit csc-m. Hence, an essential element of the solicitation
charge is missing. The charge was properly dismissed for that reason,
not because of the availability of the "legal impossibility" defense.

Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.

Taylor, J.

*(concurring in part and dissenting in part).* I agree with the
majority's recitation of the facts and its excellent analysis of why
"hybrid legal impossibility" should not be recognized as a defense to a
charge of attempt under MCL 750.92. Thus, I concur with parts i, n,
m(A), and m(B) of the majority opinion.

However, I respectfully dissent from the majority's analysis of the
solicitation of third-degree criminal sexual conduct (csc-m) charge in
part m(c). In my view, defendant may be charged with solicitation on the
basis of the evidence that he solicited a person whom he believed to be
a fourteen-year-old child to engage in an act of sexual penetration even
though a child victim of such an act of csc-m would not be guilty of
csc-m for "voluntarily" engaging in the act.

My difference with the majority is in its understanding of the
solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b(3). That section provides in
pertinent part:

> \[A\] person who solicits another person to commit a felony, *or who
> solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed
> would constitute a felony,* is punishable as follows: \.... \[Emphasis
> added.\]

As to the first clause ("a person who solicits another person to commit
a felony"), I agree with the majority that defendant cannot be
considered to have asked "Bekka" to *commit* the felony of csc-m in
violation of the solicitation statute because she cannot commit this
felony by engaging in sex with an adult. If an adult and a child aged
thirteen to fifteen engage in an act of "consensual" sexual penetration,
only the adult would be committing the crime of csc-m.[^95] Thus, an
adult who asks a fourteen-year-old child to engage in such an act cannot
be considered to have asked the child to commit csc-m. That is, the
solicitor has not breached the first clause in this section.

However, regarding the disjunctive clause that follows the first clause,
i.e., "or who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which
if completed would constitute a felony," this language is broader in
scope than merely prohibiting a person from soliciting another person to
commit a felony. I believe this language makes it unlawful to solicit
another person to do an act that if the act were completed would be a
felony. While this part of the statute surely is not as clear as it
could be,[^96] we must use statutory construction rules to give it
meaning. A primary rule is that we should avoid making the second clause
a nullity by giving it the same meaning as the first clause.[^97] Using
this tool, I conclude that the second clause means it is unlawful to
solicit another person to join with the solicitor in doing an act that
would constitute a felony whether the solicited party could be guilty of
the felony or not.

This all means that the first clause requires that the solicited act
would be a felony for which the solicitee could be charged. The second
clause encompasses situations where the solicitee could not be charged
with the felony, but the solicitor could be. This construction of the
statute gives viability to both clauses of the section at issue and is,
thus, in my view, not only preferable, but required.

The gist of the majority opinion, with regard to the solicitation issue,
is that the second phrase, i.e., "or who solicits another person to do
or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony," is
merely clarifying language to make clear that the Legislature did not
intend to require that the solicitee actually complete the solicited
felony in order for the solicitor to have violated the statute. That is,
the majority states that the second clause was "intended to make clear
that the solicited offense does not have to be completed." *Ante* at
170. Yet, the majority seems to acknowledge that the first clause is
also violated by a solicitation to commit a felony even if the felony is
never actually completed. This, then, makes the second clause a nullity.
It is that outcome that disciplined readers of statutes should avoid.

Also, the majority indicates that my interpretation is contrary to the
plain language of the statute because "it is the act of *'another*
person' that must, if completed, 'constitute a felony.' " *Ante* at 170.
I disagree because the majority's view on this point fails to give
meaning to the words "if completed." If, as the majority argues, the
conduct of the solicitee in itself must constitute a felony, then the
language of the second phrase has no different meaning than if it simply
referred to "an act which . . . would constitute a felony." The reason
is that, if the statutory language read "or who solicits another person
to do or omit to do an act which would constitute a felony," then it
might well be argued that the solicited person's contemplated "act,"
standing alone, must constitute a felony for the statute to be violated.
However, the "if completed" language allows for the imposition of
liability where completion of the solicited act by another person would
necessarily constitute a felony.

I agree with the majority that the current language of the solicitation
statute, MCL 750.157b, seems to be in large measure a reaction to this
Court's interpretation of the preceding statutory language at issue in
*People v Rehkopf,* 422 Mich 198; 370 NW2d 296 (1985). However, that
means only that the Legislature intended to include circumstances in
which the solicited felony is never actually committed within the scope
of the solicitation statute. Indeed, the language of the first clause
proscribing a person from merely asking another person "to commit a
felony" suffices, by its plain and unambiguous meaning, to accomplish
that goal. That does not mean, however, that the Legislature might not
have wanted to cover more situations inasmuch as it was acting to
broaden the scope of the statute. Accordingly, the discussion of
*Rehkopf* does not alter my view that, in keeping with the canon of
construction against rendering statutory language nugatory or
surplusage, the second clause must be taken as encompassing more than
the first clause, standing alone, does.

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, there was evidence
that defendant solicited "Bekka," believing "her" to be a
fourteen-year-old child, to engage in an act of sexual penetration with
him. In other words, defendant solicited "Bekka" to engage with him in
an act of sexual penetration between an adult and a fourteen-year-old
child. Thus, defendant solicited "Bekka" to do an act that, "if
completed" by the participation of defendant, would constitute the
felony of csc-m on defendant's part. Accordingly, I conclude that such a
solicitation falls within the range of conduct in the solicitation
statute's prohibition of soliciting another person "to do \... an act
which if completed would constitute a felony." MCL 750.157b(3).

Of course, I recognize that because "Bekka" was actually Deputy William
Liczbinski, an adult, the solicited person could not actually have
committed the act envisioned by defendant. However, that is immaterial.
There is nothing in the language of the pertinent part of the
solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b(3), that requires that it be possible
for the solicited person to carry out the conduct that is solicited in
order for the statute to be violated. Thus, consistent with the majority
opinion's rejection of the "legal impossibility" defense, I conclude
that it is immaterial that the deputy could not have carried out the
solicited act.

Accordingly, I agree with the majority's treatment of the attempted
distribution of obscene material to a minor charge. However, I would
also reverse the Court of Appeals with regard to the solicitation of
csc-m charge, and would remand to the circuit court for trial on that
charge.

JUSTICE BEATTY:

Benjamin P. Green appeals his convictions for criminal solicitation of a
minor[^\[1\]^](#X4540509db36e9f1619f5e535b4b8d5ace379b7c) and attempted
criminal sexual conduct (\"CSC\") with a minor in the
second-degree.[^\[2\]^](#Xdbf23551795945e6ee9519e20caf3d18713b78a) In
challenging his convictions, Green contends the trial judge erred in:
(1) denying his motion to dismiss the charge of criminal solicitation of
a minor on the ground the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and
vague; (2) denying his motions to dismiss and for a directed verdict on
the charge of attempted CSC with a minor in the second-degree; (3)
admitting certain photographs; and (4) denying his request for a jury
charge on attempted assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature
(\"ABHAN\"). We affirm.

## I. Factual/Procedural History

On October 13, 2006 at 5:38 p.m., Green entered a Yahoo! online chat
room under the screen name \"blak slyder\" and initiated an online chat
with \"lilmandy14sc\" (\"Mandy\"). On Mandy\'s profile page was a
picture of a female sitting on a bed. Unbeknownst to Green, Mandy was
actually an online persona created by Investigator Tommy Platt of the
Aiken County Sheriff\'s Office as part of the Internet Crimes Against
Children Task Force.

In response to Green\'s initial question, Mandy answered \"i hooked up
with a 16 year old.\" Green then asked Mandy, \"how young are you?\" to
which Mandy stated, \"14.\" Green countered that he was
\"21.\"[^\[3\]^](#X811ac74a14a20bc33f239f56d8fdfdd54808fb7) Immediately
thereafter, the chat turned sexual in nature with Green asking Mandy
whether she would have sex with him. During the chat, Green sent Mandy
two pictures of his penis and stated that he could \"show it to \[her\]
in person.\"[^\[4\]^](#X52d877792f39b778a5f4638003290fbeeef5e62) Green
then arranged to meet Mandy at 7:30 p.m. on a secluded road in Beech
Island, South Carolina, which is located in Aiken County.

When Green arrived at the predetermined location, he was met by several
law enforcement officers who arrested him. In response to the officers\'
questions, Green admitted that \"he was there to meet a 14-year-old
girl.\" A search of Green\'s vehicle revealed a cell phone, a bottle of
alcohol, two DVDs, condoms, male enhancement cream and drugs, and
handwritten directions to the location.

Subsequently, Green was indicted and ultimately convicted by a jury for
criminal solicitation of a minor and attempted CSC with a minor in the
second-degree. Green appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals.
This Court certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to
Rule 204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.

## II. Discussion

## **\[ ... \]**

## **\[ ... \]**

## B. Motions to Dismiss and for a Directed Verdict

Prior to trial, Green moved to dismiss the charged offenses. In support
of this motion and his directed verdict motion, Green claimed it was
legally impossible to \"carry out the criminal sexual conduct\" because
the alleged victim was not a minor but, rather, a fictitious person
created by Investigator Platt. During trial, Green also established that
the picture on Mandy\'s profile page was actually that of Lynda
Williamson, a twenty-four-year-old former probation officer who provided
the photograph to an investigator with the Aiken County Sheriff\'s
Office. Because the woman in the picture was \"over the age of
consent,\" Green claimed he could not be convicted of attempted CSC with
minor in the second-degree.

As an additional ground, Green asserted the State failed to prove his
specific intent to commit CSC with a minor in the second-degree and an
overt act in furtherance of the crime. During his argument, Green
pointed to the text of the online chat where he stated that he would not
pressure Mandy to do anything that she did not want to do and that she
could change her mind about having sex.

On appeal, Green reiterates these arguments in support of his contention
that the trial judge erred in denying his motions to dismiss and for a
directed verdict. In addition, Green elaborates on his claim of legal
impossibility. Citing United States v. Frazier, 560 F.2d 884 (8th Cir.
1977), Green explains that this defense applies \"where the
impossibility of a defendant\'s successfully committing a crime
eliminates the culpability of his having tried to do so.\" According to
this statement, Green claims he should not have been convicted of the
charged offenses as he \"could not commit criminal sexual conduct with a
fictitious person.\"

## 1. Legal Impossibility

\"\[L\]egal impossibility occurs when the actions that the defendant
performs or sets in motion, even if fully carried out as he or she
desires, would not constitute a crime, whereas factual impossibility
occurs when the objective of the defendant is proscribed by the criminal
law but a circumstance unknown to the actor prevents him or her from
bringing about that objective.\" 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law § 156
(2008). \"According to some authorities, legal impossibility is a
defense to a charge of attempt, but factual impossibility is not.\" Id.
In view of this distinction and Green\'s arguments, we have confined our
analysis of this issue to the defense of legal impossibility.

As we interpret Green\'s trial and appellate arguments, his claim of
legal impossibility encompasses both the solicitation charge and the CSC
charge. Specifically, the intent element in the solicitation statute and
the necessary intent for the attempted CSC charge warrant a similar
analysis with respect to Green\'s challenge that no actual minor was
involved. Accordingly, we address Green\'s claims as to both charges.

Section 16-15-342(D) definitively discounts Green\'s arguments with
respect to the solicitation charge as this provision states, \"It is not
a defense to a prosecution pursuant to this section, on the basis of
consent or otherwise, that the person reasonably believed to be under
the age of eighteen is a law enforcement agent or officer acting in an
official capacity.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 16-15-342(D) (Supp. 2011). Thus,
based on the plain language of the statute, the Legislature clearly
intended to eliminate the defense of impossibility as to the charge of
criminal solicitation of a minor if a law enforcement officer
impersonated the minor. State v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 659 S.E.2d 101
(2008) (recognizing that in interpreting statutes, appellate courts look
to the plain meaning of the statute and the intent of the Legislature).

Similarly, the fact that an actual minor was not the subject of Green\'s
intent did not preclude his prosecution and conviction for attempted CSC
with a minor in the second-degree.

A person is guilty of CSC with a minor in the second-degree if \"the
actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of
age or less but who is at least eleven years of age.\" S.C. Code Ann. §
16-3-655(B)(1) (Supp. 2011). \"A person who commits the common law
offense of attempt, upon conviction, must be punished as for the
principal offense.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 16-1-80 (2003). \"Thus, the
elements of attempted CSC with a minor in the second degree are: (1) an
attempt; (2) to engage in a sexual battery; (3) with a victim; (4) who
is fourteen years of age or less; (5) but who is at least eleven years
of age.\" Reid, 383 S.C. at 292, 679 S.E.2d at 197.

In discussing attempt crimes, this Court has stated, \"In the context of
an \`attempt\' crime, specific intent means that the defendant
consciously intended the completion of acts comprising the choate
offense.\" State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 397, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285
(2000). Accordingly, \"\[t\]o prove attempt, the State must prove that
the defendant had the *specific intent* to commit the underlying
offense, along with some *overt act,* beyond mere preparation in
furtherance of the intent.\" State v. Reid, 393 S.C. 325, 329, 713
S.E.2d 274, 276 (2011) (emphasis in the original).

Based on the above-outlined definitions, we find Green\'s actions were
sufficient to prove the offense of attempted CSC with a minor in the
second-degree. As noted, an attempt crime does not require the
completion of the object offense. Thus, Green was not required to
complete the sexual battery in order to be prosecuted and convicted of
the offense. Accordingly, the fact that the intended victim was not an
actual minor was irrelevant as the State was only required to prove
Green had the specific intent to commit a sexual battery on *a victim*
between the ages of eleven and fourteen years old coupled with some
overt act toward the commission of the offense. See State v. Curtiss, 65
P.3d 207 (Idaho Ct. App. 2002) (holding that impossibility did not
constitute a defense to charge of attempted lewd conduct with a minor
under the age of sixteen in a case where detective posed as a
fourteen-year-old girl in online chat room); Hix v. Commonwealth, 619
S.E.2d 80 (Va. 2005) (holding that the fact defendant was communicating
with an adult law enforcement officer posing as a child was not a
defense to the charge of attempted indecent liberties with a minor).

A decision to this effect is consistent with our state\'s limited
jurisprudence regarding Internet sex crimes. **\[ ... \]**

Finally, other state jurisdictions have concluded that a defendant may
be prosecuted for criminal solicitation of a minor, as well as attempted
sexual offenses, where the online persona is an undercover officer and
not an actual minor. **\[ ... \]**

## C. Sufficiency of the Evidence As to Specific Intent and Overt Act in Furtherance of Attempted CSC with a Minor

Finding that an actual minor was not required for the prosecution of the
charge of attempted CSC with a minor, the question becomes whether the
State proved that Green possessed the requisite intent and that he
engaged in some overt act in furtherance of the charge.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we
conclude the trial judge properly denied Green\'s motion for a directed
verdict as to the charge of attempted CSC with a minor in the
second-degree. Green clearly expressed his specific intent to have a
sexual encounter with Mandy, a fourteen-year-old female. A review of the
online chat reveals that Green was not dissuaded by the fact that Mandy
stated she was fourteen years old. Instead, Green continued the sexually
explicit conversation and sent Mandy pictures of his genitals.

In furtherance of his specific intent, Green committed an overt act in
orchestrating a meeting for the sexual encounter. Green asked Mandy
whether her parents would let her out after dark and whether he could
meet her at her home. Ultimately, Green arranged to meet Mandy on a
secluded street that night at a specific time. Green then traveled to
the predetermined location where he was arrested and found to be in
possession of alcohol, condoms, and male enhancement products.
Accordingly, the trial judge properly submitted the charge to the jury.
See State v. Reid, 393 S.C. 325, 713 S.E.2d 274 (2011) (finding
attempted second-degree CSC with a minor charge was properly submitted
to the jury where appellant, who through a chat with an online persona
created by a law enforcement officer, clearly communicated his desire to
have a sexual encounter with a fourteen-year-old girl, arranged to meet
the fictitious minor at a designated place and time, and travelled to
that location); State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648
(2006) (recognizing that if there is any direct evidence or any
substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the
guilt of the accused, the appellate court must find the case was
properly submitted to the jury).

## **\[ ... \]**

## III. Conclusion

In conclusion, we affirm Green\'s convictions for criminal solicitation
of a minor and attempted CSC with a minor in the second-degree as: (1)
the criminal solicitation of a minor statute is not unconstitutionally
overbroad or vague; (2) the use of a law enforcement officer to
impersonate a minor victim was legally permissible to support both
convictions; (3) Green had the requisite specific intent and committed
an overt act in furtherance of the CSC charge under Reid; (4) the
challenged photographs were relevant and their probative value
outweighed any prejudicial effect; and (5) there was no evidence to
support Green\'s request to charge attempted ABHAN.

Notes and Questions - Legal Impossibility

 

1.  Consider the statutory analyses in both the majority and the
    dissent. Which argument do you find more persuasive?

2.  Factual and legal impossibility defined. While many jurisdictions
    have done away with the distinction between factual and legal
    impossibility, it is still important to understand the difference
    between the two. 

[United States v.
Oviedo](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia26ac9fe90b811d9a707f4371c9c34f0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0),
525 F.2d 881 (5th Cir. 1976) defines the two concepts:

"Legal impossibility occurs when the actions which the defendant
performs or sets in motion, even if fully carried out as he desires,
would not constitute a crime. Factual impossibility occurs when the
objective of the defendant is proscribed by the criminal law but a
circumstance unknown to the actor prevents him from bringing about that
objective."

Kyle S. Brodie provides an example in his article [The Obviously
Impossible Attempt: A Proposed Revision to the Model Penal
Code](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Icf4a54615a9a11dbbe1cf2d29fe2afe6/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad6ad3a000001738d1ef39d982645bc%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIcf4a54615a9a11dbbe1cf2d29fe2afe6%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=c9dda4f56804c8426c1e26b273b74f29&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=7&sessionScopeId=cc399cac5e8f4f6d526b3ca0ea7a19b31596ac29aebc0ddbb72db783ca4d533e&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29),
15 N. Ill. U. L. Rev. 237, 238--39 (1995):

For example, if a person were to hold an illicit poker game in a Las
Vegas apartment, thinking and intending to break a law against gambling,
no attempt has been committed, because it is impossible to gamble
illegally in Las Vegas. This is often called 'pure' legal impossibility.
If, however, a person were to possess a package which he believed to be
narcotics, but was in fact talcum powder, then the attempt to possess
narcotics would be only factually impossible. Therefore the
impossibility of the attempt would be no defense.

3.  Impossibility criticisms. In [The Obviously Impossible Attempt: A
    Proposed Revision to the Model Penal
    Code](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Icf4a54615a9a11dbbe1cf2d29fe2afe6/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad6ad3a000001738d1ef39d982645bc%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIcf4a54615a9a11dbbe1cf2d29fe2afe6%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=c9dda4f56804c8426c1e26b273b74f29&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=7&sessionScopeId=cc399cac5e8f4f6d526b3ca0ea7a19b31596ac29aebc0ddbb72db783ca4d533e&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29),
    Brodie expands on the aforementioned passage with criticisms of the
    impossibility concepts: 

In most cases, however, courts could not clearly determine whether the
defendant\'s attempt was legally or factually impossible. The
distinction was so ineffective that different courts often found the
nearly identical action either factually or legally impossible. For
example, a person who shoots a stuffed deer, thinking it to be alive, is
not guilty of an attempt to shoot a deer out of season. But a person who
shoots into an empty bed, believing that it is occupied, is guilty of
attempted murder. Despite the different results, these two cases are
logically indistinguishable. In both instances the attemptor has fired a
gun at a target, but has been mistaken about what that target
represented. In the first instance the hunter thought the deer was
alive, while in the second the actor thought the bed was occupied.

4.  In [People v.
    Jaffe](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I3c4dceb0d86c11d99439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad6ad3a000001738d4bf2e19dfeb0e0%3FNav%3DCASE%26fragmentIdentifier%3DI3c4dceb0d86c11d99439b076ef9ec4de%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=6d50c9dc192043cc713e465f977e00df&list=CASE&rank=1&sessionScopeId=cc399cac5e8f4f6d526b3ca0ea7a19b31596ac29aebc0ddbb72db783ca4d533e&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29),
    185 N.Y. 497 (1906), the defendant received goods that he thought to
    be stolen and was subsequently convicted of attempted receipt of
    stolen property. Upon appeal, the conviction was overturned because
    of legal impossibility. Do you understand why?

The Court proceeds to explain:

The crucial distinction between the case before us and the pickpocket
cases, and others involving the same principle, lies not in the
possibility or impossibility of the commission of the crime, but in the
fact that, in the present case, the act, which it was doubtless the
intent of the defendant to commit would not have been a crime if it had
been consummated. If he had actually paid for the goods which he desired
to buy and received them into his possession, he would have committed no
offense under section 550 of the Penal Code, because the very definition
in that section of the offense of criminally receiving \[stolen\]
property makes it an essential element of the crime that the accused
shall have known the property to have been stolen or wrongfully
appropriated in such a manner as to constitute larceny. This knowledge
being a material ingredient of the offense it is manifest that it cannot
exist unless the property has in fact been stolen or larcenously
appropriated. No man can know that to be so which is not so in truth and
in fact. He may believe it to be so but belief is not enough under this
statute.

Do you agree with the Jaffe court's reasoning? 

5.  Model Penal Code approach to impossibility. Under the MPC, hybrid
    (legal plus factual) impossibility is not a valid defense. 

As Ken Levy notes in his article, [It\'s Not Too Difficult: A Plea to
Resurrect the Impossibility
Defense](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ie1a103f5b3f611e498db8b09b4f043e0/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad740350000017390eac8a7ba20dbac%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIe1a103f5b3f611e498db8b09b4f043e0%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=32fa6b779d861b4bb5ef9dae24079c9a&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=3&sessionScopeId=5322d1ea5f366b01ef878f6c3bebbb5ebb59b677792f3c949020cedf3994865a&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29),
45 N.M. L. Rev. 225, 226--27 (2014):

The authors of the MPC and its followers worried that courts were
falling for too many defendants\' bogus impossibility claims. These
defendants had typically tried to commit a crime such as selling
controlled substances or committing statutory rape and failed only
because the people whom they had solicited were undercover officers. The
MPC and its followers reasoned that even though the undercover officers
made it impossible for the crimes to be consummated, the defendants
should still have been found guilty of attempt on the grounds that they
were genuinely guilty of attempting to commit serious crimes and the
standard law-enforcement practice of using undercover officers to catch
criminals should be encouraged rather than discouraged.

Do you agree with the MPC authors' concerns about the hybrid
impossibility defense? Do you think the impossibility defense should be
abolished entirely? Now, apply [MPC
§5.01](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.01&__lrTS=20200725175603501&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29)
to the facts in Thousand. Does the outcome of the case change? 

6.  More on the MPC. In the Model Penal Code and Commentaries
    [§5.01](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.01&__lrTS=20200725175603501&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29)
    cmt. 3(b), at 315--16 (1985), the authors of the MPC developed their
    argument for the abolition of impossibility as a defense. They
    argue:

"Insofar as it has not rested on conceptual tangles that have been
largely independent of policy considerations, the defense of
impossibility seems to have been employed to serve a number of
functions. First, it has been used to verify criminal purpose; if the
means selected were absurd, there is good ground for doubting that the
actor really planned to commit a crime. Similarly, if the defendant's
conduct, objectively viewed, is ambiguous, there may be ground for
doubting the firmness of his purpose to commit a criminal offense. A
general defense of impossibility is, however, an inappropriate way of
assuring that the actor has a true criminal purpose. \* \* \*

\[Another\] consideration that has been advanced in support of an
impossibility defense is the view that the criminal law need not take
notice of conduct that is innocuous, the element of impossibility
preventing any dangerous proximity to the completed crime. The law of
attempts, however, should be concerned with manifestations of dangerous
character as well as with preventive arrests; the fact that particular
conduct may not create an actual risk of harmful consequences, though it
would if the circumstances were as the defendant believed them to be,
should not therefore be conclusive. The innocuous character of the
particular conduct becomes relevant only if the futile endeavor itself
indicates a harmless personality, so that immunizing the conduct from
liability would not result in exposing society to a dangerous person."

7.  Further criticisms. Recall the Jaffe case from Note 4. Consider
    Arnold N. Enker's take in [Impossibility in Criminal
    Attempts---Legality and the Legal
    Process](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1857&context=mlr),
    53 Minn. L. Rev. 665, 674 (1969):

"Those who would eliminate the defense of legal impossibility from the
legal lexicon and would convict Jaffe of attempted possession of stolen
goods because he thought they were stolen presumably would convict any
other defendant of the same crime with respect to goods that had never
been stolen if it could be proved that the defendant thought they were
stolen. Having dispensed with the need for establishing the circumstance
that the goods are stolen, they must permit this result if there is
evidence of guilty belief. Assume two cases in which the sole direct
evidence of the defendant\'s alleged belief that the goods are stolen is
a confession or the testimony of an informer or an accomplice. In one
case the goods possessed are in fact stolen; in the other they are not.
It is reasonably clear that most of us would rest easier with a
conviction in the first case than in the second although we might have a
difficult time articulating reasons for this distinction. Some of the
reasons for this distinction are explored below, but it may also be that
possession of stolen goods furnishes some evidence of belief that they
are stolen while, clearly, possession of goods not in fact stolen
furnishes no reason to believe that the defendant thought they were
stolen. \* \* \*

The draftsmen of the Model Penal Code have argued that while eliminating
legal impossibility as a defense, the Code adequately takes care of
these problems by its separate provision requiring that the defendant\'s
act corroborate his mens rea.. But the Model Penal Code\'s requirement
that the act corroborate the mens rea applies only to cases in the
preparation-attempt continuum. Cases such as Jaffe and Lady Eldon are
covered by a separate provision which provides that where the defendant
does any act which would constitute a crime under the circumstances as
he thought them to be, he is guilty of an attempt. The corroboration
requirement of section 5.01(2) does not apply to this section. Perhaps
the draftsmen assumed that doing the act defined in the substantive
crime will always supply at least as much corroboration of mens rea as
is present in the substantive crime itself. If so, what they have failed
to see is that the act in its narrow sense of the defendant\'s physical
movements can be perfectly innocent in itself-possession of goods,
bringing goods into the country-and that what gives the act character as

"\[I\]t should \* \* \* be noted how unlikely it is that persons will be
prosecuted on the basis of admissions alone; the person who has behaved
in a wholly innocuous way is not a probable subject of criminal
proceedings. So the issue posed over Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) is
more theoretical than practical."

Which of the two passages do you find more persuasive? Drafters of the
MPC believe that a "person who has behaved in a wholly innocuous way" is
not likely to be prosecuted. What do you think of this statement? Does
it support or detract from the argument of allowing impossibility as a
defense?

 

For the following hypotheticals, read through the fact pattern and
determine whether or not the defense lies in pure legal impossibility,
factual impossibility, or hybrid legal impossibility. 

1.  Jayesh was walking around town searching for a car to steal. He came
    across a Chevy Cobalt and noticed that the doors were unlocked and
    the key was in the ignition. He got in the car and drove away,
    without noticing the sign in the rear window that stated "free car."
    He is charged with attempted car theft. 

2.  Verena wants to assassinate the President while he is at Camp David.
    She sets up a sniper rifle outside the camp, and fires several shots
    into a few of the windows, believing the president to be in one of
    the rooms. The President was in the White House that day. Is Verena
    guilty of attempted assassination of the President?

3.  Gunda's wife Polymnia is on trial for homicide. During the trial,
    the evidence overwhelmingly points to Polymnia's guilt. Gunda
    decides to take matters into her own hands, and accosts a person she
    believes to be a juror in the bathroom. She tells the person, "I
    believe my wife is innocent, and I have \$1,000 that says you do
    too." This person bears a resemblance to someone on the jury, but is
    not actually a juror. Gunda is charged with attempted bribery of a
    juror.

Commonwealth v. McCloskey

 

Superior Court of Pennsylvania

234 Pa. Super. 577

Appeal, No. 1412

1975-06-24

Submitted March 17, 1975.

Before Watkins, P. J., Jacobs, Hoffman, Cercone, Price, Van der Voort,
and Spaeth, JJ.

*Francis P. Burns,* Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.

No appearance entered nor brief submitted for Commonwealth, appellee.

Opinion by

Hoffman, J.,

Appellant contends that the Commonwealth's evidence at trial was
insufficient to sustain his conviction for an attempted prison
breach.[^98]

At the time of the alleged offense, appellant was serving a one- to
three-years sentence for larceny in the Luzerne County Prison. At about
12:15 a.m., on December 26, 1972, James Larson, a Guard Supervisor at
the prison, heard an alarm go off that indicated that someone was
attempting an escape in the recreation area of the prison. The alarm was
designed so that it could be heard in the prison office, but not in the
courtyard. Larson immediately contacted Guards Szmulo and Banik.
Initially, the guards checked the prison population, but found no one
missing. The three men then conducted a search of the area where the
alarm had been "tripped". Near the recreation yard between two wings of
the prison, they found one piece of barbed wire that had been cut. In
addition, Guard Szmulo found a laundry bag filled with civilian
clothing. The bags are issued by the prison and are marked with a
different number for each prisoner. A check revealed that the bag
belonged to appellant.

At approximately 5:15 a.m., on December 26, the appellant voluntarily
approached Larson. Appellant had spent that night on the nine p.m. to
five a.m. shift at work in the boiler room, situated near the point
where the alarm had been triggered. Appellant explained to Larson that
"I was gonna make a break last night, but I changed my mind because I
thought of my family, and I got scared of the consequences." Appellant
testified at trial that he had become depressed prior to his decision to
escape because he had been denied a Christmas furlough on December 24,
1972. His testimony at trial was consistent with Larson's version of the
episode: "\... in the yard, I realized that I had shamed my family
enough, and I did not want to shame them any more \.... So I went back
to the boiler room and continued working."

On April 18, 1973, the grand jury returned an indictment charging the
appellant with prison breach. Appellant went to trial on May 25, 1973,
before a judge sitting without a jury and was found guilty of attempted
prison breach. Thereafter, appellant filed motions in arrest of judgment
and for a new trial. Motions were heard in October, 1973, and denied on
June 10, 1974, by the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas en banc. This
appeal followed.

A criminal attempt is defined as "an overt act done in pursuance of an
intent to do a specific thing, tending to the end by falling short of
complete accomplishment of it. In law, the definition must have this
further qualification, that the overt act must be sufficiently proximate
to the intended crime to form one of the natural series of acts which
the intent requires for its full execution. *So long as the acts are
confined to preparation only, and can be abandoned before any
transgression of the law or of others' rights,* they are within the
sphere of intent and do not amount to attempts." *Commonwealth v.
Eagan,* 190 Pa. 10, 21-22 (1899) (Emphasis added). Thus, we must locate
the line between an act which is mere preparation and one that is
sufficiently proximate to be labelled an attempt.

A review of the cases on the law of attempt indicates that "\[i\]t is
difficult to formulate any precise rule about how close the overt act
must come to the accomplishment of the ultimate criminal result." 21 Am.
Jur. 2d Criminal Law §111. "At what point does a potential criminal pass
beyond preparation and become guilty of an attempt? Among the various
tests suggested or applied are: the last act doctrine, holding that the
defendant will not be guilty of an attempt until he does the last act
necessary to the commission of a crime; Justice Holmes'
dangerous-proximity test which focusses on both the dangerousness of the
crime and the nearness to which the defendant has come to accomplishing
it; and the movie camera test, which disregards the defendant's
declarations of intent and instead focusses on the extent to which his
acts demonstrate a specific intent or commitment to the criminal
purpose." White, *The Inchoate Crimes Provisions of* *the New
Pennsylvania Penal Code,* 35 Pitt. L. Rev. 235, 237-38 (1973). Professor
White suggests that the law in Pennsylvania approximates the last act
doctrine, Id.

*Commonwealth v. Willard,* 179 Pa. Superior Ct. 368, 116 A. 2d 751
(1955), represents the broadest statement of what constitutes mere
preparation. In *Willard,* this Court reversed the appellant's
conviction for attempt to perform an abortion. The Commonwealth proved
that the appellant accepted \$160 from a police undercover agent, told
her to undress and to lie on a bed equipped for the operation, left the
room momentarily and returned with surgical instruments. At that point,
the police agent and her "paramour", stationed in the next room,
arrested the appellant. These acts were held not "sufficiently close or
proximate to the completed crime so that it could be said that they were
done in pursuance of the intent to commit the crime as distinguished
from mere preparation to commit the crime." 179 Pa. Superior Ct. at 371,
116 A.2d at 752-753.[^99]

In *Commonwealth v. Eagan,* supra, a seminal case on the law of
attempts, the Court noted that ". . . the acts of the prisoner in going
to \[the victim's\] place and watching his house, and even of preparing
the rope to tie him, while undoubtedly done in pursuance of the intent,
did not go beyond mere preparation, and had the intent been abandoned at
this point, an indictment for an attempt to commit robbery or burglary
could not have been sustained. But the moment a blow was struck on \[the
victim\] the first step of the actual crime had been taken, and the
intent was merged in the attempt. Subsequent abandonment might prevent
the completion of the crime, but could not save from the consequences of
acts done in the attempt." 190 Pa. at 22.

We recently dealt with an attempted prison breach in *Commonwealth v.
Skipper,* 222 Pa. Superior Ct. 242, 294 A. 2d 780 (1972). In *Skipper,*
appellant approached a fellow prisoner and asked him to procure hacksaw
blades to be used in an escape attempt. The fellow prisoner,
Commonwealth's witness at trial, worked in a bakery in a day release
program and was to hide the blades in loaves of bread bound for the
prison kitchen. Prison officials intercepted a note that the
Commonwealth's witness attempted to pass to a third prisoner, one
Schaef-fer, who was to pay him for smuggling the blades into the prison.
Subsequently, prison officials caught Schaeffer attempting to go over
the prison wall. They found one of the smuggled blades on Schaeffer. A
"shake-down" of the prison uncovered two additional blades in
appellant's cell. We reversed appellant's conviction, noting that
"discovery of the hacksaw blades in appellant's cell did no more than
interrupt appellant's alleged plan in a preparatory stage. If the
hacksaw blades were in fact procured by the appellant for use in an
intended prison breach, appellant would have had sufficient time to
withdraw before the commission of the offense." 222 Pa. Superior Ct. at
245, 294 A. 2d at 781.

In the instant case, the evidence on the record indicates that appellant
scaled a fence within the prison walls that led to the recreation yard
and then to the prison wall. Appellant testified that "I went over the
fence. I was in the yard.

> "Q. Well, when you say you went over the fence, this is still in the
> prison?
>
> "A. This is still in the prison, yes, sir. . ."

The Commonwealth's evidence supports the appellant's claim that he went
only as far as the yard before giving up his plan to escape. Guard
Szmulo testified that "We checked the trip wire. We couldn't find
nothing broke. And then when I got to the gate that goes into the
recreation yard between center and left wing, I found one barbed wire
was cut." Thus appellant was still within the prison, still only
contemplating a prison breach, and not yet attempting the act. He was
thus in a position to abandon the criminal offense of attempted prison
breach voluntarily, thereby exonerating himself from criminal
responsibility.

Judgment of sentence is vacated and appellant ordered discharged on the
conviction of attempted prison breach.

Watkins, P. J., and Jacobs and Spaeth, JJ., join in this opinion.

Van dee Voort, J., concurs in the result.

Concurring Opinion by

Cercone, J.:

I agree with the majority that appellant's conviction for attempted
prison breach should not be permitted to stand. However, I disagree with
the basis for the majority's conclusion, that the acts done by appellant
prior to his decision to abandon his escape were insufficient to
constitute an attempt. I would have found little difficulty, for
instance, in affirming appellant's conviction had he been apprehended by
the guards immediately after he had snipped the barbed wire and crossed
the inner fence. To hold otherwise is to require that prisoners must
literally be plucked from the prison wall before their conduct may be
characterized as attempted prison breach.

I respectfully suggest that the majority has fallen into a trap
peculiarly common to the law of attempts. As Professor Perkins has
stated in discussing when conduct ceases to be merely preparatory and
becomes perpetration:

> "The preparatory-perpetrating dichotomy is useful in discussing
> situations of a rather general nature, but the actual dividing line
> between the two is shadowy in the extreme. There is reason to believe
> that *in close cases the decision is based wpon other considerations*
> and that the label attached is that appropriate to the conclusion
> reached --- after it is reached." R. Perkins, Criminal Law 561 (2d ed.
> 1969). \[Emphasis added.\]

The "other consideration" which has influenced the majority herein is
appellant's voluntary abandonment of his escape plan. In my opinion,
appellant's abandonment of his plan is a sufficient defense to the crime
of attempted prison breach and should be recognized as such.

As a practical matter, it has long been recognized that plans
voluntarily abandoned are less likely to be found to be attempts than
are plans carried to the same point, but interrupted by the apprehension
of the perpetrators. Unfortunately, in jurisdictions where voluntary
abandonment or renunciation of a criminal purpose has not been
recognized as an affirmative defense, the courts have sought to give
effect to the defendant's abandonment, *sub silentio,* by characterizing
his conduct as "preparatory." See Model Penal Code §501, comment 19 at
p. 70 (Tent. Draft No. 10, 1958). That is precisely the error which the
majority has made in the instant case. The difficulty with this position
is that, with regard to the preparation-perpetration dichotomy, it
breeds results superficially inconsistent. If voluntary abandonment is
to be given effect in attempt cases, it should not be done covertly.

For some time the trend in the law has been to recognize voluntary
abandonment as an affirmative and complete defense to a charge of
attempt, despite the exhortations to the contrary by some
commentators.[^100] *Id.* And, in following this trend our legislature
substantially adopted section 5.01 of the Model Penal Code in drafting
the attempt provisions in our recently enacted Crimes Code.[^101] Our
Code now recognizes that abandonment under circumstances indicating
voluntariness, is a complete defense to a charge of attempt. Appellant,
however, was charged under our old Penal Code which did not speak to
whether voluntary abandonment was a defense to a charge of
attempt.[^102]

In one of the first cases ever decided by this court, we stated:

> "In the case under consideration, Johanna Tadriek left her mother's
> house, intending to steal the prosecutor's money, entered the house of
> the prosecutor and seated herself on the bed where she knew the money
> was concealed. Nothing remained to be done save to insert her hand and
> secure the money. Each of the three acts mentioned was intended to be,
> and actually was, a step towards the consummation of her felonious
> purpose. Taken together and in connection with the uninterrupted
> intent existing in her mind, we are compelled to hold that they
> constituted an attempt at larceny which would have been punishable had
> she gone no further. If the offense of larceny were not completed, we
> must assume, from the evidence, that the failure was not owing to a
> change of purpose, which of course would leave her guiltless, but to
> extraneous circumstances, over which she had no control. An overt act
> is one which manifests an intention to commit the crime: Bouvier's
> L.D. 267. It need not be the last proximate act prior to the
> consummation of the attempted crime, if the latter be a felony: Uhl v.
> Commonwealth, 6 Grattan, 706; 1 Bish. Crim. Law, sec. 764."
> *Commonwealth v. Tadrick,* 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 555, 566 (1896)
> \[Emphasis added.\]

It is clear that this court long ago perceived voluntary abandonment to
be an affirmative defense to the crime of attempt; and, I have not been
referred to any Pennsylvania authority which persuades me that this
court's implicit conclusion was then erroneous, nor any authority to
indicate that this court's observation in *Tadrick* has not withstood
the test of time. On the contrary, as aforementioned, voluntary
abandonment is now recognized in Pennsylvania as a statutory defense to
an attempt charge.

Sound policy reasons also underlie the recognition of voluntary
abandonment as an affirmative defense. As the drafters of the Model
Penal Code have pointed out, the defense of complete and permanent
abandonment should be allowed because voluntary abandonment negates the
conclusion that the accused continues to be dangerous; and, the
knowledge that voluntary abandonment exonerates one from criminal
liability provides a motive to desist prior to completion of the crime.
Model Penal Code §5.01, comment 19 at pp. 71-72 (Tent. Draft No. 10,
1958). See also Wechsler, Jones & Korn, The Treatment of Inchoate Crimes
in the Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute: Attempt,
Solicitation and Conspiracy, 61 Co-lum. L. Rev. 571, 617 (1961).[^103]

Thus, I have concluded that the law in Pennsylvania recognized voluntary
abandonment as an affirmative defense even prior to the adoption of the
Crimes Code. In any event, the trend in the United States is so
profoundly in favor of such a defense that we should have recognized its
existence in the instant case even had the Crimes Code not been enacted.
Furthermore, I think it would be erroneous to construe the attempts
provision of the Crimes Code as somehow implying that the law was
otherwise prior to the Code's adoption. On the contrary, I think the
adoption of that provision only fortifies the conclusion I have reached
herein.

Therefore, I would not rest the decision of this case on the basis that
appellant's acts prior to renunciation of his criminal purpose were
merely preparatory; for, as has my brother, Judge PRICE, I have
concluded that appellant had clearly gone further than preparation.
Rather, I would rest the instant decision on appellant's unequivocal and
undisputedly voluntary abandonment of his criminal purpose. Thus, I only
concur in the result reached by the majority herein.

Spaeth, J., joins in this opinion.

Dissenting Opinion by

Price, J.:

I cannot agree with the majority's conclusion that appellant's acts were
confined to preparation and contemplation, therefore, I must
respectfully dissent.

The facts are fully set forth in the majority opinion and need not be
repeated. The evidence is sufficient to establish that appellant went
over a forbidden fence, albeit still within the physical confines of the
prison, cut a piece of barbed wire and tripped the alarm system designed
and equipped to alert the authorities to attempts at prison breach. Any
one of these three acts \"would, in my opinion, take appellant beyond
preparation and contemplation. Accordingly, there is more than
sufficient evidence to sustain appellant's conviction.

I would affirm the judgment of sentence.

Notes and Questions - Commonwealth v. McCloskey

 

1.  In [People v.
    Kimball](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=Y&pubNum=0000595&sernum=1981146541&__lrTS=20200727200428516&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&bhcp=1&CobaltRefresh=72852)
    109 Mich. App. 273, 311 N.W.2d 343 (1981), the court makes an
    argument against the abandonment defense. It indicates that:

"\[V\]oluntary abandonment is not a defense where the elements of an
attempt are already established, although it may be relevant to the
issue of whether defendant possessed the requisite intent in the first
place. Under this view, once a defendant has gone so far as to have
committed a punishable attempt, the crime is 'complete' and he or she
cannot then abandon the crime and avoid liability anymore than a thief
can abandon a larceny by returning the stolen goods."

Do you agree or disagree with this court's argument? Should abandonment
be permitted as a defense? 

 

At what point in the perpetration of a crime can an individual no longer
use abandonment as a defense? How are these abandonments distinguishable
from attempt, if at all? Consider these questions as you read the
hypotheticals. Use MPC 5.01(4).

1.  Azad stole a jacket from a store. The next day, he returned the
    jacket to the store. Can Azad use abandonment as a defense?

2.  Demetrios breaks into a house with the intent to steal the contents
    inside. Once inside the house, he realizes that he does not want to
    burglarize the house and leaves. Can Demetrios use abandonment as a
    defense? 

3.  Gwenda shoots her boyfriend, Nogah, in a fit of anger. In the
    moment, she intended to kill him, but several minutes after firing
    the gun, Gwenda has a change of heart and calls an ambulance. The
    ambulance is able to rush Nogah to the hospital and provide adequate
    treatment, which saves his life. Is Gwenda guilty of attempted
    murder? Can she use abandonment as a defense?

4.  Jaylen decided to rob a bank with a gun. They walk into the bank,
    clutching the gun in their jacket pocket. Without pulling out the
    gun, Jaylen shouts, "Everybody, listen up!" Once everyone's
    attention is on them, Jaylen decides they don't want to rob the bank
    and they walk out. Is Jaylen guilty of attempted bank robbery? Can
    they use abandonment as a defense?

Pre-Attempt Conduct

 

Solicitation and conspiracy are two inchoate offences that punish
criminal conduct before it reaches the "attempt" stage, when the actors
are merely preparing to commit the target offenses. Lawmakers have long
endeavored to penalize those who threaten criminal acts, with varying
degrees of success. In recent years, facilitated by the use of emerging
technology (Twitter, Facebook, etc), the challenge of policing "threats"
has intensified. Consider the following case.

the opinion of the Court.

 

Federal law makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any
communication containing any threat \... to injure the person of
another." [18 U.S.C. §
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5).
Petitioner was convicted of violating this provision under instructions
that required the jury to find that he communicated what a reasonable
person would regard as a threat. The question is whether the statute
also requires that the defendant be aware of the threatening nature of
the communication, and---if not---whether the First Amendment requires
such a showing.

I.                

A

Anthony Douglas Elonis was an active user of the social networking Web
site Facebook. \* \* \* In May 2010, Elonis's wife of nearly seven years
left him, taking with her their two young children. Elonis began
"listening to more violent music" and posting self-styled "rap" lyrics
inspired by the music. \*\*\* Eventually, Elonis changed the user name
on his Facebook page from his actual name to a rap-style nom de plume,
"Tone Dougie," to distinguish himself from his "on-line persona." The
lyrics Elonis posted as "Tone Dougie" included graphically violent
language and imagery. This material was often interspersed with
disclaimers that the lyrics were "fictitious," with no intentional
"resemblance to real persons." Elonis posted an explanation to another
Facebook user that "I'm doing this for me. My writing is
therapeutic.".\* \* \*

  

Elonis's posts frequently included crude, degrading, and violent
material about his soon-to-be ex-wife. \* \* \*Elonis posted an
adaptation of a satirical sketch that he and his wife had watched
together. In the actual sketch, called "It's Illegal to Say \...," a
comedian explains that it is illegal for a person to say he wishes to
kill the President, but not illegal to explain that it is illegal for
him to say that. When Elonis posted the script of the sketch, however,
he substituted his wife for the President. \* \* \*

 

After viewing some of Elonis's posts, his wife felt "extremely afraid
for \[her\] life.". A state court granted her a three-year
protection-from-abuse order against Elonis (essentially, a restraining
order).. Elonis referred to the order in another post on his "Tone
Dougie" page\[.\]\* \* \*

At the bottom of this post was a link to the Wikipedia article on
"Freedom of speech."

 

That same month, interspersed with posts about a movie Elonis liked and
observations on a comedian's social commentary, Elonis posted an entry
\[about a school shooting, which led to\] FBI Agent Denise Stevens
\[creating\] a Facebook account to monitor his online activity.*. *After
the post about a school shooting, Agent Stevens and her partner visited
Elonis at his house. Following their visit, during which Elonis was
polite but uncooperative, Elonis posted another \[threatening\] entry on
his Facebook page, called "Little Agent Lady," which led to Count
Five\[.\] \* \* \* 

B

A grand jury indicted Elonis for making threats to injure patrons and
employees of the park, his estranged wife, police officers, a
kindergarten class, and an FBI agent, all in violation of [18 U.S.C. §
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5).
In the District Court, Elonis moved to dismiss the indictment for
failing to allege that he had intended to threaten anyone. The District
Court denied the motion, holding that Third Circuit precedent required
only that Elonis "intentionally made the communication, not that he
intended to make a threat." At trial, Elonis testified that his posts
emulated the rap lyrics of the well-known performer Eminem, some of
which involve fantasies about killing his ex-wife. In Elonis's view, he
had posted "nothing \... that hasn't been said already." The Government
presented as witnesses Elonis's wife and co-workers, all of whom said
they felt afraid and viewed Elonis's posts as serious threats.

 

Elonis requested a jury instruction that "the government must prove that
he intended to communicate a true threat." The District Court denied
that request. The jury instructions instead informed the jury that

"A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a
statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a reasonable
person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to
whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an
intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual." 

The Government's closing argument emphasized that it was irrelevant
whether Elonis intended the postings to be threats---"it doesn't matter
what he thinks." A jury convicted Elonis on four of the five counts
against him, acquitting only on the charge of threatening park patrons
and employees. Elonis was sentenced to three years, eight months'
imprisonment and three years' supervised release.

 

Elonis renewed his challenge to the jury instructions in the Court of
Appeals, contending that the jury should have been required to find that
he intended his posts to be threats. The Court of Appeals disagreed,
holding that the intent required by [Section
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) is
only the intent to communicate words that the defendant understands, and
that a reasonable person would view as a threat. \*\*\*

 

**\*2008** We granted certiorari.

II

 

A

An individual who "transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any
communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat
to injure the person of another" is guilty of a felony and faces up to
five years' imprisonment. [18 U.S.C. §
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) This
statute requires that a communication be transmitted and that the
communication contain a threat. It does not specify that the defendant
must have any mental state with respect to these elements. In
particular, it does not indicate whether the defendant must intend that
his communication contain a threat.\* \* \* 

B

The fact that the statute does not specify any required mental state,
however, does not mean that none exists. We have repeatedly held that
"mere omission from a criminal enactment of any mention of criminal
intent" should not be read "as dispensing with it." \* \* \* This rule
of construction reflects the basic principle that "wrongdoing must be
conscious to be criminal." *.* \* \* \*The "central thought" is that a
defendant must be "blameworthy in mind" before he can be found guilty, a
concept courts have expressed over time through various terms such
as *mens rea,* scienter, malice aforethought, guilty knowledge, and the
like. \*\*\*We therefore generally "interpret \[ \] criminal statutes to
include broadly applicable scienter requirements, even where the statute
by its terms does not contain them." \* \* \* 

 

This is not to say that a defendant must know that his conduct is
illegal before he may be found guilty. The familiar maxim "ignorance of
the law is no excuse" typically holds true. Instead, our cases have
explained that a defendant generally must "know the facts that make his
conduct fit the definition of the offense," \* \* \* even if he does not
know that those facts give rise to a crime.

 

*\* \* \**

 

When interpreting federal criminal statutes that are silent on the
required mental state, we read into the statute "only that *mens
rea* which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from 'otherwise
innocent conduct.' " \* \* \*  In some cases, a general requirement that
a defendant *act* knowingly is itself an adequate safeguard. \* \* \*

**\*2011** C

**^\[5\]^** [Section
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5),
as noted, requires proof that a communication was transmitted and that
it contained a threat. \* \* \* The parties agree that a defendant
under [Section
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) must
know that he is transmitting a communication. But
communicating *something *is not what makes the conduct "wrongful." Here
"the crucial element separating legal innocence from wrongful conduct"
is the threatening nature of the communication. The mental state
requirement must therefore apply to the fact that the communication
contains a threat.

 

Elonis's conviction, however, was premised solely on how his posts would
be understood by a reasonable person. Such a "reasonable person"
standard is a familiar feature of civil liability in tort law, but is
inconsistent with "the conventional requirement for criminal
conduct---*awareness* of some wrongdoing." \* \* \*. Having liability
turn on whether a "reasonable person" regards the communication as a
threat---regardless of what the defendant thinks---"reduces culpability
on the all-important element of the crime to negligence \* \* \* and we
"have long been reluctant to infer that a negligence standard was
intended in criminal statutes," \* \* \* Under these principles, "what
\[Elonis\] thinks" does matter. 

 

The Government is at pains to characterize its position as something
other than a negligence standard, emphasizing that its approach would
require proof that a defendant "comprehended \[the\] contents and
context" of the communication. \* \* \* The Government gives two
examples of individuals who, in its view, would lack this necessary
mental state---a "foreigner, ignorant of the English language," who
would not know the meaning of the words at issue, or an individual
mailing a sealed envelope without knowing its contents.*. *But the fact
that the Government would require a defendant to actually know the words
of and circumstances surrounding a communication does not amount to a
rejection of negligence. Criminal negligence standards often incorporate
"the circumstances known" to a defendant. \* \* \* Courts then ask,
however, whether a reasonable person equipped with that knowledge, not
the actual defendant, would have recognized the harmfulness of his
conduct. That is precisely the Government's position here: Elonis can be
convicted, the Government contends, if he himself knew the contents and
context of his posts, and a reasonable person would have recognized that
the posts would be read as genuine threats. That is a negligence
standard.

 

In support of its position the Government relies most heavily
on [*Hamling v. United States,* 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d
590
(1974)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1974127244&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)).
In that case, the Court rejected the argument that individuals could be
convicted of mailing obscene material only if they knew the "legal
status of the materials" distributed. \* \* \* Absolving a defendant of
liability because he lacked the knowledge that the materials were
legally obscene "would permit the defendant to avoid prosecution by
simply claiming that he had not brushed up on the law." \* \* \*  It was
instead enough for liability that "a defendant had knowledge of the
contents of the materials he distributed, and that he knew the character
and nature of the materials." *Ibid*.

 

This holding does not help the Government. In fact, the Court
in *Hamling* approved a state court's conclusion that requiring a
defendant to know the character of the material incorporated a "vital
element of scienter" so that "not innocent but *calculated
purveyance *of filth \... is exorcised." * *\* \* \* In this case,
"calculated purveyance" of a threat would require that Elonis know the
threatening nature of his communication. Put simply, the mental state
requirement the Court approved in *Hamling* turns on whether a defendant
knew the *character *of what was sent, not simply its contents and
context.

 

 

 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see *post,* at 2019 -- 2020, 2022
-- 2023 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), nothing in [*Rosen v. United
States,* 161 U.S. 29, 16 S.Ct. 434, 40 L.Ed. 606
(1896)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1896180060&pubNum=0000708&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)),
undermines this reading. The defendant's contention in *Rosen* was that
his indictment for mailing obscene material was invalid because it did
not allege that he was aware of the contents of the mailing. \* \*
\*  That is not at issue here; there is no dispute that Elonis knew the
words he communicated. The defendant also argued that he could not be
convicted of mailing obscene material if he did not know that the
material "could be properly or justly characterized as obscene." \* \*
\* The Court correctly rejected this "ignorance of the law" defense; no
such contention is at issue here. 

 

\* \* \*

 

In light of the foregoing, Elonis's conviction cannot stand. The jury
was instructed that the Government need prove only that a reasonable
person would regard Elonis's communications as threats, and that was
error. Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the
results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state. That
understanding "took deep and early root in American soil" and Congress
left it intact here: Under [Section
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5),
"wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal." 

 

There is no dispute that the mental state requirement in [Section
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) is
satisfied if the defendant transmits a communication for the purpose of
issuing a threat, or with knowledge that the communication will be
viewed as a threat. \* \* \*

  

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

dissenting.

 

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the lower courts over the
appropriate mental state for threat prosecutions under [18 U.S.C. §
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5).
Save two, every Circuit to have considered the issue---11 in total---has
held that this provision demands proof only of general intent, which
here requires no more than that a defendant knew he transmitted a
communication, knew the words used in that communication, and understood
the ordinary meaning of those words in the relevant context. The
outliers are the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which have concluded that
proof of an intent to threaten was necessary for conviction. Adopting
the minority position, Elonis urges us to hold that [§
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) and
the First Amendment require proof of an intent to threaten. The
Government in turn advocates a general-intent approach.

 

Rather than resolve the conflict, the Court casts aside the approach
used in nine Circuits and leaves nothing in its place. Lower courts are
thus left to guess at the appropriate mental state for [§
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5).
All they know after today's decision is that a requirement of general
intent will not do. But they can safely infer that a majority of this
Court would not adopt an intent-to-threaten requirement, as the opinion
carefully leaves open the possibility that recklessness may be enough.

 

\* \* \*

 

The only dispute in this case is about the state of mind necessary to
convict Elonis for making those posts. On its face, [§
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) does
not demand any particular mental state. As the Court correctly explains,
the word "threat" does not itself contain a *mens rea* requirement.
See *ante,* at 2008 -- 2009. But because we read criminal statutes "in
light of the background rules of the common law, in which the
requirement of some *mens rea* for a crime is firmly embedded," we
require "some indication of congressional intent, express or implied,
\... to dispense with *mens rea* as an element of a crime." \* \*
\* Absent such indicia, we ordinarily apply the "presumption in favor of
scienter" to require only "proof of *general intent*---that is, that the
defendant \[must\] posses\[s\] knowledge with respect to the *actus
reus* of the crime." \* \* \*

 

Under this "conventional *mens rea* element," "the defendant \[must\]
know the facts that make his conduct illegal," but he need not
know *that* those facts make his conduct illegal. 

 

\* \* \*

Applying ordinary rules of statutory construction, I would read [§
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) to
require proof of general intent. To "know the facts that make his
conduct illegal" under [§
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5),
a defendant must know that he transmitted a communication in interstate
or foreign commerce that contained a threat. Knowing that the
communication contains a "threat"---a serious expression of an intention
to engage in unlawful physical violence---does not, however, require
knowing that a jury will conclude that the communication contains a
threat as a matter of law. Instead, like one who mails an "obscene"
publication and is prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute, a
defendant prosecuted under [§
875(c)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS875&originatingDoc=Ib7ff63c4083311e590d4edf60ce7d742&refType=RB&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Search)#co_pp_4b24000003ba5) must
know only the words used in that communication, along with their
ordinary meaning in context.

Notes and Questions - Elonis v. United States

 

1.  Inchoate crimes and the internet. Consider this  section from  [18
    U.S.C. §
    2261A(2)(A)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS2261A&__lrTS=20200727224022856&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29):

"Whoever with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or place under
surveillance with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate, or
cause substantial emotional distress to a person in another State \* \*
\* uses the mail, any interactive computer service, or any facility of
interstate \* \* \* commerce to engage in a course of conduct that
causes substantial emotional distress to that person \* \* \* shall be
punished \* \* \*"

Now consider the following fact pattern:

Otis was accused of harassment and intimidating conduct after sending
defamatory, profanity-laden  texts and emails to his former girlfriend.
He even went so far as to post some of these sentiments on Facebook and
Twitter for others to see. 

Should this conduct be criminally prosecuted? Where is the line between
protecting individuals from internet harassment and protecting First
Amendment rights?

2.  Now, take this inquiry a step further. Consider the role that intent
    plays in the prosecution of inchoate crimes and then read the
    following passage from Kimberly Kessler Ferzan, [Inchoate Crimes at
    the Prevention/ Punishment
    Divide,](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I83b8e181486a11e18b05fdf15589d8e8/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad73aa70000017392c522ec2b852a17%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DI83b8e181486a11e18b05fdf15589d8e8%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=4a60b9fd108b61f0a5781f89523ad652&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=1&sessionScopeId=2d6edfb6a964581b1a970563aafefb6c89e262c35247851c1e9167203bf41401&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29)
    48 San Diego L. Rev. 1273 (2011):

"The possession of burglar\'s tools is an example of a preparatory
offense. Possession of burglar\'s tools is a crime, and yet at the time
Alex possesses the tools, he has not formed the intention to use the
tools illegally. Moreover, there is nothing harmful in the possession of
these tools. The justifications for the law are that it allows early
police intervention and eases prosecutorial burdens, not that it tracks
retributive desert. The state creates new completed offenses, ultimately
ignoring that they are mere preparatory steps towards the commission of
the crime the state wishes to prevent. As Michael Moore notes,

The problem with . . . "wrongs by proxy" is that \[they\] give liberty a
strong kick in the teeth right at the start. Such an argument does not
even pretend that there is any culpability or wrongdoing for which it
would urge punishment; rather, punishment of a non-wrongful,
non-culpable action is used for purely preventive ends.

Paul Robinson has cautioned that the use of the criminal law for
regulatory purposes undermines its moral strength. Moreover, because
these offenses may include nonculpable conduct, they risk creating a
chilling effect and deterring law-abiding citizens from engaging in
permissible activities."

1200238CR; A157030

**\[ ... \]**

TOOKEY, J.

Defendant appeals a judgment convicting him of nine crimes, contending
that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of
acquittal and entering convictions on four counts of attempted
aggravated murder (Counts 1 through 4), three counts of attempted murder
(Counts 5 through 7), and two counts of tampering with a witness (Counts
15 and 16).[^104] Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying
his motion for judgment of acquittal on those counts, because defendant
did not take a substantial step toward the commission of each of those
crimes, and thus cannot be guilty of attempt. For the reasons that
follow, we affirm.

**\[ ... \]**

Defendant was incarcerated pending prosecution on a burglary charge.
Defendant became cellmates with another inmate, Crowley. Defendant told
Crowley that defendant "wanted his witnesses \[to his burglary case\] to
not show up to trial," and that "he wanted people dead." Specifically,
defendant mentioned his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the Wasco
County District Attorney. Defendant asked Crowley whether Crowley knew
of anyone who had killed a person before. Crowley responded, "Yeah, I
have. I mean, I've been to prison. I mean, I know people that have
killed people." Defendant asked whether Crowley "could have somebody
killed" and Crowley responded affirmatively. In fact, Crowley did not
know of such a person. After hearing that Crowley "might know somebody
that could do something," defendant began "writing stuff," including
writing people's names. Within hours, Crowley sent several inmate
request forms to jail staff, asking to speak to detectives because
"someone could get hurt." Sergeant Birchfield visited Crowley, and
Crowley told Birchfield what defendant had said.

When Crowley returned to his cell, defendant was writing a letter.
According to Crowley, defendant "wrote out a couple letters, and he
wanted to get it perfect. His detail about it had to be perfect." When
defendant finished writing the letter, he gave it to Crowley to read,
then put the letter in an envelope, placed it underneath his mattress,
and asked Crowley if he was a cop. The next morning, defendant gave
Crowley the envelope. Defendant believed that Crowley would "put \[the
envelope in Crowley's personal\] property" and release it to someone
outside the prison "so that a hit man could get it for \[defendant\] and
take care of what he wanted \[taken\] care of."[^105] The envelope
contained a map of defendant's father-in-law's house and a letter
stating:

> "Dear stranger,
>
> "I have a job for you. I need your help. There are three people I need
> taken care of. First one is my father-in-law. \* \* \* Second is my

(Underscoring in original.) After giving Crowley the envelope with the
letter, defendant repeatedly asked Crowley, "Are they coming yet? Are
they coming yet? Is he going to do it yet? Why ain't this done yet?"

Shortly thereafter, defendant and Crowley were placed in separate
isolation cells across the hall from one another. Defendant and Crowley
exchanged handwritten notes by using strings to fling cylinder-shaped
papers into one another's cells.**\[ ... \]**

Crowley saved the notes that he received from defendant and gave them to
jail staff.

Defendant was charged with four counts of attempted aggravated murder,
three counts of attempted murder, four counts of solicitation of
aggravated murder, three counts of solicitation of murder, and two
counts of tampering with a witness. Defendant tried his case to the
court. After the state rested, defendant moved for a judgment of
acquittal as to the four counts of attempted aggravated murder, three
counts of attempted murder, and two counts of tampering with a witness.
Defendant argued that the state failed to present sufficient evidence
that defendant engaged in conduct constituting a substantial step
towards the commission of the charged crimes, as required by ORS
161.405. The trial court denied defendant's motion for judgment of
acquittal and found defendant guilty of the attempted aggravated murder,
attempted murder, and tampering with a witness counts. As to the
solicitation counts, the trial court found defendant guilty of attempted
solicitation.

On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by denying his
motion for judgment of acquittal on the counts of attempted aggravated
murder, attempted murder, and tampering with a witness. Defendant renews
his argument that he did not take a substantial step toward the
commission of the crimes of aggravated murder, murder, and tampering
with a witness. According to defendant, he "did not meet with a
purported 'hit man,' he did not engage in detailed planning, and he did
not pay money or arrange to pay money," and therefore his conduct was
insufficient to satisfy the substantial step element of his attempt
convictions and his convictions for tampering with a witness.[^106]
Defendant contends that " \[h\] is desire to meet with someone to make a
plan is not a plan in itself, much less a substantial step toward the
commission of the objective." In response, the state argues that
defendant's conduct was "more than enough to amount to a substantial
step."

**\[ ... \]**We begin with the text of ORS 161.405(1), which provides
that "\[a\] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when the
person intentionally engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial
step toward commission of the crime." In *State v. Walters,* 311 Or 80,
85, 804 P2d 1164, *cert den,* 501 US 1209 (1991), the Supreme Court
observed that "ORS 161.405 codifies the Model Penal Code's 'substantial
step' test for distinguishing acts of preparation from an attempt."
(Footnote omitted.)

To constitute a substantial step, a "defendant's conduct must (1)
advance the criminal purpose charged and (2) provide some verification
of the existence of that purpose." *Id.* "Under that standard, an
attempt \*\*\* must be established by conduct that is corroborative of
the actor's criminal purpose." *State v. Carlton,* 361 Or 29, 45, 388
P3d 1093 (2017). "\[T\]he same conduct may constitute a substantial step
toward the commission of more than one charged crime, as long as that
conduct strongly corroborates the actor's criminal purpose underlying
each charged crime." *Walters,* 311 Or at 86 n 9. There is no special
rule regarding whether a solicitation is also an attempt: "\[U\]nder
Oregon law, '\[s\]olicitation \*\*\* qualifies as a "substantial step"
if, under the facts, the defendant's actions exceed mere preparation,
advance the criminal purpose charged, and provide some verification of
the existence of that purpose.'" **\[ ... \]**

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we
conclude that a reasonable factfinder could determine that defendant's
conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the
murders of his father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the Wasco County
District Attorney. As recounted above, defendant told Crowley that he
"wanted people dead," specifically mentioning his father-in-law,
brother-in-law, and the Wasco County District Attorney. Defendant then
asked Crowley whether Crowley "could have somebody killed." When Crowley
answered in the affirmative, defendant carefully composed a letter to an
unknown "hit man" that set out the details of his intended murders.
Then, defendant gave the letter to Crowley for the purpose of delivering
it to the purported hit man. Finally, defendant inquired of Crowley why
the murders were not "done yet." As the trial court explained,

> "With regard to advancing the purpose, it's very clear from the
> content of the letter that the Defendant gave great consideration to
> the details of the offenses. And had he just sat around and thought
> about that, \* \* \* we'd have no offense here. But he did the next
> step of writing it all down. And then he went beyond that, delivering
> it to a third person with the intent that it be carried out, believing
> that that third person had a relationship with individuals that could
> carry it out. And he actively inquired about the progress of the
> events related to his letter."

Defendant's contention that his "desire to meet with someone to make a
plan is not a plan in itself," mischar-acterizes the evidence. Indeed,
viewed in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence shows that
defendant advanced his criminal purpose by seeking out a hit man, and
writing and delivering the letter to Crowley, with the intention that
Crowley deliver the letter to the hit man; as a result, defendant
believed that the letter alone would result in the murders of his
father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the district attorney. As the trial
court noted, defendant's letter provided detail with regards to whom he
wanted killed, how be wanted them killed, and how the hit man would be
compensated, and after delivering the letter to Crowley, defendant
repeatedly asked why the murders had not taken place. To explain why the
murders were not committed promptly, Crowley later told defendant that
the hit man would visit defendant to finalize the details of the
murders. Before that point, however, a trier of fact could find that
defendant believed that the letter alone would cause the hit man to
commit the murders; indeed, defendant's actions exceeded mere
preparation because defendant had done all that he could have done under
the circumstances to cause the murders of his intended victims. *See
State v. Taylor,* 47 Or 455, 459, 84 P 82 (1906) (holding that the
defendant's actions exceeded mere preparation for purposes of attempt
where "he had \* \* \* done all that he was expected to do, and his
felonious design and action was then just as complete as if the crime
had been consummated" and that "failure to commit the crime was not due
to any act of \[the defendant\], but to the insufficiency of the
agencies employed for carrying out his criminal design"). Thus,
defendant's actions advanced his criminal purpose in having his
father-in-law, brother-in-law, and the district attorney murdered.
Moreover, a reasonable factfinder could also conclude that that same
evidence of defendant's conduct verified his criminal purpose. In that
way, defendant's conduct was corroborative of his criminal purpose.

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, because a reasonable factfinder could conclude that
defendant's conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission
of aggravated murder, murder, and tampering with a witness, the trial
court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of
acquittal.

Affirmed.

SERCOMBE, P. J.,

concurring.

ORS 161.405(1) provides that "\[a\] person is guilty of an attempt to
commit a crime when the person intentionally engages in conduct which
constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime." To
constitute a "substantial step" toward the commission of a crime, "ah
act must be strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose; that
is, the actor's conduct must (1) advance the criminal purpose charged;
and (2) provide verification of the existence of that purpose." *State
v. Carlton,* 361 Or 29, 45, 388 P3d 1093 (2017). I agree with the
majority that, under our case law, defendant's actions in instructing a
hypothetical hit man on the details of the crimes and the amount of
compensation to be paid for commission of the crimes and delivering
those instructions to a courier were a substantial step toward the
commission of those crimes. *See State v. Johnson,* 202 Or App 478,
487-89, 123 P3d 304 (2005), *rev den,* 340 Or 158 (2006) (solicitation
of crime as a substantial step); *State v. Taylor,* 47 Or 455, 459, 84 P
82 (1906) (mere preparation exceeded .when defendant had "done all that
he was expected to do").

I question whether this decision and our case law have pushed the
substantial step line too far into the territory of conduct that is
merely preparatory in nature. Even if actual solicitation of a crime can
be a substantial step, how is an *attempted* solicitation equally
substantial? It seems to me that conduct that advances a criminal
purpose is conduct that makes the crimes more likely to occur.
Defendant's delivery of the letter to his cellmate did not make the
crimes any more likely, even though the delivery corroborates
defendant's intent to commit the crimes.

The test that a defendant has "done all that he was expected to do" in
determining whether a substantial step has been taken, while suggested
by our precedents, should be re-examined and discarded, and the meaning
of "advancing the criminal purpose charged" should be clarified.

MARTIN, Justice.

**\[ ... \]**

[\[1\]](#X39a5a56fdb3c5c50dbff3a1e1ba5ea6980980a3) It is well
established that solicitation of another to commit a felony is a crime
in North Carolina. **\[ ... \]**This is true even though the
solicitation is of no effect and the crime solicited is never committed.
*Id.* **\[ ... \]**

Solicitation involves the asking, enticing, inducing, or counselling of
another to commit a crime. *State v. Furr,* 292 N.C. 711, 235 S.E. 2d
193. The solicitor conceives the criminal idea and furthers its
commission via another person by suggesting to, inducing, or
manipulating that person. As noted by Wechsler, Jones, and Korn in *The
Treatment of Inchoate Crimes in the Model Penal Code of the American Law
Institute: Attempt, Solicitation and Conspiracy,* 61 Colum. L. Rev. 571,
621-22 (1961), "the solicitor, working his will through one or more
agents, manifests an approach to crime more intelligent and masterful
than the efforts of his hireling," and a solicitation, "an attempt to
conspire," may well be more dangerous than an attempt. Indeed, a
solicitor may be more dangerous than a conspirator; a conspirator may
merely passively agree to a criminal scheme, while the solicitor plans,
schemes, suggests, encourages, and incites the solicitation. Further,
the solicitor is morally more culpable than a conspirator; he keeps
himself from being at risk, hiding behind the actor, as occurred in this
case.

Decided 26 Oct. 1989.

**\[ ... \]**

BLOMMERS, Judge:

**\[ ... \]** Before a general court-martial with members, the
appellant, contrary to his pleas, was found guilty of the attempted
premeditated murder of his wife in violation of Article 80, UCMJ, 10
U.S.C. 880.[^\[1\]^](#Xd40cf344170f7d5b5fa7edb4f5a96b8e3e63bf6) His
sentence, as adjudged and approved, extends to a dishonorable discharge,
confinement for ten years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances; and
reduction to airman basic (E-1). **\[ ... \]**

Simply stated, it is asserted that the evidence is not sufficient to
support findings of guilty of attempted murder. We disagree and affirm.
**\[ ... \]**

## **\[ ... \]**

The appellant and his wife were married in 1985, and a son was born of
this union about a year later. In 1987, they experienced marital
difficulties which eventually led to their separation. **\[ ... \]**the
local district court awarded custody of the child to the appellant's
wife, and shortly thereafter she returned with the child to her home in
Michigan. The appellant loved his son and desired to regain custody of
him, but began to realize it was unlikely he would be able to do so
through the courts.

**\[ ... \]**

On about 31 March 1988, Airman Meyer**\[ ... \]**was talking with the
appellant in the hallway of their dormitory. The appellant said that
since. Meyer was from a big city, he wondered if Meyer knew anybody who
could do a job for him. Knowing the appellant's family situation, Meyer
believed the appellant was talking about getting someone to kill his
wife so he could regain custody of his son. Meyer replied that he would
check around and make some calls, but really did not take the appellant
seriously. A couple of days later, he made one call to a friend back in
New York in the appellant's presence. He asked his friend, "Do you know
anybody that you could find to eliminate this guy's wife so he can get
custody of his kid?" The appellant gave no indication he had just been
kidding around or joking when Meyer asked this question. On another
occasion when Meyer was present, the appellant made a rough drawing of
the residence where his wife was living and explained how easily someone
could gain access to it. On about 6 April, Meyer went with the appellant
to the city of Grand Forks to pick up tax returns. During the trip, the
appellant said he was expecting an \$800.00 refund and implied it could
be used to pay for his wife's killing.

On 7 April 1988, Sergeant Skyberg, a co-worker and friend, received a
message that the appellant wanted to talk to him. **\[ ... \]** After
Skyberg arrived, the appellant asked him if he knew anyone "who could .
. . \[the appellant gestured with his hand, his fingers arranged as if
to simulate a gun\] his wife." The appellant indicated that he felt that
was the only way he could get custody of his son. He said he was getting
out of the service in about a month, and wanted "it" done before he left
so he would have a good alibi as to where he was at the time. Skyberg
believed the appellant was serious. **\[ ... \]** Skyberg and Meyer
discussed the matter further and decided to contact the Office of
Special Investigations (OSI).

**\[ ... \]**OSI decided to open up an investigation and attempt to
place an undercover agent in the role of a hit man. **\[ ... \]** Meyer
was instructed to contact the appellant and tell him that his
\[Meyer's\] friend in New York had found someone to do the job if the
appellant was still interested. The appellant indicated he was, and
Meyer told him an individual by the name of "Nick" (in reality, Special
Agent Nicholas J. Karnezis) would call him on the evening of 19 April.
The appellant subsequently borrowed \$400.00 from Meyer (money provided
by OSI) to help pay the hit man.

Nick called the appellant as planned, and indicated**\[ ... \]**that he
would need a picture of the appellant's wife, a sketch of the house, and
maps of the local area in Michigan. The appellant said he already had
the picture and a detailed diagram of the residence, and that he could
get the maps. Nick indicated he would need \$500.00 up front for
expenses. It Was agreed they would meet at the Holiday Inn in Fargo,
North Dakota on 22 April 1988 and that the appellant would wear an Ohio
State football jacket and carry a *Time* magazine so Nick could
recognize him.

The meeting occurred as planned. After some discussion about his family
situation the appellant indicated he wanted his Wife killed. The
appellant said he had brought the things Nick had asked for and had
\$1,100.00 with him, \$500.00 for the job, plus \$600.00 for air fare.
After discussing the location of the appellant's residence, Nick
simulated a phone call to an airline ticket agent, booking a flight to
Marquette, Michigan. The appellant provided Nick„With pictures of his
Wife and son; a spiral notebook containing a list of people who lived in
the house and hours they were away from home, two detailed diagrams of
the house and surrounding area, and directions on how to get to the
house from the Marquette airport; a Rand-McNally road atlas with two
different routes from the airport to the house highlighted; and, a local
Marquette area phone book, which included the phone number at his Wife's
home. They discussed the schedules of the residents, the vehicles they
drove, Where the dogs were located, closets in the house where guns were
kept, and other details of the planned murder. They settled on a total
price of \$2,100.00 if the job went as easily as the appellant indicated
it should. The appellant gave Nick the \$1,100.00 he had brought with
him. Nick asked for ideas on how the killing should be done, and the
appellant said it seemed to him the easiest way was to make it look like
a robbery and that his wife got in the way. As to the weapon, he
indicated a knife or gun could be used. Nick showed the appellant a .22
caliber semi-automatic pistol, equipped with a silencer, that he had in
his brief case. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

On the morning of 26 April, the appellant was notified of his wife's
death by his unit commander. According to Airman Meyer, the appellant
told him that everyone was sympathetic and that the appellant put on "a
Class A act," including crying and laying down on the first sergeant's
couch. Later that day, the appellant received a message to meet Nick
down in Fargo. He proceeded to the Holiday Inn in Fargo. He told Nick he
had received notification of his wife's death. Nick said: "You mean you
got the word already!" And the appellant replied: "You do good work."
Nick showed the appellant a picture of his wife laying on the floor with
what appeared to be two bullet wounds, one in her head and another in
her neck. The appellant confirmed that it was his Wife. After some
further discussion, he gave Nick \$1,000.00. At that point Nick
identified himself as a government agent and apprehended the
appellant.**\[ ... \]**

## An Attempt or Only a Solicitation?

\[2\] On the appellant's behalf, it is forcefully argued that his
conduct never passed the threshold from mere preparation (i.e., a
solicitation) to an attempt to commit the offense because there was no
"dangerous proximity" to success of the planned murder. See *Hyde v.
United States*, 225 U.S. 347, 388, 32 S.Ct. 793, 810, 56 L.Ed. 1114,
1134 (1911) (Justice Holmes dissenting); Perkins, Criminal Law 572 (2d
Ed.1969). Since there is little military authority on point, appellate
counsel rely principally on state court approaches to this
dilemma.[^\[4\]^](#Xf9f97505d49a46fbc2a71f40efb4d5aef406787) See, e.g.,
*State v. Otto*, 102 Idaho 250, 629 P.2d 646 (1981); *Hobbs v. State*,
548 S.W.2d 884 (Tex.Ct.App.1977); **\[ ... \]**. In various factual
situations involving "contracting out" for crimes, these courts held
that the evidence only established mere acts of preparation not leading
directly or proximately to consummation of the intended
crime.[^\[5\]^](#X41534586b96d5fe1680809ff9b4b3828f674df9) For example,
in Adami the Court concluded that "the contemplated murder would not
have resulted in the usual course of natural events since neither the
'agent' nor the solicitor \[defendant\] did any unequivocal overt act
which can be said to be a commencement of the commission of the intended
crime." *People v. Adami*, 111 Ca1.Rptr. at 548.

Typical, and perhaps closest factually to the present appellant's case,
are the companion cases of Davis and Lourie. They involved a plan
hatched by two lovers to murder the woman's husband (Edmon Lourie) so
that they could get his life insurance amounting to \$66,000.00. The
parties resided in Kansas City, Missouri. In furtherance of their plan,
Davis engaged a man named Leverton to find an ex­convict who would commit
the murder for hire. However, Leverton disclosed the plot to the police.
Thereafter, several meetings were held between Davis, Leverton and an
undercover police officer, Dill. It was agreed that Dill would kill Mr.
Lourie for \$600.00 and diamonds valued at about \$3,000.00 owned by the
Lourie's. Also, arrangements were made for Dill to meet Mrs. Lourie so
they would be able to recognize each other. It was decided that the
contemplated assault would occur in Chicago, where Mr. Lourie had gone
on business. Davis provided Dill a map showing where Mr. Lourie could be
located and two photos of him. If Dill could not locate him, Mrs. Lourie
would also travel to Chicago to assist. However, this part of the plan
was interrupted when Mr. Lourie returned early from his trip. It was
then decided that Mrs. Lourie would persuade her husband to go out for a
night on the town, and that they would leave their home at 8:00 p.m. on
a certain date. Mrs. Lourie was to have the diamonds on her person so it
would appear that robbery was the motive for the crime. She would be
"mussed up", and then faint, permitting Dill time to escape\~ On the
evening in question, Dill, accompanied by three other police officers,
proceeded to the Lourie residence as planned. The Lourie's were dressed
and ready to leave; Mrs. Lourie had the diamonds on her person. Davis,
also as planned, was at home in another part of the city in order to
have an alibi. Two of the officers entered the residence and took charge
of the Lourie S, while Dill and the other officer proceeded to Davis'
residence and arrested him. The Supreme Court of Missouri concluded:

> The employment of Dill as agent to murder Lourie was not tantamount to
> an attempt. Dill not only had no intention of carrying out the
> expressed purpose of defendant, but was guilty of no act directly or
> indirectly moving toward the consummation of the intended crime. He
> did nothing more than listen to the plans and solicitations of
> defendant without intending to act upon them. It was not shown that
> Dill committed an act that could be construed as an attempt. The
> arrest of Lourie, his wife, and defendant as detailed in the evidence
> could not be said to be an act involving the consummation of the
> crime. (Citations omitted.)

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

We are not convinced, however, that **\[ ... \]** a factual situation
such as that present in the Davis and Laurie cases will not constitute
an attempt to commit a crime. In this regard, we find solace in the
reasoning of some of the dissenters in the foregoing cases. In Davis,
Chief Justice Walker wrote: "Without limitation it may be said that the
defendant did everything within the contemplation of malicious human
ingenuity to enable the putative murderer to commit the crime, short of
actual participation therein." **\[ ... \]**

> \[**\[ ... \]**

In *United States v. Byrd*, 24 M.J. 286, 290 (C.M.A. 1987), the United
States Court of Military Appeals relied upon a test adopted by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:

> \[T\]o be guilty of an attempt, a 'defendant must have engaged in
> conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the
> crime' and that substantial step must be conduct strongly
> corroborative of the firmness of the defendant's criminal intent.
> *United States v. Jackson*, 560 F.2d 112, 116 (2d Cir.), c**\[ ...
> \]**

The appellant's conduct in obtaining the services of Nicholas Karnezis
to murder his wife, his detailed participation in planning the intended
crime, up to advising the agent exactly how he wanted his wife shot, and
his payment of the agreed upon consideration, both before the crime was
to occur and after he was apprised that it had, constitutes "a
substantial step toward commission of the crime," and establishes the
requisite overt act amounting to more than mere preparation. We can
envision nothing else the appellant could possibly have done to effect
what he believed would be his wife\'s murder, short of committing the
act himself (which is precisely what he did not want to do). As
characterized by appellate government counsel during oral argument, the
appellant armed a missile (Nick) and fired it off, fully believing it
was aimed directly at his intended victim. **\[ ... \]** Or, using an
example contained in the Manual: "if A, without justification or excuse
and with intent to kill B, points a gun at B and pulls the trigger, A is
guilty of attempt to murder, even though, unknown to A, the gun is
defective and will not fire." MCM, Part IV, para. 4c(3) (1984). If we
were to accept the reasoning of appellate defense counsel neither
appellant nor SA Karnezis ever took any steps or perpetration in
dangerous proximity to the commission of the offense planned" because
the agent never intended to commit the offense»-no contract for hire
criminal scheme could ever be prosecuted as an attempt if the person
hired turned out to be a government agent or informant. **\[ ... \]** To
place our criminal justice system in this posture defies logic. It is
the accused's criminal intent we are concerned with, not that of the
person hired to commit the crime. **\[ ... \]**

Turning to that intent, we find the record replete with evidence
establishing "conduct strongly corroborative of the firmness of the
defendant's criminal intent." The appellant retained whom he believed to
be a big city hit man for the purpose of murdering his wife; he paid an
agreed upon amount of money up front; he provided photographs, documents
and diagrams to facilitate commission of the crime; he helped plan
precisely how it would be committed; he indicated the need for an alibi
for himself; after being advised that his wife had moved, he agreed to
an increase in the contract price and obtained her new telephone number;
when notified of her murder through unit channels, he "put on a Class A
act;" upon being shown a staged picture of his wife with gun shot
wounds, he commended Nick for his "good work," and paid a further
installment on the contract price. The firmness of his intent is clearly
established.[^\[8\]^](#Xb633319b17bc885e34aa536e6373f3717f7da86)

We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty
of attempted murder. We further find the sentence to be appropriate for
commission of this crime. **\[ ... \]**

[\[1\]](#X57babf98905b1afbe37115b024367c6577b594d) He was also charged
with attempted conspiracy to commit premeditated murder, but the
military judge granted a defense motion to dismiss that offense as being
multiplicious with the offense of attempted premeditated murder. We also
note that there can be no conspiracy when a supposed participant merely
feigns acquiescence in the criminal venture to secure another\'s
detection and apprehension by proper authorities*. United States v.
LaBossiere*, 13 MA. 337, 32 C.M.R. 337 (1962).

[\[2\]](#Xf491ed040875e17a6229851ae87e1570857e823) Other parts of
paragraph 4c, Part IV of the Manual provide the following guidance:

> \(2\) More than preparation. Preparation consists of devising or
> arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the
> offense. The overt act required goes beyond preparatory steps and is a
> direct movement toward the commission of the offense. For example, a
> purchase of matches with the intent to burn a haystack is not an
> attempt to commit arson, but it is an attempt to commit arson lo
> applying \[sic\] a burning match to a haystack, even if no fire
> results. The overt act need not be the last act essential to the

The Analysis to the 1984 Manual indicates that these provisions are
based on paragraph 159 of the 1969 Manual. MCM, App. 21, para. 4 at
(1984). Paragraph 159 provided in part:

> An accused may be guilty of an attempt even though the commission of

> circumstances or even though the consummation of the intended offense
> was prevented by a mistake on the part of the accused. The physical

another to commit murder is 5 years. At trial, the parties agreed that
solicitation to commit murder was a lesser included offense to the

1.  According to Ira P. Robbins, [Double Inchoate
    Crimes](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib6bb3b6149df11db99a18fc28eb0d9ae/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad73aa700000173930b996b5754a778%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIb6bb3b6149df11db99a18fc28eb0d9ae%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=a1b7a0f24a613f3b5be045ffb7e24b32&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=1&sessionScopeId=b92f97dacdb1bd27527dfcee1a621f62907ee13e44e027efa9925ed9e21cc3f4&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29),
    26 Harv. J. on Legis. 1 (1989):

"The mens rea of solicitation is a specific intent to have someone
commit a completed crime. As in common-law conspiracy, disclosure of the
criminal scheme to another party constitutes a part of the actus reus of
solicitation. But, while the actus reus of a conspiracy is an agreement
with another to commit a specific completed offense, the actus reus of a
solicitation includes an attempt to persuade another to commit a
specific offense. A necessary element of solicitation is the
solicitant\'s rejection of the solicitor\'s request. Thus, solicitation
can be viewed as an attempt to conspire."

2.  Common law v. MPC approach to solicitation. Ira P. Robbins, [Double
    Inchoate
    Crimes](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ib6bb3b6149df11db99a18fc28eb0d9ae/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad73aa700000173930b996b5754a778%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIb6bb3b6149df11db99a18fc28eb0d9ae%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=a1b7a0f24a613f3b5be045ffb7e24b32&list=ANALYTICAL&rank=1&sessionScopeId=b92f97dacdb1bd27527dfcee1a621f62907ee13e44e027efa9925ed9e21cc3f4&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29),
    26 Harv. J. on Legis. 1 (1989):

"Solicitation developed as a common-law notion, but American
jurisdictions increasingly have defined the offense statutorily. Unlike
the common law, which generally and vaguely described the object crimes
that solicitation covered as those that breached the public peace,
current state statutes define the offense\'s coverage to restrict
judicial discretion. Most states impose penalties for soliciting the
commission of any crime, but some states and the federal government
apply solicitation only to felonies. Others specifically enumerate the
particular object felonies subject to solicitation charges.

** **

The Model Penal Code\'s solicitation provisions broaden the scope of
solicitation statutes to reach more behavior, in three ways. First, the
Code imposes liability for the solicitation of any crime. Second, the
Code incorporates the double inchoate offense of attempt to solicit by
making the solicitor\'s failure to communicate the criminal scheme
immaterial as long as he acted on his intent to effect such
communication. Third, the Code defines the actus reus of solicitation as
acting 'with the purpose of promoting or facilitating' the commission of
a crime. This language incorporates the crime of facilitation into the
solicitation provision. Facilitation, viewed as both a lower level of
complicity and as an inchoate crime, punishes the individual who
knowingly provides assistance to another who intends to commit a crime."

3.  Requisite elements of solicitation. The crime of solicitation, like
    every other crime, involves both an actus reus and a mens rea. The
    actus reus of solicitation is satisfied when an actor hires,
    requests, suggests, or encourages another individual to complete a
    crime. The mens rea of solicitation involves the intent to 1)
    perform the solicitation of another individual and 2) the specific
    intent that the solicited individual will commit the intended
    crime. 

4.  Hypothetical. Jayendra turns to Rolf and tells him, "Wow, I really
    can't stand Nanuq. I should break into his house and steal his
    family heirlooms." Rolf responds, "That sounds like a plan. I'll do
    it." Is Jayendra guilty of solicitation at common law? How about
    under the [MPC
    §5.02](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS5.02&__lrTS=20200728160606947&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29)?

5.  Solicitation and attempt. Can solicitation merge into attempt?
    Consider the following passage from Model Penal Code and
    Commentaries [§
    5.02](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=L&docname=ULPNCOS5.02&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&fn=_top&findtype=L&vr=2.0&db=1002069&wbtoolsId=ULPNCOS5.02&HistoryType=F)
    cmt. 2, at 368--69 (1985):

"Whether the solicitation to commit a crime constitutes an attempt by
the solicitor is a question that has been answered in several ways. One
approach to the problem treats every solicitation as a specific type of
attempt to be governed by ordinary attempt principles, the solicitation
being an overt act that alone or together with other overt acts may
surpass preparation and result in liability. A second position is that a
naked solicitation is not an attempt, but a solicitation accompanied by
other overt acts, for example, the offer of a reward or the furnishing
of materials, does constitute an attempt. The third view is similar to
the second except that in order to find the solicitor guilty of an
attempt the other overt acts must proceed beyond what would be called
preparation if the solicitor planned to commit the crime himself.
Finally, there is the view that no matter what acts the solicitor
commits, he cannot be guilty of an attempt because it is not his purpose
to commit the offense personally. Although there has been considerable
conflict, even among the decisions of the same jurisdiction, the trend
has seemed to be toward the last two solutions \* \* \*."

 

6.  Hypothetical. Apply the previous passage to this hypothetical: Nasim
    left drugs on a table for his friend Aravind to find with a note
    that reads: "There's more of this if you run out. I think your
    friends want some." Is Nasim guilty of solicitation to sell illegal
    substances? Is he guilty of attempted distribution of an illegal
    substance? At what point does a solicitation move into an attempt?

Conspiracy

 

Conspiracy, unlike complicity, is a standalone crime. Its requirements
are very minimal: at common law, only an agreement to commit unlawful
actions. The agreement, itself, is the actus reus. Under federal law, an
act in furtherance is needed to seal the conspiracy. Often, proving
conspiracy is much easier than proving a completed or attempted crime,
and so conspiracy has become a favorite tool of prosecutors to lower the
burden of proof, accumulate charges, or increase the number of people
implicated in a crime. As you read these cases, consider the
distinctions between conspiracy and complicity. Consider also how far
liability extends. What is the mens rea for the crime of conspiracy
itself? What mens rea is necessary for the subsequent crimes committed
in furtherance of the conspiracy? How do the various formulations of
conspiracy liability interact with the justifications of
punishment---retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and
rehabilitation?

Model Penal Code sec. 5.03

 

<https://www.inazu-crimlaw.com/503>

 

**Section 5.03. Criminal Conspiracy**.

\(1\) [Definition of Conspiracy]{.underline}. A person is guilty of
conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the
purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he:

\(a\) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more
of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an
attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; or

\(b\) agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or
commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such
crime.

\(2\) [Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship]{.underline}. If a person
guilty of conspiracy, as defined by Subsection (1) of this Section,
knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has
conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is
guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not
he knows their identity, to commit such crime.

\(3\) [Conspiracy With Multiple Criminal Objectives]{.underline}. If a
person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one
conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same
agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.

\(4\) [Joinder and Venue in Conspiracy Prosecutions]{.underline}.

\(a\) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Subsection, two
or more persons charged with criminal conspiracy may be prosecuted
jointly if:

\(i\) they are charged with conspiring with one another; or

\(ii\) the conspiracies alleged, whether they have the same or different
parties, are so related that they constitute different aspects of a
scheme of organized criminal conduct.

\(b\) In any joint prosecution under paragraph (a) of this Subsection:

\(i\) no defendant shall be charged with a conspiracy in any county
\[parish or district\] other than one in which he entered into such
conspiracy or in which an overt act pursuant to such conspiracy was done
by him or by a person with whom he conspired; and

\(ii\) neither the liability of any defendant nor the admissibility
against him of evidence of acts or declarations of another shall be
enlarged by such joinder; and

\(iii\) the Court shall order a severance or take a special verdict as
to any defendant who so requests, if it deems it necessary or
appropriate to promote the fair determination of his guilt or innocence,
and shall take any other proper measures to protect the fairness of the
trial.

\(5\) [Overt Act]{.underline}. No person may be convicted of conspiracy
to commit a crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree,
unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and
proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.

\(6\) [Renunciation of Criminal Purpose]{.underline}. It is an
affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime,
thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting
a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

\(7\) [Duration of Conspiracy]{.underline}. For purposes of Section
1.06(4):

\(a\) conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the crime or crimes which are its object are committed or the agreement
that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with
whom he conspired; and

\(b\) such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant nor anyone
with whom he conspired does any overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy
during the applicable period of limitation; and

\(c\) if an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is
terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he
conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement
authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation
therein.

People v. Carter

 

Michigan Supreme Court

Docket No. 64583

1982-12-23

**\[ ... \]**

Fitzgerald, C.J., and Williams, Coleman, and Ryan, JJ.

This opinion was written by Justice Blair Moody, Jr., prior to his death
on November 26, 1982. We concur in this opinion and adopt it as our own.

**\[ ... \]**

Criminal conspiracy occupies a unique place in our criminal justice
system. It is defined as \"a partnership in criminal purposes", *United
States v* Kissel, 218 US 601, 608; 31 S Ct 124; 54 L Ed 1168 (1910), a
mutual agreement or understanding, express or implied, between two or
more persons to commit a criminal act or to accomplish a legal act by
unlawful means. While the offense has its origins in the common law, it
is now specifically proscribed by statute, which sets forth the
penalties for its commission. **\[ ... \]**

\"The gist of the offense of conspiracy lies in the unlawful agreement".
**\[ ... \]** The crime is complete upon formation of the agreement;
**\[ ... \]** it is not necessary to establish any overt act in
furtherance of the conspiracy as a component of the crime.[^107]
However, a twofold specific intent is required for conviction: intent to
combine with others, and intent to accomplish the illegal objective.
**\[ ... \]**

It is a settled principle of black-letter law that conspiracy is a crime
that is separate and distinct from the substantive crime that is its
object. **\[ ... \]**The guilt or innocence of a conspirator does not
depend upon the accomplishment of the goals of the conspiracy. More
importantly **\[ ... \]** a conviction of conspiracy does not merge with
a conviction of the completed offense.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xfa71cc44f442f4b37de426264c96680b6ca4ad9)Thus, a defendant may be
convicted and punished for both the conspiracy and the substantive
crime. *Pinkerton v United States,* 328 US 640; 66 S Ct 1180; 90 L Ed
1489 (1946).

Notes and Questions (People v Carter)

 

1.  In People v. Seewald, 879 N.W.2d 237 (Mich. 2016) the court found
    that two defendants guilty of conspiracy who agreed to sign
    petitions, all of which contained valid voter signatures, even
    though neither had collected the signatures. Although the act if
    submitting valid signatures was legal, they did so in an illegal
    manner when they falsely signed that they had collected the
    signatures. Carter points to this. A conspiracy can be "to
    accomplish a legal act by unlawful means." 

2.  Merger. See Model Penal Code § 1.07(1).

### PINKERTON ET AL. v. UNITED STATES.

No. 719.

Supreme Court of United States.

Argued May 1, 1946.

Decided June 10, 1946.

**\[ ... \]**

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Walter and Daniel Pinkerton are brothers who live a short distance from
each other on Daniel\'s farm. They were indicted for violations of the
Internal Revenue Code. The indictment contained ten substantive counts
and one conspiracy count. The jury found Walter guilty on nine of the
substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. It found Daniel guilty
on six of the substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. **\[ ...
\]**

A single conspiracy was charged and proved. **\[ ... \]** Each of the
substantive offenses found was committed pursuant to the conspiracy.
Petitioners therefore contend that the substantive counts became merged
in the conspiracy count, **\[ ... \]**. **\[ ... \]**

It has been long and consistently recognized by the Court that the
commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are
separate and distinct offenses. **\[ ... \]** A conspiracy is a
partnership in crime. *United States* v. *Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,* 310
U.S. 150, 253. It has ingredients, as well as implications, distinct
from the completion of the unlawful project. As stated in *United
States* v. *Rabinowich,* 238 U.S. 78, 88:

> \"For two or more to confederate and combine together to commit or
> cause to be committed a breach of the criminal laws, is an offense of
> the gravest character, sometimes quite outweighing, in injury to the
> public, the mere commission of the contemplated crime. It involves
> deliberate plotting to subvert the laws, educating and preparing the
> conspirators for further and habitual criminal practices. And it is
> characterized by secrecy, rendering it difficult of detection,
> requiring more time for its discovery, and adding to the importance of
> punishing it when discovered.\"

**\[ ... \]**

There is, however, no evidence to show that Daniel participated directly
in the commission of the substantive offenses on which his conviction
has been sustained,[^\[5\]^](#X9f74e8e0fed3e2668ff2ae485e24eb93d6c1097)
although there was evidence to show that these substantive offenses were
in fact committed by Walter in furtherance of the unlawful agreement or
conspiracy existing between the brothers. The question was submitted to
the jury on the theory that each petitioner could be found guilty of the
substantive offenses, if it was found at the time those offenses were
committed petitioners were parties to an unlawful conspiracy and the
substantive offenses charged were in fact committed in furtherance of
it.[^\[6\]^](#X449fdc559e45eae015602f1b78ae4e5bfec7797)

**\[ ... \]**

We have here a continuous conspiracy. There is here no evidence of the
affirmative action on the part of Daniel which is necessary to establish
his withdrawal from it. *Hyde* v. *United States,* 225 U.S. 347, 369. As
stated in that case, \"Having joined in an unlawful scheme, **\[ ...
\]**until he does some act to disavow or defeat the purpose he is in no
situation to claim the delay of the law. As the offense has not been
terminated or accomplished he is still offending. **\[ ... \]**And so
long as the partnership in crime continues, the partners act for each
other in carrying it forward. **\[ ... \]** **\[ ... \]** A scheme to
use the mails to defraud, which is joined in by more than one person, is
a conspiracy. *Cochran* v. *United States,* 41 F.2d 193, 199-200. Yet
all members are responsible, though only one did the mailing. *Cochran*
v. *United States, supra;* *Mackett* v. *United States,* 90 F.2d 462,
464; *Baker* v. *United States,* 115 F.2d 533, 540; *Blue* v. *United
States,* 138 F.2d 351, 359. The governing principle is the same when the
substantive offense is committed by one of the conspirators in
furtherance of the unlawful project. *Johnson* v. *United States,* 62
F.2d 32, 34. The criminal intent to do the act is established by the
formation of the conspiracy. Each conspirator instigated the commission
of the crime. The unlawful agreement contemplated precisely what was
done. It was formed for the purpose. The act done was in execution of
the enterprise. The **\[ ... \]**act of one partner in crime is
attributable to all. **\[ ... \]**we fail to see why **\[ ... \]** acts
in furtherance of the conspiracy are likewise not attributable to the
others for the purpose of holding them responsible for the substantive
offense.

A different case would arise if the substantive offense committed by one
of the conspirators was not in fact done in furtherance of the
conspiracy, did not fall within the \[648\] scope of the unlawful
project, or was merely a part of the ramifications of the plan which
could not be reasonably foreseen as a necessary or natural consequence
of the unlawful agreement. But as we read this record, that is not this
case.

*Affirmed.*

**\[ ... \]**

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, dissenting in part.

The judgment concerning Daniel Pinkerton should be reversed. In my
opinion it is without precedent here and is a dangerous precedent to
establish.

Daniel and Walter, who were brothers living near each other, were
charged in several counts with substantive offenses,**\[ ... \]**The
proof showed that Walter alone committed the substantive crimes. There
was none to establish that Daniel participated in them, aided and
abetted Walter in committing them, or knew that he had done so. Daniel
in fact was in the penitentiary, under sentence for other crimes, when
some of Walter\'s crimes were done.

**\[ ... \]**

\[649\] I think this ruling **\[ ... \]**convicts one man for another\'s
crime **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

, the almost unlimited scope of vicarious responsibility for others\'
acts which follows once agreement is shown, the psychological advantages
of such trials for securing convictions by attributing to one proof
against another, these and other inducements require that the broad
limits of discretion allowed to prosecuting officers in relation to such
charges and trials be not expanded into new, wider and more dubious
areas of choice. **\[ ... \]**

Daniel has been held guilty of the substantive crimes committed only by
Walter on proof that he did no more than conspire with him to commit
offenses of the same general character. There was no evidence that he
counseled, advised or had knowledge of those particular acts or
offenses. There was, therefore, none that he aided, abetted or took part
in them. There was only evidence sufficient to show that he had agreed
with Walter at some past time to engage in such transactions generally.
As to Daniel this was only evidence of conspiracy, not of substantive
crime.

The Court\'s theory seems to be that Daniel and Walter became general
partners in crime by virtue of their agreement and because of that
agreement without more on his part Daniel became criminally responsible
as a principal for everything Walter did thereafter in the nature of a
criminal offense of the general sort the agreement contemplated, so long
as there was not clear evidence that Daniel had withdrawn from or
revoked the agreement. Whether or not his commitment to the penitentiary
had that effect, the result is a vicarious criminal responsibility as
broad as, or broader than, the vicarious civil liability of a partner
for acts done by a co-partner in the course of the firm\'s business.

Such analogies from private commercial law and the law of torts are
dangerous, in my judgment, for transfer to the criminal field. See Sen.
Rep. No. 163, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 20. Guilt there with us remains
personal, not vicarious, for the more serious offenses. It should be
kept so. **\[ ... \]**Without the agreement Daniel was guilty of no
crime on this record. With it and no more, so far as his own conduct is
concerned, he was guilty of two.

Opinion

BAXTER, J.

Defendants Jamal K. Swain and David Chatman were each convicted of
conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes, stemming from the drive-by
shooting death of a 15-year-old boy. As we shall explain, we hold that
intent to kill is a required element of the crime of conspiracy to
commit murder. In light of the jury instructions given, and general
verdicts returned, we cannot determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether
the jury found that the defendants conspired with an intent to kill.
That conclusion requires us to reverse defendants' conspiracy
convictions.

Facts and Procedural Background

The question before us is one of law; the facts found by the Court of
Appeal, summarized below, are not disputed.

Prosecution evidence established that a brown van passed through the
Hunter's Point neighborhood of San Francisco about 2 a.m. on January 13,
1991. It slowed down near the spot where the young victim, who was of
Samoan descent, and his friends were listening to music on the street.

A young Black male who appeared to have no hair was driving the van.
Suddenly several shots were fired from the front of the van. Defendant
Chatman and another young man also fired guns from the rear of the van.
One of the intended victims had yelled out "drive-by" as a warning of
the impending shooting, so most of the people on the street ducked down.
The 15-year-old victim, Hagbom Saileele, who was holding the radio from
which music was playing, was shot twice from behind. He later died in
surgery.

Afterward, defendant Swain was in jail and boasted to jailmates about
what good aim he had with a gun: "He was talking about what a good shot
he was. \[ID \... \[H He was saying he had shot that Samoan kid when
they were in the van going about 30 miles an hour up a hill." The area
where the shooting occurred is hilly; the van would have had to have
been traveling uphill as it passed by the scene of the shooting.

Evidence also established that defendant Swain had used his jailhouse
visiting privileges to threaten and intimidate witnesses into changing
their stories, so that he would not be identified as involved in the
crime.

The abandoned brown van was recovered by police; in the van and nearby
were found surgical gloves, expended cartridges, a hooded ski mask, and
two handguns---a .380-caliber semiautomatic and a .25-caliber automatic.
Defendant Swain's fingerprint was on the inside of the driver's side
window. The forensic evidence established that whoever had used the
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from which the fatal shots were
fired, had been sitting in the driver's side front seat of the van.

The .380-caliber gun was traced, through a series of owners and
transactions involving narcotics, to defendant Chatman. Chatman was
interrogated by police; he denied any knowledge of the van and claimed
he had not purchased the gun. When this story proved false, Chatman
admitted he had bought the gun, but claimed it had been stolen from him.
Still later, he claimed he had sold it to someone else.

A warrant was obtained for Chatman's arrest. After waiving his rights,
Chatman told police he and two other people, not including Swain, had
driven the van to the crime scene in order to get revenge for a car
theft by a rival gang. Chatman insisted, to the police and at trial,
that Swain had not been in the van. He could not, however, explain
Swain's fingerprint inside the van.

The owner of the van testified Swain had never been inside his van prior
to the incident, but that Swain had intimidated him into telling police
he (Swain) had previously been inside the vehicle, since otherwise "he
was going to have something done to him."

At trial, Chatman admitted he had been in the van, which was driven to
Hunter's Point to retaliate for a car theft attributed to a neighborhood
youth who was not the victim of the shooting. The original plan was
allegedly to steal the car of the thief. Chatman admitted he had fired
shots, but claimed he fired wildly and only in self-defense. In support
of this self-defense theory, he testified he heard an initial shot and
thought it was fired by someone outside the van shooting at him, so he
returned the fire. As noted, Chatman claimed Swain was not in the van.

Swain testified he was not in the van during the shooting and did not do
any shooting. He claimed he had entered the van earlier in the evening,
but had left because "the smell of marijuana bothered him." He claimed
he took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to Berkeley, where he spent the
evening at a relative's home. He denied boasting about shooting the
victim and denied having threatened any witnesses.

The jury first returned a verdict finding defendant Chatman guilty of
second degree murder and conspiracy. As instructed, the jury also made a
finding that the target offense of the conspiracy was murder in the
second degree. Several days later, the jury returned verdicts against
defendant Swain, finding him not guilty of murder or its lesser included
offenses, but guilty of conspiracy and of attempting to dissuade a
witness from testifying by threats. Once again, the jury made a finding
under the conspiracy count that the target offense of the conspiracy was
murder in the second degree.

At the sentencing hearing, the parties disputed the proper sentence for
the crime of conspiracy to commit murder, where the target offense is
found by the jury to be murder in the second degree. The trial court
ultimately ruled that the proper sentence was an indeterminate term of
15 years to life, that prescribed for murder in the second degree, not
25 years to life, that prescribed for murder in the first degree, as the
People had argued.

Chatman was sentenced to 15 years to life for second degree murder, with
a consecutive 4-year enhancement for personal firearm use. A sentence of
15 years to life for the conspiracy count was imposed but stayed
pursuant to Penal Code section 654.

Swain was sentenced to 15 years to life for conspiracy, and an
additional 3 years for the conviction of attempting to dissuade a
witness from testifying by threats.

Both defendants appealed on several grounds, including the question of
whether intent to kill is a required element of the crime of conspiracy
to commit murder. More particularly, where, as here, the target offense
is determined to be murder *in the second degree,* does conviction of
conspiracy to commit murder necessarily require proof of express
malice---the functional equivalent of intent to kill---or can one
conspire to commit implied malice murder? The People also appealed,
contending the trial court improperly sentenced defendants to
indeterminate terms of 15 years to life on the conspiracy counts
because, assertedly under Penal Code section 182, every "conspiracy to
commit murder" must be punished as a first degree murder, with a
sentence of 25 years to life. The Court of Appeal affirmed the
convictions and judgments imposing sentence in their entirety.

Defendants and the People each petitioned for review. We granted the
petitions, limiting review to two issues: (1) is intent to kill a
required element of conspiracy to commit murder, and (2) what is the
punishment for conspiracy to commit murder, given the prescripts of
Penal Code section 182?

Discussion

I

Defendants contend the jury should have been instructed that proof of
intent to kill is required to support a conviction of conspiracy to
commit murder, whether the target offense of the
conspiracy---murder---is determined to be in the first or second degree.
More particularly, defendants assert it was error to instruct the jury
on the principles of *implied malice* second degree murder in connection
with the determination of whether they could be found guilty of
conspiracy to commit murder, since *implied malice* does not require a
finding of intent to kill. As we shall explain, we agree.

We commence our analysis with a brief review of the elements of the
crime of conspiracy, and of murder, the target offense of the conspiracy
here in issue.

Conspiracy is an inchoate crime. (See *United States* v. *Feola* (1975)
420 U.S. 671, 694 \[43 L.Ed.2d 541, 558, 95 S.Ct. 1255\].) It does not
require the commission of the substantive offense that is the object of
the conspiracy. *(People* v. *Manson* (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 1, 47 \[139
Cal.Rptr. 275\].) "As an inchoate crime, conspiracy fixes the point of
legal intervention at \[the time of\] agreement to commit a crime," and
"thus reaches further back into preparatory conduct than attempt. . . ."
(Model Pen. Code & Commentaries (1985) com. 1 to § 5.03, pp. 387-388.)

The crime of conspiracy is defined in the Penal Code as "two or more
persons conspiring\]" "\[t\]o commit any crime," together with proof of
the commission of an overt act "by one or more of the parties to such
agreement" in furtherance thereof. (Pen. Code, §§ 182, subd. (a)(1),
184.) "Conspiracy is a 'specific intent' crime. . . . The specific
intent required divides logically into two elements: (a) the intent to
agree, or conspire, and (b) the intent to commit the offense which is
the object of the conspiracy. \... To sustain a conviction for
conspiracy to commit a particular offense, the prosecution must show not
only that the conspirators intended to agree *but also that they
intended to commit the elements of that* offense." *(People* v. *Horn*
(1974) 12 Cal.3d 290, 296 \[115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300\] *(Horn),*
citations omitted, italics added.) In some instances, the object of the
conspiracy "is defined in terms of proscribed conduct." (Model Pen. Code
& Commentaries, *supra,* com. 2(c) to § 5.03, p. 402.) In other
instances, it "is defined in terms of \... a proscribed result under
specified attendant circumstances." *(Ibid.)*[^108]

Another provision of the Penal Code, section 182, the current version of
which was enacted in 1955, prescribes the punishment for the crime of
conspiracy. "If the felony is one for which different punishments are
prescribed for different degrees, the jury or court which finds the
defendant guilty thereof shall determine the degree of the felony
defendant conspired to commit. If the degree is not so determined, the
punishment for conspiracy to commit such felony shall be that prescribed
for the lesser degree, except in the case of conspiracy to commit
murder, in which case the punishment shall be that prescribed for murder
in the first degree."

Turning next to the elements of the target offense of the conspiracy
here in issue, Penal Code section 187 defines the crime of murder as the
"unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought."
(Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a).) Malice aforethought "may be express or
implied." (Pen. Code, § 188.) "It is express when there is manifested a
deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow
creature. It is implied, when no considerable provocation appears, or
when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and
malignant heart." *(Ibid.)*

This court has observed that proof of unlawful "intent to kill" is the
functional equivalent of express malice. (See *People* v. *Saille*
(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1114 \[2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588\]
\["Pursuant to the language of \[Penal Code\] section 188, when an
intentional killing is shown, malice aforethought is
established."\].)[^109]

Penal Code section 189 distinguishes between murders in the first degree
and murders in the second degree. "All murder which is perpetrated by
means of a destructive device or explosive . . . , poison, lying in
wait, torture, *or by any other kind of willful, deliberate, and
premeditated killing,* or which is committed in the perpetration of, or
attempt to perpetrate, \[certain enumerated felonies\], or any murder
which is perpetrated by means of discharging a firearm from a motor
vehicle, intentionally at another person outside of the vehicle with the
intent to inflict death, is *murder of the first degree.* All other
kinds of murders are of the second degree." (Italics added.)[^110]

California law, in turn, recognizes three theories of *second degree*
murder.

The first is unpremeditated murder with express malice. (See CALJIC No.
8.30 \["Murder of the second degree is \[also\] the unlawful killing of
a human being with malice aforethought when there is manifested an
intention unlawfully to kill a human being but the evidence is
insufficient to establish deliberation and premeditation."\].)

The second, of particular concern here, is implied malice murder. (See
CALJIC No. 8.31 \["Murder of the second degree is \[also\] the unlawful
killing of a human being when: \[\*\]\[\] 1. The killing resulted from
an intentional act, \[H 2. The natural consequences of the act are
dangerous to human life, and \[00 3. The act was deliberately performed
with knowledge of the danger to, and with conscious disregard for, human
life. \[00 When the killing is the direct result of such an act, it is
not necessary to establish that the defendant intended that his act
would result in the death of a human being."\].)

The third theory is second degree felony murder. (See CALJIC No. 8.32
\["The unlawful killing of a human being, whether intentional,
unintentional or accidental, which occurs \[during\] \[as the direct
causal result of\] the commission or attempted commission of \[certain
crimes\] is murder of the second degree when the perpetrator had the
specific intent to commit such crime."\] \[Third bracket added\].)

As noted, the jury in this case was instructed on the elements of
murder, including principles of *implied malice* second degree murder.
Under the instructions given, the jury could have based its verdicts
finding defendants guilty of conspiracy to commit murder in the second
degree on a theory of implied malice murder. The Court of Appeal below
concluded it could find no authority supportive of the proposition that
the crime of conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree must be
accompanied by an intent to kill (i.e., express malice). Instead, the
court relied on the holding in *People* v. *Alexander* (1983) 140
Cal.App.3d 647 \[189 Cal.Rptr. 906\] (Alexander), which case suggested
that implied malice is "the most logical route\" to establishing the
crime of "conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree." *(Id.* at
p. 665.) *Alexander,* in turn, purported to place principal reliance on
this court's opinion in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, interpreting
*Horn* as holding that conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree
can be based on a theory of implied malice murder.

As will be explained, *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, did not so hold. Nor
do we find the rationale of *Alexander, supra,* 140 Cal.App.3d 647,
otherwise sound in reasoning or result to the extent it concluded
conspiracy to murder can be grounded on implied malice murder. Before
turning to those cases, some preliminary observations will shed light on
the logical answer to the question at hand.

We have noted that conspiracy is a specific intent crime requiring an
intent to agree or conspire, and a further intent to commit the target
crime, here murder, the object of the conspiracy. Since murder committed
with intent to kill is the functional equivalent of *express malice*
murder, conceptually speaking, no conflict arises between the specific
intent element of conspiracy and the specific intent requirement for
such category of murders. Simply put, where the conspirators agree or
conspire with specific intent to kill and commit an overt act in
furtherance of such agreement, they are guilty of conspiracy to commit
express malice murder. The conceptual difficulty arises when the target
offense of murder is founded on a theory of implied malice, which
requires no intent to kill.

*Implied malice* murder, in contrast to express malice, requires instead
an intent to do some act, the natural consequences of which are
dangerous to human life. *"When the killing is the direct result of such
an act,"* the requisite mental state for murder---malice
aforethought---is implied. (CALJIC No. 8.31, italics added.) In such
circumstances, ". . . it is not necessary to establish that the
defendant intended that his act would result in the death of a human
being." *(Ibid.)* Hence, under an *implied malice* theory of second
degree murder, the requisite mental state for murder---malice
aforethought ---is by definition "implied," as a matter of law, from the
specific intent to do some act dangerous to human life *together with
the circumstance that a killing has resulted from the doing of such
act.*

Stated otherwise, all murders require, at the core of the corpus delicti
of the offense, a "killing." *(People* v. *Cullen* (1951) 37 Cal.2d 614,
624 \[234 P.2d 1\]; *People* v. *Ives* (1941) 17 Cal.2d 459, 463 \[110
P.2d 408\]; 1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, *supra,* Elements of
Crime, § 136, p. 152; 1 Wharton's Criminal Law (15th ed. 1993) §28, p.
172.) "Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice
aforethought." (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a).) But only in the case of
*implied malice* murder is the requisite mental state---malice
aforethought---implied from the specific intent to do some act *other
than* an intentional killing *and* the resulting circumstance: a killing
that has in fact occurred as "the direct result of such an act." (CALJIC
No. 8.31.)

The element of malice aforethought in implied malice murder cases is
therefore derived or "implied," in part through hindsight so to speak,
from (i) proof of the specific intent to do some act dangerous to human
life *and* (ii) the circumstance that a killing has resulted therefrom.
It is precisely due to this nature of *implied malice* murder that it
would be *illogical* to conclude one can be found guilty of conspiring
to commit murder where the requisite element of malice is implied. Such
a construction would be at odds with the very nature of the crime of
conspiracy---an "inchoate" crime that "fixes the point of legal
intervention at \[the time of\] agreement to commit a crime," and indeed
"reaches further back into preparatory conduct than \[the crime of\]
attempt" (Model Pen. Code & Commentaries, *supra,* com. 1 to § 5.03, pp.
387-388)---precisely because commission of the crime could never be
established, or be deemed complete, unless and until a killing actually
occurred.

By analogy, we have reached similar conclusions respecting the nature of
proof of the element of malice required to establish the inchoate crimes
of assault with intent to commit murder and attempted murder.

In *People* v. *Murtishaw* (1981) 29 Cal.3d 733 \[175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631
P.2d 446\] *(Murtishaw),* the defendant was convicted of three counts of
first degree murder and one count of assault with intent to commit
murder, in violation of former Penal Code section 217. (29 Cal.3d at p.
762.)[^111] The jury was instructed that the crime required proof of
specific intent to commit murder, but was further instructed that murder
can be based on express malice, implied malice, or felony murder.
However, the jury was also instructed that for intent to commit murder,
the necessary specific intent "is to unlawfully kill." *(Id.* at p.
763.) This court found such instructions, taken as a whole, were
contradictory in that they defined the requisite mental element of the
offense in two different ways---intent to kill and intent to
murder---and by implication defined the latter to include theories of
murder not requiring intent to kill, i.e., implied malice murder and
felony murder. *(Ibid.;* accord, *People* v. *Coleman* (1989) 48 Cal.3d
112, 137-138 \[255 Cal.Rptr. 813, 768 P.2d 32\]; *People* v. *Johnson*
(1981) 30 Cal.3d 444, 447-449 \[179 Cal.Rptr. 209, 637 P.2d 676\].)

We went on in *Murtishaw, supra,* 29 Cal.3d 733, to observe that
"\[established California authority . . . demonstrates that the concept
of implied malice, insofar as it permits a conviction without proof of
intent to kill, is . . . inapplicable to the assault \[with intent to
commit murder\] charge." *(Id.* at p. 764.) We then explained: "In
*People* v. *Mize* (1889) 80 Cal. 41 \[22 P. 80\], the court instructed
the jury that defendant would be guilty of assault with intent to commit
murder if his acts were such that he could have been convicted of murder
had the victim died. The court held the instruction erroneous: ' "To
constitute murder, the guilty person need not intend to take life; but
to constitute an attempt to murder, he must so intend." \[Citation.\]
"The wrongdoer must specifically contemplate taking life; and though his
act is such as, were it successful, would be murder, if in truth he does
not mean to kill, he does not become guilty of an attempt to commit
murder." ' (80 Cal. at p. 43.) (Accord, *People* v. *Miller* (1935) 2
Cal.2d 527, 532-533 \[42 P.2d 308, 98 A.L.R. 913\].)" *(Murtishaw,
supra,* 29 Cal.3d at p. 764.) We further noted that ". . . once a
defendant intends to kill, any malice he may harbor is necessarily
express malice. Implied malice . . . cannot coexist with a specific
intent to kill. To instruct on implied malice in that setting,
therefore, may confuse the jury by suggesting that they can convict
without finding a specific intent to kill." *(Id.* at pp. 764-765, fn.
omitted.)

Similarly, in *People* v. *Collie* (1981) 30 Cal.3d 43 \[177 Cal.Rptr.
458, 634 P.2d 534\] *(Collie),* we applied the above noted reasoning of
*Murtishaw, supra,* 29 Cal.3d 733, to the crime of attempted murder. To
constitute an attempt, there must be (i) proof of specific intent to
commit the target crime and (ii) a direct, ineffectual act done towards
its commission. (1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, *supra,*
Elements of Crime, § 143, p. 160.) Concluding in *Collie* that the trial
court erred in instructing the jury it could convict the defendant of
attempted murder on the basis of implied malice and without a finding of
intent to kill, we explained: " 'Specific intent to kill is a necessary
element of attempted murder. It must be proved, and it cannot be
inferred merely from the commission of another dangerous crime.'
\[Citation.\]" *(Collie, supra,* 30 Cal.3d at p. 62; accord, *People* v.
*Visciotti* (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1, 58-59 \[5 Cal.Rptr.2d 495, 825 P.2d
388\]; *People* v. *Lee* (1987) 43 Cal.3d 666, 670 \[238 Cal.Rptr. 406,
738 P.2d 752\]; *People* v. *Ratliff* (1986) 41 Cal.3d 675, 695-696
\[224 Cal.Rptr. 705, 715 P.2d 665\].)

Finally, in *People* v. *Bottger* (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 974 \[191
Cal.Rptr. 408\], the court applied reasoning similar to that employed by
this court in *Murtishaw, supra,* 29 Cal.3d 733, and *Collie, supra,* 30
Cal.3d 43, to yet a third inchoate crime related to
murder---solicitation to commit murder. Solicitation is complete upon
the making of the request or proposal, even when the person solicited
immediately rejects it. (1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, *supra,*
Elements of Crime, § 124, p. 143.) Unlike conspiracy, proof of
solicitation requires neither agreement nor commission of an overt act.
*(Ibid.)* Unlike attempt, it requires no direct, unequivocal act toward
the commission of the target offense. *(Id.,* § 143, p. 160.) The
*Bottger* court held that, as with assault with intent to commit murder
and attempted murder, solicitation for murder requires intent to kill
and cannot be based on a theory of implied malice. *(People* v.
*Bottger, supra,* 142 Cal.App.3d at pp. 980-982; see also *People* v.
*Phillips* (1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 77 \[222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423\]
\[citing *Bottger* with approval for the proposition that solicitation
for murder requires specific intent to kill\].)

As noted, the opinion in *Alexander, supra,* 140 Cal.App.3d 647, on
which the Court of Appeal relied in the present case, concluded
conspiracy to commit murder can be based on a theory of implied malice
murder. *(Id.* at p. 665.) The *Alexander* court took note of the
holdings in *Murtishaw, supra,* 29 Cal.3d 733, and *Collie, supra,* 30
Cal.3d 43, but found them inapposite in the context of establishing
malice for conspiracy to commit murder, apparently believing that to do
so would run afoul of this court's holding in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d
290. *(Alexander, supra,* 140 Cal.3d at pp. 665-666.) In this regard the
*Alexander* court erred. We turn, next, to our decision in *Horn.*

The defendants in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, were convicted of
conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree, arson, and the unlawful
manufacture of a firebomb. At trial the defendants presented evidence
suggesting that at the time of the conspiracy they were so intoxicated
they lacked the capacity to harbor malice aforethought, thus making
their unlawful agreement, at most, a conspiracy to commit voluntary
manslaughter. *(Id.* at p. 293.) The trial court, however, refused to
instruct the jury that diminished capacity arising from voluntary
intoxication could reduce a homicide to manslaughter, thus leaving the
jury with an all-or-nothing choice on the conspiracy to commit murder
count. The *Horn* court concluded such refusal to instruct on conspiracy
to commit manslaughter required reversal of the conspiracy to commit
murder counts.

The court in *Horn* recognized that earlier, in *People* v. *Kynette*
(1940) 15 Cal.2d 731 \[104 P.2d 794\] *(Kynette),* we had stated that .
. 'a conspiracy to commit murder can only be a conspiracy to commit
murder of the first degree for the obvious reason that the agreement to
murder necessarily involves the "willful, deliberate and premeditated"
intention to kill a human being.' " *(Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at p. 298,
quoting *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 745.) This was so because, at
the time *Kynette* was decided, premeditation meant merely "advance
planning of the crime." *(Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at p. 298.)

As of the time *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, was decided, however, later
cases had redefined premeditation as "requir\[ing\] proof that the
defendant 'could maturely and meaningfully reflect upon the gravity of
his contemplated act.' \[Citations.\]" *(Id.* at p. 298.) Furthermore,
although a conviction of murder or conspiracy to commit murder in any
degree requires proof of malice aforethought, cases postdating *Kynette,
supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, had held that malice could be rebutted by a
showing that the defendant's mental capacity was reduced by mental
illness, mental defect or intoxication, i.e., recognition of the
"diminished capacity defense." (See *People* v. *Graham* (1969) 71
Cal.2d 303, 315 \[78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153\]; *People* v.
*Gorshen* (1959) 51 Cal.2d 716, 727 \[336 P.2d 492\]; *Horn, supra,* 12
Cal.3d at p. 299.)

The *Horn* court looked to these changes in the law postdating *Kynette,
supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, considered the evidence of Horn's diminished
capacity caused by intoxication, noted the absence of any basis on which
to conclude that the jury, as instructed, had rejected such evidence in
convicting Horn and his codefendant of conspiracy to commit murder, and
concluded it was therefore reversible error to fail to instruct on the
lesser offense of conspiracy to commit manslaughter. *(Horn, supra,* 12
Cal.3d at pp. 300-301.)

More pertinent to our present analysis, nothing in the court's decision
in *Horn* suggests that conspiracy to commit murder can be committed
without intent to kill (express malice). Indeed, looking to the precise
facts of that case, because the conspiracy to murder in *Horn* involved
a firebomb and because, under Penal Code section 189 as then worded,
"\[a\]ll murder which is perpetrated by means of a bomb \... is murder
in the first degree," verdicts of conspiracy to commit murder in the
second degree in *Horn* would have been contrary to law, and the *Horn*
court so recognized. *(Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at pp. 299-300.) In
short, neither the facts of *Horn,* its rationale, nor its holding
mandates the view that conspiracy to commit murder can be based on a
theory of implied malice.

We conclude that a conviction of conspiracy to commit murder requires a
finding of intent to kill, and cannot be based on a theory of implied
malice.

II

The question remains whether the instructions on implied malice in this
case were prejudicial, requiring reversal of defendants' convictions of
conspiracy to commit murder designated by the jury as murder in the
second degree. We conclude the convictions must be reversed.

The jury was instructed on theories of both express and implied malice.
They returned general verdicts, which do not inform us on what theory
they found the requisite element of malice necessary to convict on the
charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Under the implied malice
instructions, the jury could have found malice without finding intent to
kill. (Pen. Code, § 188.) The prosecutor repeatedly referred to implied
malice in the closing arguments, stating at one point that ". . . this
could very easily be an implied malice case."

On this record, under the harmless error test traditionally applied to
misinstruction on the elements of an offense, namely, whether it appears
"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not
contribute to the verdict obtained" *(Chapman* v. *California* (1967)
386 U.S. 18, 24 \[17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065\];
see *People* v. *Harris* (1994) 9 Cal.4th 407, 424-425 \[37 Cal.Rptr.2d
200, 886 P.2d 1193\], and cases cited), reversal is required, for it
cannot be determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous
implied malice murder instructions did not contribute to the convictions
on the conspiracy counts. Nor is there anything else discoverable from
the verdicts that would enable us to conclude that the jury necessarily
found the defendants guilty of conspiracy to commit murder on a proper
theory, i.e., based on express malice or intent to kill. *(People* v.
*Harris, supra, 9* Cal.4th at p. 419.) Defendant Chatman was convicted
of second degree murder, which conviction itself could have been based
on a theory of implied malice; defendant Swain was found not guilty of
murder and its lesser offenses.

That portion of the Court of Appeal's judgment affirming defendants'
convictions of conspiracy to commit murder must therefore be reversed.

III

We are mindful that conceptually difficult questions remain regarding
whether there exists a viable offense of conspiracy to commit express
malice "second degree" murder, and if there be such an offense, what is
the applicable punishment. The question also remains whether defendants
in this case may be retried for conspiracy to commit murder in the first
degree given the jury's determination that they conspired to commit
murder and its further designation of that murder as having been in the
second degree.

Confusion has arisen in the wake of several key changes to the law of
murder and, in particular, to the definition of premeditation, all of
which postdated *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, and which have called into
question the continued validity of certain aspects of that opinion's
holding.

First, the characterization of premeditation upon which *Horn, supra,*
12 Cal.3d 290, relied, namely, a showing that the defendant was able to
" *'maturely and meaningfully reflect upon the gravity of his
contemplated* act' " *(Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at p. 298, italics added,
quoting *People* v. *Wolff* (1964) 61 Cal.2d 795, 821 \[40 Cal.Rptr.
271, 394 P.2d 959\]), has itself passed into history. Seven years after
*Horn* was decided, the Legislature amended Penal Code section 189 to
provide that "To prove the killing was 'deliberate and premeditated,'
*it shall not be necessary to prove the defendant maturely and
meaningfully reflected upon the gravity of his or her act\"* (Stats.
1981, ch. 404, § 7, p. 1593, italics added.)

Second, since *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, was decided, the Legislature
has abolished the defense of diminished capacity. (See Stats. 1981, ch.
404, § 4, p. 1592 \[enacting Pen. Code, § 28\].) As one court has
observed: *"Horn,* decided in 1974, was premised largely on the
continued existence of the diminished capacity defense. In light of the
subsequent legislative abrogation of that defense, we question the
continued validity of *Horn* and *Alexander \[supra,* 140 Cal.App.3d
647\]." *(People* v. *Miller* (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 873, 878, fn. 2 \[8
Cal.Rptr.2d 193\].)

It can be argued that the current statutory definition of premeditation
is once again akin to the definition of premeditation in effect when
this court decided *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, namely, mere
"advanced planning of the crime." Thus, the rationale of *Horn, supra,*
12 Cal.3d 290, would no longer afford any principled basis on which to
distinguish between the mental state required for *conspiracy* to commit
murder; the specific intent to agree and conspire with intent to
kill---and the mental state of *premeditated* first degree murder.
Stated differently, conspiring to murder with the requisite intent to
kill is arguably functionally indistinguishable from the mental state of
premeditating the target offense of murder. If that be the case, then
logically, all conspiracy to commit murder is necessarily "conspiracy to
commit first degree murder," or perhaps more accurately stated,
conspiracy to commit murder *punishable* as first degree murder under
the provisions of Penal Code section 182.

The arguably ambiguous provisions of Penal Code section 182, which, by
their express terms, purport only to prescribe the proper *punishment*
for conspiracy convictions, but which were construed in *Horn, supra,*
12 Cal.3d 290, 298, footnote 5, as creating or authorizing conviction of
the offense of "conspiracy to commit second degree murder," have further
compounded the confusion. The controversial footnote in *Horn* states:
*"Kynette's* assertion that a conspiracy to commit murder is always a
conspiracy to commit first degree murder is inconsistent with the
present language of Penal Code section 182. When *Kynette* was decided,
section 182 provided simply that conspirators to commit a felony 'shall
be punishable in the same manner and to the same extent as provided for
the punishment of the commission of the said felony.' The current
section 182, enacted in 1955, is much more specific: 'If the felony is
one for which different punishments are prescribed for different
degrees, the jury or court which finds the defendant guilty thereof
shall determine the degree of the felony defendant conspired to commit.
If the degree is not so determined, the punishment for conspiracy to
commit such felony shall be that prescribed for the lesser degree,
*except in the case of conspiracy to commit murder, in which case the
punishment shall be that prescribed for murder in the first* degree.'
\[\*j0 As this language is written and punctuated, it plainly authorizes
the trier of fact to return a verdict finding conspiracy to commit
murder in the second degree. *Only* if the trier of fact fails to
determine the degree is a conspiracy to commit murder punished as one to
commit first degree murder. Since the Legislature has authorized a
verdict of conspiracy to commit second degree murder, it clearly does
not believe that crime to be a logical impossibility." *(Horn, supra,*
12 Cal.3d at p. 298, fn. 5, first italics added; second italics in
original.)

The point made in the *Horn* footnote might be refuted by concluding
that the portion of Penal Code section 182 quoted in italics above was
added by the Legislature for the very purpose of effectuating this
court's holding in *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, that is to say, by
expressly providing that all conspiracy to commit murder is conspiracy
to commit murder *in the first degree,* and that hence all such
conspiracies should be punished as first degree murders, with no
consequent requirement that the jury further determine the degree of the
target offense of murder. The *Horn* court's contrary
interpretation---that *"\[o\]nly* if the trier of fact fails to
determine the degree is a conspiracy to commit murder punished as one to
commit first degree murder . . *(Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at p. 298, fn.
5)---does seem at odds with the general proposition, embodied in Penal
Code section 182, that a defendant should receive the benefit of a
jury's failure to designate the degree of the target offense of the
conspiracy.

On the other hand, the relevant language of Penal Code section 182
quoted above, as suggested by the court in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at
page 298, footnote. 5, can literally be read as contemplating verdicts
of "conspiracy to commit second degree murder." Nor would such a verdict
necessarily be inconsistent with the holding we reach today, for one can
be found guilty of *unpremeditated* murder with express malice in the
second degree. (See CALJIC No. 8.30.)

The plain fact remains, however, that the analysis suggested in footnote
5 in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at page 298, was dictum. As already
explained, under the particular facts of that case, had the jury
returned verdicts convicting Horn and his codefendant of "conspiracy to
commit second degree murder," such verdicts would have been contrary to
law as the defendants' plan to use a "bomb" elevated the target offense
to murder in the first degree as a matter of law. Furthermore, the
provisions of Penal Code section 182 are expressly addressed to the
proper *punishment* for conspiracy, including conspiracy to commit
murder. Punishment was simply not at issue in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d
290. " 'It is the general rule that the language of an opinion must be
construed with reference to the facts presented by the case, and the
positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.'
"" *(Brown* v. *Kelly Broadcasting Co.* (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 734-735
\[257 Cal.Rptr. 708, *111* P.2d 406\], quoting *River Farms Co.* v.
*Superior Court* (1933) 131 Cal.App. 365, 369 \[21 P.2d 643\]; accord,
*Security Pacific National Bank* v. *Wozab* (1990) 51 Cal.3d 991,
1003-1004 \[275 Cal.Rptr. 201, 800 P.2d 557\].)

Perhaps the lesson bears repeating here. We have determined that
defendants' convictions for conspiracy to commit murder in the second
degree must be reversed. The issue of proper punishment for those
convictions is therefore no longer in controversy before us and is moot.
Moreover, in light of our determination that reversal of the conspiracy
convictions is compelled, the question of former jeopardy, or any other
question regarding further proceedings, is premature unless and until
the People elect to pursue such further proceedings and, in particular,
seek to retry defendants on the theory of conspiracy to commit first
degree murder. (See *People* v. *McDonald* (1984) 37 Cal.3d 351,
383-384, fn. 31 \[208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709, 46 A.L.R.4th 1011\].)
We therefore leave the determination of those questions for another day.

Conclusion

To the extent the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirmed defendants'
convictions of conspiracy to commit murder, it is reversed. In all other
respects the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.

Lucas, C. J., George, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.

MOSK, J.

I concur in the judgment.

In this cause, we are presented with important questions concerning the
crime of conspiracy to commit murder and the punishment prescribed
therefor. I offer the following answers.[^112]

I. *The Legal Framework*

Let us begin by setting out the legal framework.

The first step concerns the crime of conspiracy. Penal Code section 182
expressly defines the crime of conspiracy to include the situation
wherein "two or more persons conspire" "\[t\]o commit any crime."
*(Id.,* subd. (a)(1).) Penal Code section 184 impliedly defines a
conspiracy to commit a crime as an agreement "to effect \[its\] object."
It also requires that an overt act, "beside such agreement, be done
within this state . . . ." *(Ibid.)* For some crimes, the object "is
defined in terms of proscribed conduct. . . ." (Model Pen. Code &
Commentaries (1985) com. 2(c) to § 5.03, p. 402.) For others, it "is
defined in terms of . . . a proscribed result under specified attendant
circumstances . . . ." *(Ibid.)*

The second step relates to the crime of murder. Penal Code section 187
defines the crime of murder as the "unlawful killing of a human being,
or a fetus, with malice aforethought." *(Id.,* subd. (a).) Penal Code
section 188, in turn, provides that malice aforethought "may be express
or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate
intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature. It is
implied, when no considerable provocation appears, or when the
circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant
heart."[^113] Penal Code section 189 declares that all murder that is
(1) "perpetrated \... by any . . . kind of willful, deliberate, and
premeditated killing," (2) "committed in the perpetration of, or attempt
to perpetrate," certain enumerated felonies, or (3) "perpetrated by
means of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, intentionally at
another person outside of the vehicle with the intent to inflict death,"
is "murder of the first degree. All other kinds of murders are of the
second degree."[^114]

The third step proceeds from the first and second, and involves the
crime of conspiracy to commit murder. Read together, Penal Code sections
182, 184, 187, 188, and 189 define the crime of conspiracy to commit
murder--- the object of which "is defined in terms of \... a proscribed
result under specified attendant circumstances" (Model Pen. Code &
Commentaries, *supra,* com. 2(c) to § 5.03, p. 402)---as the agreement
by two or more persons, accompanied by an overt act, to effect a killing
that is unlawful under the circumstances as they are believed to be and
that is reflective of malice aforethought (see *id.,* com. 2 to § 5.03,
p. 394 \[stating that "the actor's liability is measured from the
situation as he views it"\]). So defined, the crime of conspiracy to
commit murder requires two kinds of "intent" strictly so called. One is
intent to join together in a common endeavor; else, there is no
*conspiracy* to commit murder. The other is intent to kill unlawfully:
else, there is no conspiracy to commit murder.[^115] The offense does
not require, as a factual matter, a *premeditated and deliberate* intent
to kill unlawfully. But an intent of such character is present in the
context of a conspiracy, practically by definition, because it does not
arise of a sudden within a single person but is necessarily formed and
then shared by at least two persons. (Cf. *People* v. *Ruiz* (1988) 44
Cal.3d 589, 614 \[244 Cal.Rptr. 200, 749 P.2d 854\] \[concluding that
murder by lying in wait is, by definition, a kind of "willful,
deliberate, and premeditated killing" within the meaning of Penal Code
section 189, and does not require as a factual matter a premeditated and
deliberate intent to kill unlawfully or even a simple intent to kill
unlawfully\].)

II\. *Kynette and Horn*

Absent from the legal framework set out above are the two decisions that
generate the conflict that we must here resolve concerning the crime of
conspiracy to commit murder and the punishment prescribed therefor:
*People* v. *Kynette* (1940) 15 Cal.2d 731 \[104 P.2d 794\] (hereafter
sometimes *Kynette),* overruled on another point in *People* v. *Snyder*
(1958) 50 Cal.2d 190, 197 \[324 P.2d 1\], and *People* v. *Horn* (1974)
12 Cal.3d 290 \[115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300\] (hereafter sometimes
*Horn).*

In *Kynette,* we expressly held that "a conspiracy to commit murder can
only be a conspiracy to commit murder of the first degree for the
obvious reason that the agreement to murder necessarily involves the
'willful, deliberate and premeditated' intention to kill a human being."
*(People* v. *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 745.) Inasmuch as it
encompasses malice aforethought, in fact *express* malice aforethought,
such an "intention" distinguishes murder from other homicide. Also, by
its very terms, it differentiates murder of the first degree in one of
its forms from murder of the second degree.

In *Kynette,* we thereby impliedly held that the crime of conspiracy to
commit murder is properly conspiracy to commit murder *simpliciter.*
Under its reasoning, it is erroneous to speak of a "crime" of
"conspiracy to commit murder *of the second degree"\',* "a conspiracy to
commit murder can only be a conspiracy to commit murder of the first
degree" *(People* v. *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 745). Similarly,
it is unnecessary to label the crime "conspiracy to commit murder *of
the first degree"\',* there is no crime of "conspiracy to commit murder
*of the second---or any other---degree"* from which it may be
distinguished.

In *Horn,* however, this court---over my dissent---disapproved *Kynette*
on these points. The *Horn* court recognized a "crime" of "conspiracy to
commit murder of the second degree" in addition to one of "conspiracy to
commit murder of the first degree."

In the course of its analysis, the *Horn* court proceeded to reject, on
its own terms, Kynette's holding that "a conspiracy to commit murder can
only be a conspiracy to commit murder of the first degree" because the
"agreement to murder necessarily involves" both malice aforethought and
a premeditated and deliberate intent to kill unlawfully. *(People* v.
*Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 745.)

One of the *Horn* court's reasons was, substantially, that an "agreement
to murder" might not entail a premeditated and deliberate intent to kill
unlawfully because the latter then "require\[d\] proof that the
defendant 'could maturely and meaningfully reflect upon the gravity of
his contemplated act.' " *(People* v. *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at p.
298.) In *People* v. *Wolff* (1964) 61 Cal.2d 795, 821 \[40 Cal.Rptr.
271, 394 P.2d 959\], from which *Horn's* quotation is taken, we had held
that the "true test" of a premeditated and deliberate intent to kill
unlawfully was such.

The other of the *Horn* court's reasons was to the effect that an
"agreement to murder" might not entail a premeditated and deliberate
intent to kill unlawfully or even malice aforethought because the
threshold of proof therefor had been raised, in practice, by imposition
on the prosecution of the burden to rebut any defense of diminished
capacity. In *People* v. *Wells* (1949) 33 Cal.2d 330 \[202 P.2d 53\],
disapproved on another point in *People* v. *Wetmore* (1978) 22 Cal.3d
318, 327, footnote, 7 \[149 Cal.Rptr. 265, 583 P.2d 1308\], and *People*
v. *Gorshen* (1959) 51 Cal.2d 716 \[336 P.2d 492\], also disapproved on
another point in *People* v. *Wetmore, supra,* 22 Cal.3d at pages 324,
footnote 5, and 327, footnote 7, and their progeny, we had established
that defense, which was available to negate all mental states other than
so-called "general criminal intent" (see generally, 1 Witkin & Epstein,
Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Defenses, §§ 208-209, pp. 237-240),
including premeditated and deliberate intent to kill unlawfully (see,
e.g., *People* v. *Wolff, supra,* 61 Cal.2d at pp. 818-822) and malice
aforethought (see, e.g., *People* v. *Conley* (1966) 64 Cal.2d 310, 318
\[49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911\]). "\[A\] conviction of murder in any
degree," says *Horn,* "requires proof of malice aforethought; since
*People* v. *Gorshen* (1959) 51 Cal.2d 716, 727 \[336 P.2d 492\], malice
can be rebutted 'by a showing that the defendant's mental capacity was
reduced by mental illness, mental defect or intoxication.' " *(People*
v. *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at pp. 298-299, quoting *People* v. *Graham*
(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303, 315 \[78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153\].) "Since
evidence of diminished mental capacity can show that a homicide was
committed without premeditation or malice aforethought, reducing that
homicide to second degree murder or manslaughter, such evidence may also
serve to classify a conspiracy to commit a homicide as one to commit
second degree murder or manslaughter." *(People* v. *Horn, supra,* 12
Cal.3d at p. 295.)

In a footnote, the *Horn* court added: *"Kynette's* assertion that a
conspiracy to commit murder is always a conspiracy to commit first
degree murder is inconsistent with the present language of Penal Code
section 182. When *Kynette* was decided, section 182 provided simply
that conspirators to commit a felony 'shall be punishable in the same
manner and to the same extent as provided for the punishment of the
commission of the said felony.' The current section 182, enacted in
1955, is much more specific: 'If the felony is one for which different
punishments are prescribed for different degrees, the jury or court
which finds the defendant guilty thereof shall determine the degree of
the felony defendant conspired to commit. If the degree is not so
determined, the punishment for conspiracy to commit such felony shall be
that prescribed for the lesser degree, except in the case of conspiracy
to commit murder, in which case the punishment shall be that prescribed
for murder in the first degree.' \[\<fl\] As this language is written
and punctuated, it plainly authorizes the trier of fact to return a
verdict finding conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree. *Only*
if the trier of fact fails to determine the degree is a conspiracy to
commit murder punished as one to commit first degree murder. Since the
Legislature has authorized a verdict of conspiracy to commit second
degree murder, it clearly does not believe that crime to be a logical
impossibility." *(People* v. *Horn, supra, 12* Cal.3d at p. 298, fn. 5,
italics in original.)

What are we to do with *Kynette* and Horn?

On its very face, *Kynette* is persuasive. Its words, which are quoted
above, need merely be reread to prove the point.

The same cannot be said of *Horn,*

Judged within the legal framework set out above, *Horn* has been wanting
from the day it was decided.

But let me not press the point. For argument's sake only, I shall assume
that, when it was handed down, *Horn* was good law. It is no longer.

To the extent that the *Horn* court believed that an "agreement to
murder" might not entail a premeditated and deliberate intent to kill
unlawfully because the latter then "require\[d\] proof that the
defendant 'could maturely and meaningfully reflect upon the gravity of
his contemplated act . . .'" *(People* v. *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at p.
298), it has been passed by. It is true that, prior to *Horn,* we had
held in *People* v. *Wolff, supra,* 61 Cal.2d at page 821, that the
"true test" of a premeditated and deliberate intent to kill unlawfully
was such. But it is also true that, after *Horn,* the Legislature
overruled us on that very point. Specifically, it amended Penal Code
section 189 through the addition of the following sentence (Stats. 1981,
ch. 404, § 7, p. 1593), which remains in the provision today: "To prove
the killing was 'deliberate and premeditated,' it shall not be necessary
to prove that the defendant maturely and meaningfully reflected upon the
gravity of his or her act."

Furthermore, to the extent that the *Horn* court believed that an
"agreement to murder" might not entail a premeditated and deliberate
intent to kill unlawfully or even malice aforethought because the
threshold of proof therefor had been raised, in practice, by imposition
on the prosecution of the burden to rebut any defense of diminished
capacity, it has been passed by on this matter as well. At the same time
that it amended Penal Code section 189 as indicated above, the
Legislature added section 28, subdivision (b), to the same code (Stats.
1981, ch. 404, § 4, p. 1592), which expressly abolished the defense: "As
a matter of public policy there shall be no defense of diminished
capacity . \..." A year later, the people added section 25, subdivision
(a), to the code (Prop. 8, Primary Elec. (June 8, 1982) § 4), which
abolished the defense even more expressly: "The defense of diminished
capacity is hereby abolished. \..."

What remains of *Horn* is its footnote quoting Penal Code section 182,
which in pertinent part is virtually the same now as then: "If the
felony is one for which different punishments are prescribed for
different degrees, the jury or court which finds the defendant guilty
thereof shall determine the degree of the felony defendant conspired to
commit. If the degree is not so determined, the punishment for
conspiracy to commit the felony shall be that prescribed for the lesser
degree, except in the case of conspiracy to commit murder, in which case
the punishment shall be that prescribed for murder in the first degree."
*(Id.,* subd. (a).)

When we construe Penal Code 182, as we must, in its full context (see
*Kopp* v. *Fair Pol. Practices Com.* (1995) 11 Cal.4th 607, 673 \[47
Cal.Rptr.2d 108, 905 P.2d 1248\] (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.)), we find
therein the Legislature's acquiescence in Kynette---express as to the
punishment prescribed for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder,
implied as to the crime itself. We read the provision to contain the
words in italics: "If the felony is one for which different punishments
are prescribed for different degrees, the jury or court which finds the
defendant guilty thereof shall determine the degree of the felony
defendant conspired to commit, *except in the case of murder.* If the
degree is not so determined, the punishment for conspiracy to commit the
felony shall be that prescribed for the lesser degree, except in the
case of conspiracy to commit murder, in which case the punishment shall
be that prescribed for murder in the first degree."

Were we to construe Penal Code section 182 otherwise, we would bring
difficulties on ourselves---difficulties that we could and should avoid.
As a doctrinal matter, we would be compelled to deviate from the general
rule--- stated in Penal Code section 182 itself and also in Penal Code
sections 1157 and 1192---that gives the benefit of the trier of fact's
nondetermination of the degree of a felony to the defendant. Moreover,
as an historical matter, we would be forced to embrace two dubious
conclusions. One would be that the Legislature impliedly acknowledged
that the "crime" of "conspiracy to commit murder of the second degree"
existed about 15 years after we had all but expressly declared in
*Kynette* that it did not. The other would be that the Legislature
intended to expose to the death penalty any person convicted of the
"crime" of "conspiracy to commit murder of the second degree" who had
had the misfortune to be tried by a jury or court that was unable to
determine the degree of the "conspired" murder, or that did in fact
determine the degree to be the second but failed to so specify. That is
because, pursuant to Penal Code section 190 as it then stood (Stats.
1927, ch. 889, § 1, p. 1952), the punishment for the crime of murder of
the first degree included death.[^116]

Therefore, to the question, "What are we to do with *Kynette* and
Horn?," my answer is, "We should overrule *Horn* and approve Kynette."
Of course, we need not do so as a formal matter. *Kynette* approves
itself. As stated, it is persuasive on its very face. In addition,
*Horn* has been overruled for all practical purposes through the
legislative abrogation of its premises. It is now a citation without
substance. It falls of its own weight.

III\. *The Present Proceeding*

Let us now turn to the present proceeding.

The Grand Jury of the City and County of San Francisco handed up to the
superior court an indictment against Jamal K. Swain and David Chatman.
In count 1, it charged both Swain and Chatman with the crime of murder;
it alleged, inter alia, that the offense was "wilful, deliberate, and
premeditated," and also, for enhancement of sentence, that both men were
armed with (Pen. Code, § 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and personally used
*(id,.,* § 12022.5, subd. (a)), a firearm in its commission. In count 2,
it charged both Swain and Chatman with the crime of conspiracy to commit
murder. In count 3, it charged Swain alone with the crime of the
felonious intimidation of a witness. *(Id.,* § 136.1, subd. (c)(1).) In
count 4, it charged Swain alone with the same crime as to another
witness. Swain and Chatman each pleaded not guilty to the charges and
denied the allegations. On Swain's motion, the superior court severed
count four for a separate trial. It subsequently ordered dismissal
thereof. Apparently, it also ordered dismissal of the arming
allegations.

Trial on counts 1, 2, and 3 was by jury. As to count 1, the jury found
Swain not guilty of the crime of murder and not guilty of the lesser
included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter; by
contrast, it found Chatman guilty of the crime of murder of the second
degree, and found true the allegation of personal use of a firearm. As
to count 2, it found Swain guilty of the "crime" of "conspiracy to
commit murder of the second degree"; it made the same finding as to
Chatman. As to count 3, it found Swain guilty of the crime of the
felonious intimidation of a witness.

The superior court rendered separate judgments against Swain and
Chat-man. It imposed on Swain a term of imprisonment for 15 years to
life for the "crime" of "conspiracy to commit murder of the second
degree"; it also imposed 3 years for the crime of the felonious
intimidation of a witness, to be served consecutively; finally, it
imposed a restitutionary fine in the amount of \$200 (Gov. Code, §
13967). It imposed on Chatman a term of imprisonment for 15 years to
life for the crime of murder of the second degree with 4 additional
years for personal use of a firearm in its commission; it also imposed
15 years to life for the "crime" of "conspiracy to commit murder of the
second degree,\" but stayed execution thereof (Pen. Code, § 654);
finally, it imposed a restitutionary fine in the amount of \$200.

The Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Five, affirmed
the judgments against Swain and Chatman in their entirety.

On separate petitions by the People, Swain, and Chatman, we granted
review. As will appear, the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be
reversed to the extent that it affirms the superior court's judgments
against Swain and Chatman convicting them of, and sentencing them for,
the "crime" of "conspiracy to commit murder of the second degree."

The first question, which is general, is whether there is a crime of
conspiracy to commit murder *simpliciter* or instead a "crime" of
"conspiracy to commit murder *of the first* degree" and/or a "crime" of
"conspiracy to commit murder *of the second degree.\"* For the reasons
stated above, the answer is that only the former offense exists.

The second question, which is also general, is whether the crime of
conspiracy to commit murder requires an intent to kill unlawfully. For
the reasons stated above, the answer is that it does.

The third question, which is general as well, is what is the punishment
for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder. For the reasons stated
above, the answer is that it is the punishment for the crime of murder
of the first degree---which, pursuant to Penal Code section 190,
subdivision (a), is now imprisonment for a term of 25 years to
life.[^117]

The fourth question, which is specific to this cause, is whether the
judgments convicting Swain and Chatman of, and sentencing them for, the
"crime" of "conspiracy to commit murder of the second degree" must be
reversed. The answer is that reversal is indeed required. Because each
judgment involves a "crime" that does not exist, it is unsupported as a
matter of law and hence cannot stand. (See *In re James M.* (1973) 9
Cal.3d 517, 519-522 \[108 Cal.Rptr. 89, 510 P.2d 33\].) In a given case,
it may be possible to determine that a judgment effectively convicts a
defendant of, and sentences him for, the crime of conspiracy to commit
murder *simpliciter,* albeit under the label of "conspiracy to commit
murder of the second degree." In a case of that sort, the judgment may
be affirmed because the label may be disregarded. This is not such a
case. It appears that we could determine that the judgments against
Swain and Chatman effectively convicted them of, and sentenced them for,
the crime of conspiracy to commit murder only if we could conclude that
such judgments rested on an at least implied finding by the jury that
intent to kill unlawfully was present. On my review of the record, we
cannot so conclude.

The fifth question, which is also specific to this cause, is whether
either Swain or Chatman or both may be retried for the crime of
conspiracy to commit murder without offense to the double jeopardy
clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as made
applicable to the states through the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The answer is that both men may in fact be
retried. To be sure, the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy clause
"protects against a second prosecution for the same offense" both "after
acquittal" and "after conviction." *(North Carolina* v. *Pearce* (1969)
395 U.S. 711, 717 \[23 L.Ed.2d 656, 664-665, 89 S.Ct. 2072\].) But
neither man was expressly *convicted* of the crime of conspiracy to
commit murder *simpliciter;* neither was expressly *acquitted* thereof.
Furthermore, as explained in the preceding paragraph, we cannot conclude
that either man was impliedly *convicted* of the crime under the label
of "conspiracy to commit murder of the second degree"; neither, I
believe, can we conclude that either was impliedly *acquitted*
thereunder.

The sixth and final question, which is specific to this cause as well,
is what is the punishment that may be imposed on Swain or Chatman in the
event that he is convicted of the crime of conspiracy to commit murder
on retrial. The answer is that it is the punishment for the "crime" of
"conspiracy to commit murder of the second degree"---which, pursuant to
*Horn,* is imprisonment for a term of 15 years to life. That is because
a retroactive application of the law as herein declared would "make\[\]
more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission"
*(Beazell* v. *Ohio* (1925) 269 U.S. 167, 169 \[70 L.Ed. 216, 217, 46
S.Ct. 68\]; accord, *Collins* v. *Youngblood* (1990) 497 U.S. 37, 42
\[111 L.Ed.2d 30, 38-39, 110 S.Ct. 2715\]), and would thereby violate
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (see *Bouie* v. *City
of Columbia* (1964) 378 U.S. 347, 352-354 \[12 L.Ed.2d 894, 899-900, 84
S.Ct. 1697\]; see also *In re Baert* (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 514, 518
\[252 Cal.Rptr. 418\] (per Arabian, J.)).[^118]

IV\. *Conclusion*

For the foregoing reasons, I join the majority in concluding that the
judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed to the extent that it
affirms the superior court's judgments against Swain and Chatman
convicting them of, and sentencing them for, the "crime" of "conspiracy
to commit murder of the second degree."

Arabian, J., concurred.

KENNARD, J.

I concur in the majority's holding, set forth in parts I and II of the
majority opinion, that an unlawful intent to kill (what our law terms
"express malice") is an element of conspiracy to commit murder. The
majority, however, does not reach the issue of whether conspiracy to
commit murder is divided into degrees with differing punishments. Left
unanswered, therefore, is this question: Is there conspiracy to commit
first degree murder and conspiracy to commit second degree
express-malice murder, or only conspiracy to commit murder? Unlike the
majority, I would decide this issue, as it is likely to arise on remand
and is of widespread significance to the law governing murder
conspiracies, thus necessitating guidance to the bench and bar.

In deciding it, I would adhere to this court's view in *People* v.
*Horn* (1974) 12 Cal.3d 290 \[115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300\] that
conspiracy to commit first degree murder and conspiracy to commit second
degree murder are separate crimes distinguished by whether the intent to
kill reflected in the conspirators' agreement is deliberate and
premeditated or not. I would further conclude that under the Penal Code,
each type of conspiracy to murder is subject to the punishment
prescribed for the corresponding degree of murder.

I

As relevant here, defendants David Chatman and Jamal K. Swain were
charged with murder and with conspiracy to commit murder. The trial
court instructed the jury that murder required malice, that malice could
be express or implied, and that conspiracy to commit murder required the
specific intent to commit first or second degree murder. The
instructions thus permitted the jury to find defendants guilty of
conspiracy to commit second degree murder on an implied malice theory,
that is, without finding they had the intent to kill. The jury convicted
Chatman of second degree murder and conspiracy to commit second degree
murder; it convicted Swain of conspiracy to commit second degree murder
but acquitted him of murder. On the conspiracy conviction, the trial
court sentenced each defendant to prison for 15 years to life, the
punishment for second degree murder. Defendants appealed, contending
that conspiracy to murder requires intent to kill as one of its
elements; the People also appealed, contending that all conspiracies to
murder were subject to a prison sentence of 25 years to life, the
punishment for first degree murder. The Court of Appeal affirmed the
judgments in their entirety.

II

I agree with the majority that conspiracy to murder requires proof of an
unlawful intent to kill. I would, however, also decide the further
question of whether there are separate crimes of conspiracy to commit
first degree murder and of conspiracy to commit second degree
express-malice murder, or whether conspiracy to commit murder is a
unitary crime requiring only intent to kill. As I noted at the outset,
the issue is a significant one affecting the jury instructions to be
given in every murder conspiracy case and will inevitably arise if
defendants are retried. As Justice Mosk notes in his concurring opinion,
this court has in the past addressed issues likely to arise on remand of
a case, and should do so here as well.

Penal Code section 182 (hereafter section 182) makes it unlawful for
"(a) . . . two or more persons \[to\] conspire: \[\^Q (1) \[t\]o commit
any crime" and establishes the punishment for conspiracies, including
murder conspiracies. For crimes divided according to degree, section 182
provides for the following punishment: "If the felony is one for which
different punishments are prescribed for different degrees, the jury or
court which finds the defendant guilty thereof shall determine the
degree of the felony defendant conspired to commit. If the degree is not
so determined, the punishment for conspiracy to commit the felony shall
be that prescribed for the lesser degree, except in the case of
conspiracy to commit murder, in which case the punishment shall be that
prescribed for murder in the first degree.\" I shall refer to this as
the punishment language of section 182.

The crime of murder is divided into degrees. At the time the murder at
issue in this case occurred, Penal Code section 189 defined first degree
murder as (1) "any . . . kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated
killing" (including killings accomplished by any of a variety of
statutorily designated methods, the use of which in effect establishes
deliberation and premeditation as a matter of law) or (2) murders
"committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate," certain
designated felonies (commonly referred to as felony murder). "All other
kinds of murders are of the second degree.\" (Pen. Code, § 189.) First
and second degree murder have different punishments. (Pen. Code, § 190.)
Because murder is a crime "for which different punishments are
prescribed for different degrees" (§ 182), the punishment language of
section 182 on its face divides murder conspiracies into degrees, just
as it does other crimes for which different punishments are prescribed
for different degrees.

To understand the debate over whether the current version of section 182
divides conspiracy to murder into degrees, however, it is necessary to
begin with *People* v. *Kynette* (1940) 15 Cal.2d 731 \[104 P.2d 794\]
(hereafter *Kynette),* which was decided when a different version of
section 182 was in effect. At that time, section 182 provided that a
conspiracy was "punishable in the same manner and to the same extent as
in this code provided for the punishment of the commission of the said
felony." (Former § 182, as amended by Stats. 1919, ch. 125, § 1, p. 170;
*Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 744.) The defendant in *Kynette*
argued that the trial court improperly excluded jurors with reservations
against the death penalty because, he contended, the death penalty (a
possible penalty for first degree murder) was not a possible punishment
for conspiracy to commit murder. *(Id.* at p. 744.) Thus, the issue was
whether the penalty for first degree murder was a possible penalty for a
conspiracy to commit murder.

In *Kynette,* this court held that the death penalty was a possible
punishment for conspiracy to commit murder. *(Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d
at p. 745.) It reasoned that all conspiracies to commit murder were
necessarily conspiracies to commit first degree murder. *(Ibid.)*

In 1955, 15 years after *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, the Legislature
changed the punishment language of section 182 to provide as follows:
"If the felony is one for which different punishments are prescribed for
different degrees, the jury or court which finds the defendant guilty
thereof shall determine the degree of the felony defendant conspired to
commit. If the degree is not so determined, the punishment for
conspiracy to commit such felony shall be that prescribed for the lesser
degree, except in the case of conspiracy to commit murder, in which case
the punishment shall be that prescribed for murder in the first degree."
(§ 182, as amended by Stats. 1955, ch. 660, § 1, p. 1155.) The
punishment language of section 182 remains substantially the same today.

Almost 20 years after the Legislature altered section 182, this court
addressed the effect of those changes on conspiracy to commit murder in
*People* v. *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290 (hereafter *Horn).* In that
case, the court concluded that conspiracies to kill could take the form
of conspiracies to commit first degree murder, conspiracies to commit
second degree murder, and conspiracies to commit manslaughter. *(Id.* at
pp. 298-300 & fn. 5.) In doing so, the court relied on three reasons:
the existence of the diminished capacity defense; the then-existing
requirement that for premeditation to exist the defendant must have
"maturely and meaningfully reflect\[ed\] \[on\] the gravity of his
contemplated act" *(People* v. *Wolff* (1964) 61 Cal.2d 795, 821 \[40
Cal.Rptr. 271, 394 P.2d 959\], italics omitted); and the post *-Kynette*
changes to the punishment for murder conspiracies set forth in section
182. *(Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at pp. 298-300 & fn. 5.) The court
disapproved *Kynette* to the extent it was inconsistent. *(Horn, supra,
12* Cal.3d at p. 301, fn. 8.)

As the majority notes, the first two reasons set forth in the *Horn*
decision *(supra, 12* Cal.3d 290) supporting the division of murder
conspiracies into degrees---the existence of the diminished capacity
defense and the "mature and meaningful reflection requirement"---are no
longer the law. (Maj. opn., *ante,* at p. 608.) There remains, however,
the punishment language of section 182.

The natural reading of the punishment language of section 182 makes
conspiracies to murder punishable by degree, just as conspiracies to
commit other crimes are punishable by degree. The first sentence of the
punishment language of section 182 ("If the felony is one for which
different punishments are prescribed for different degrees, the jury or
court which finds the defendant guilty thereof shall determine the
degree of the felony defendant conspired to commit.") requires the trier
of fact to ascertain the degree of the crime that is the object of the
conspiracy, and thereby impliedly makes the punishment for the
conspiracy the punishment for that degree of the crime. The second
sentence of the punishment language of section 182 ("If the degree is
not so determined, the punishment for conspiracy to commit the felony
shall be that prescribed for the lesser degree, except in the case of
conspiracy to commit murder, in which case the punishment shall be that
prescribed for murder in the first degree.") states that when the degree
is not determined, the punishment is to be for the lesser degree
*except* in the case of murder, which is punished in the first degree.
By its terms, the murder conspiracy exception just referred to is
limited to cases in which the jury has not determined the degree; it is
not an exception removing murder conspiracies entirely from
classification and punishment by degree. Thus, *Horn* correctly
concluded that, "\[a\]s this language is written and punctuated, it
plainly authorizes the trier of fact to return a verdict finding
conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree." *(Horn, supra,* 12
Cal.3d at p. 298, fn. 5.) Nor is there any evidence of a contrary
legislative intent underlying the enactment of section 182.

When this analysis of section 182 is coupled with our holding today that
conspiracy to murder requires an unlawful intent to kill, the result is
that a conspiracy to murder may be either a conspiracy to commit first
degree murder or a conspiracy to commit second degree express-malice
murder. The degree of the murder conspiracy depends on whether the
conspirators' agreement evidences a willful, deliberate, premeditated
intent to kill of the type that distinguishes first degree murder or
instead reflects only a bare intent to kill lacking in premeditation and
deliberation.[^119] Reading section 182 as dividing conspiracy to murder
into degrees, the punishment for each degree of conspiracy to commit
murder is that for the underlying degree of murder. If the trier of fact
fails to determine the degree, the conspiracy is subject to the
punishment for first degree murder.

The reason for this structure of conspiracy to murder is readily
apparent. If conspiracy to murder were a unitary crime that required
only intent to kill, which is the mental state of second degree murder,
but was punished as first degree murder, then conspiracies that involve
agreements to commit only the elements of second degree murder (e.g.,
that lack premeditation and deliberation) would be punished more
severely than the completed crime of second degree murder.

There is an additional reason for adhering to *Horn's* conclusion that
conspiracy to commit murder is divided by degrees. *Horn* has been the
law for 21 years. During that time, the Legislature has not amended
section 182 to change the understanding of murder conspiracy set forth
in *Horn.* Therefore, the prudent and preferable course is to retain
*Horn's* structure of conspiracy to murder as a crime divided into
degrees with different punishments for each degree. If the Legislature
wishes to alter this structure of conspiracy to murder, it can do so.
That significant policy decision, however, should be left to the
Legislature.

Finally, I note that as a factual matter the crime of conspiracy to
commit second degree express-malice murder applies only to a narrow
range of cases---those in which conspirators formed an agreement to kill
but made that agreement without deliberation and premeditation. It seems
doubtful that any agreement persisting beyond more than the briefest
duration would lack deliberation and premeditation, for inevitably the
passage of time alone would cause the agreement to become deliberate and
premeditated.

III

Justice Mosk, however, comes to a different conclusion than I have
reached. He concludes that conspiracy to murder is a unitary crime that
requires only intent to kill but is subject to the punishment for first
degree murder. He therefore rejects this court's view *(Horn, supra,* 12
Cal.3d 290) that the punishment language of section 182 recognizes the
crime of conspiracy to commit second degree murder.

Although Justice Mosk relies on *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, in
reaching this conclusion, in my view *Kynette* does not really support
his position. As the majority notes, proof of conspiracy requires proof
that the conspirators intended to commit the elements of the offense
that is the object of the conspiracy. (Maj. opn., *ante,* at p. 600.) In
*Kynette,* this court stated that "a conspiracy to commit murder can
only be a conspiracy to commit murder of the first degree for the
obvious reason that the agreement to murder necessarily involves the
'willful, deliberate and premeditated' intention to kill a human being."
*(Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 745.) *Kynette* thus expresses the
view that conspiracy to commit murder, as an agreement to commit the
elements of first degree murder, requires proof that the conspirators'
intent to kill was deliberate and premeditated, but assumes that the
agreement to murder itself will provide proof of deliberation and
premeditation.

According to Justice Mosk, however, conspiracy to murder requires no
mental state other than intent to kill. He states that "\[t\]he offense
does not require, as a factual matter, a *premeditated and deliberate*
intent to kill." (Conc. opn. of Mosk, J., *ante,* at p. 613, italics in
original.) In effect, Justice Mosk treats all conspiracies to commit
murder as conspiracies to commit *second* degree express-malice
murder---that is, the only mental state required, or relevant, to
conspiracy to commit murder, in addition to intent to agree, is intent
to kill, which is the mental state of second degree express-malice
murder.[^120]

For this reason, under Justice Mosk's approach, every murder conspiracy
would be punished as first degree murder even though the jury would have
found only the mental state of second degree murder---intent to kill.
Thus, conspiracy agreements to commit only the elements of second degree
express-malice murder (e.g., agreements that lack premeditation and
deliberation) and conspiracy agreements that reflect the premeditation
and deliberation that distinguishes first degree murder would both be
subject to the punishment established for first degree murder. As I have
noted, this would produce the unjust and illogical result that second
degree express-malice murder conspiracies would be punished more
severely than the completed crime of second degree murder.

Furthermore, Justice Mosk's position is contrary to the ordinary meaning
of section 182. In justification, he suggests that to follow section
182's plain language, under which murder conspiracies are subject to the
punishment for first degree murder if the trier of fact fails to
determine the degree of the murder that is the conspiracy's object,
would violate the general rule that when the trier of fact fails to
determine the degree of the felony that is the object of a conspiracy,
or the degree of a substantive felony, the defendant is only subject to
the punishment prescribed for the lesser degree. (See Pen. Code, §§ 182,
1157, 1192.) There is, however, a logical reason why, when the trier of
fact fails to determine the degree of the crime, murder conspiracies are
punished in the first degree while conspiracies to commit all other
crimes are punished in the lesser degree. Deliberate and premeditated
murders are murders of the first degree. As *Kynette* recognized, in the
typical murder conspiracy the conspirators will act with premeditation
and deliberation in forming an agreement to commit the crime. *(Kynette,
supra,* 15 Cal.2d at p. 745.) Punishing murder conspiracies of
unspecified degree as first degree murder conspiracies simply accords
with the statistical reality that the vast majority of murder
conspiracies will involve premeditation and deliberation.

The deliberate and premeditated nature of most conspiracies, however,
does not similarly increase the likelihood that conspiracies to commit
crimes other than murder will be first degree conspiracies. Unlike
murder, other crimes of degree do not become first degree by being
premeditated and deliberate; as to those crimes, the degree of the crime
typically turns on the nature of the defendant's acts rather than the
defendant's mental state. For example, the degree of a robbery can vary
depending on the location where the robbery occurs. (Pen. Code, §
212.5.) Thus, the fact that conspiracies to commit crimes other than
murder may also reflect a premeditated and deliberate intent to commit
the underlying crime does not support a similar "presumption" that the
crime, if committed, would be in the first degree.

Justice Mosk also asserts that following the plain meaning of section
182 and recognizing the existence of both first and second degree murder
conspiracies would mean that the Legislature, in enacting section 182 in
1955, intended to subject to the possibility of the death penalty anyone
convicted of conspiracy to murder merely because the jury failed to
specify the degree of the crime. His reading of section 182, however,
under which all conspiracies to commit murder are punished the same as
first degree murders and his view that conspiracy to commit murder is a
unitary crime requiring only intent to kill leads to an even more
extreme result, namely, that the Legislature intended to subject *all*
murder conspirators to the death penalty even if they lacked the intent
to commit the elements of first degree murder (e.g., premeditation and
deliberation).

Finally, Justice Mosk notes that reading section 182 as dividing
conspiracy to murder into degrees would mean that the Legislature
implicitly rejected *Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, in adopting section
182. In my view, however, there is nothing so unreasonable about this
conclusion that would justify this court, in order to avoid it, to
depart from the ordinary meaning of the language used in that statute.

In my view, the *post-Kynette, supra,* 15 Cal.2d 731, punishment
language of section 182, the decision in *Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290,
and the Legislature's acceptance of *Horn* foreclose the result that
Justice Mosk proposes. Instead, I would continue to adhere to *Horn\'s*
recognition that, under section 182, conspiracy to commit first degree
murder (subject to the punishment prescribed for first degree murder)
and conspiracy to commit second degree murder (subject to the punishment
prescribed for second degree murder) are both possible crimes.

IV

I now turn to the question of the degree or degrees of conspiracy to
murder for which these defendants may be retried, and what punishment
they may receive if convicted. The scope of retrial and resentencing
turns on the effect, if any, of two constitutional limitations: the
prohibition against double jeopardy *(Montana* v. *Hall* (1987) 481 U.S.
400, 402 \[95 L.Ed.2d 354, 358-359, 107 S.Ct. 1825\]; *People* v.
*Santamaría* (1994) 8 Cal.4th 903, 910-911 \[35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884
P.2d 81\]) and the due process bar against retroactive increases in
punishment (see *People* v. *Escobar* (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 752 \[12
Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 837 P.2d 1100\]; *Bouie* v. *City of Columbia* (1964)
378 U.S. 347, 352-354 \[12 L.Ed.2d 894, 899-900, 84 S.Ct. 1697\]).

In convicting defendants of conspiracy, the jury completed two verdict
forms with respect to each defendant. First, it completed a form
entitled "Verdict" and reading, "We, the jury in the above-entitled
cause, find the defendant \[name\]\_of the crime of felony, to wit:
violation of Section 182.1 of the California Penal Code (Conspiracy)" by
filling in the blank with the word "Guilty." Second, it completed a form
entitled "Finding on Object of Conspiracy" and reading, "We, the jury in
the above-entitled cause, having found the defendant, \[name\] Guilty of
conspiracy, find that defendant conspired to commit the crimes opposite
the designation of which there has been placed an 'X'." There then
follows a list of five crimes: first degree murder, second degree
murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and auto
theft. The jury put an "X" next to second degree murder. Swain was also
found not guilty of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary
manslaughter (but guilty of intimidating a witness); Chat-man was also
found guilty of second degree murder.

Defendant Swain, arguing that the only murder conspiracy crime existing
now is conspiracy to commit first degree murder, contends that he cannot
be retried because he was impliedly acquitted of conspiracy to commit
first degree murder when the jury checked off only second degree murder
as the object of the conspiracy. As I conclude that conspiracy to commit
second degree express-malice murder is a possible crime, I reject this
contention. Defendant Chatman, arguing that both first and second degree
murder conspiracies are possible, apparently concedes that he can be
retried for conspiracy to commit second degree murder but not conspiracy
to commit first degree murder. The Attorney General, taking the position
that the only crime at issue is conspiracy in the abstract, contends
that the defendants were convicted of the only crime they were charged
with ("conspiracy") and were acquitted of nothing. The Attorney General
contends that if their convictions are reversed, there are no limits on
the crimes defendants can be charged with on retrial.

The Attorney General's position lacks merit. It would for example,
permit retrial not only of the full range of murder conspiracies that
exist under the law (whether that is ultimately determined to be first
and second degree murder, first degree murder, or simply "murder") but
also conspiracy to commit auto theft, one of the other options given to,
but not chosen by, the jury that convicted defendants. Moreover, in
*Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d at page 298, we rejected the view that
conspiracy is a crime that exists in the abstract without reference to
the crime that is the object of the conspiracy.

Rather, in accordance with my view that we should adhere to *Horn's,
supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, division of conspiracy to murder into conspiracy
to commit first degree murder and conspiracy to commit second degree
express-malice murder, these defendants may be retried for conspiracy to
commit second degree murder, the crime for which these defendants were
convicted. Doing so will not violate the double jeopardy clause, for
these defendants were convicted, not acquitted, of conspiracy to commit
second degree murder, the crime for which they would be retried.
*(Montana* v. *Hall, supra,* 481 U.S. at p. 402 \[95 L.Ed.2d at pp.
358-359\]; *People* v. *Santamaria, supra,* 8 Cal.4th at pp. 910-911.)
If they are again convicted, there is no legal obstacle to the trial
court again sentencing defendants to the punishment for second degree
murder that they received before, as there would be no retroactive
increase in the punishment to which they were previously subject. The
protection against double jeopardy does preclude retrying these
defendants for conspiracy to commit first degree murder, a crime of
which they were impliedly acquitted. (See *People* v. *Superior Court*
(Marks) (1991) 1 Cal.4th 56, 71, 74-76 \[2 Cal.Rptr.2d 389, 820 P.2d
613\]; *Stone* v. *Superior Court* (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 511 & fn. 5
\[183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809\].)

Notes and Questions (People v. Swain)

 

1\. Inchoate crimes (solicitation, conspiracy and attempt) involve a
dual intent: first, an intent to solicit/conspire/perform an overt act
towards the commission of a crime and second, an intent to achieve the
object crime. Suppose *A* is a US Marine who has gone rogue and is
attempting to provide insider military information to *M,* whom he
believes is a Soviet intelligence officer. In reality, *M* is an FBI
agent. Can *A* be convicted of attempted conspiracy to commit espionage?
The answer depends on whether the court adopts a unilateral or bilateral
theory of conspiracy. For a discussion on the matter, see [*United
States v. Anzalone*, 43 M.J. 322 (C.A.A.F.
1995)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I99b1f52cb13511d991d0cc6b54f12d4d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(oc.Default)).

 

2\. *L* and *M* witness their brother *N* get killed by *O.* L and M
flee but, adequately provoked and in a heat of passion, vow to concoct a
plan to kill O together. Have they conspired to commit murder or
conspired to commit voluntary manslaughter? Apply the MPC.

 

3\. *A* and *B* believe that arsenic is the secret compound to making
delicious brownies. Even though they don't want to kill anyone, they,
quite literally, believe these brownies are to die for. They are aware
that people will die if they ingest arsenic in small quantities. If they
bake brownies using arsenic and sell them to customers who eat them and
die, what type of homicide have *A* and *B* committed under the MPC? Is
it attempted murder if they bake and sell the brownies, and their
customers who eat them miraculously survive? Can they be convicted of
conspiracy to commit murder?

See Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 5.03 cmt. 2(c)(1), at 407--08
(1985).

 

4\. X says to Y, "You should buy some of the research chemical 2-CX. I
bet you'd like using it and you can sell some to your friends, too!"

Y reads about its effects and says, "Sounds like I'd love it! I'll buy
some to use and sell."

X helps Y look on the dark web and Y makes the purchase of a quantity
sufficient to impute intent to distribute.

Suppose buying and selling 2-CX is illegal. If X and Y know that buying
and selling 2-CX is illegal, their actions can constitute a conspiracy
to commit these crimes.

But what if 2-CX was a long-time legal drug and neither X nor Y knew of
its recent change in status to a scheduled drug, making it a strict
liability offense to possess with the intent to distribute. If Y
purchases the drug in a sufficient quantity, she would be guilty of
possession of 2-CX with the intent to distribute. But, given these
facts, can we say that X and Y are guilty of *conspiring* to possess
2-CX with the intent to distribute? Must they have actual knowledge of
the attendant circumstance of the drug's illegal status to be guilty of
*conspiring* to illegally sell it? In other words, can they argue that
they can't be guilty of conspiring to commit this act (possessing 2-CX
with the intent to distribute) without knowing the act was illegal?
Argue first as a prosecutor attempting to convict X and Y. Then argue as
a defense attorney trying to protect them.

 

Courts are split on the issue of whether a conspiracy can be proven if
the parties have do not have knowledge of the attendant circumstance.
Some courts require a higher *mens rea* regarding the attendant
circumstance to prove conspiracy as opposed to its target offense. In
our example, this would mean that X and Y cannot be convicted of
conspiring to possess 2-CX with the intent to distribute unless they
knew it was illegal. In other courts, the *mens rea* to commit
conspiracy is the same *mens rea* required for its target offense. In
our example, this would mean that since X and Y intended to possess 2-CX
with the intent to distribute it, they also intended to conspire to do
so.   

 

The Model Penal Code says:

The conspiracy provision in the Code does not attempt to solve the
problem by explicit formulation \[...\] \[I\]t was believed that the
matter is best left to judicial resolution as cases that present the
question may arise, and that the formulations proposed afford sufficient
flexibility for satisfactory decision. Under Subsection (1) of Section
5.03 it is enough that the object of the agreement is "conduct that
constitutes the crime," which can be held to import no more than the
mental state required for the substantive offense into the agreement to
commit it. Although the agreement must be made "with the purpose of
promoting or facilitating the commission of the crime," it is arguable,
though by no means certain, that such a purpose may be proved although
the actor did not know of the existence of a circumstance, which did
exist in fact, when knowledge of the circumstance is not required for
the substantive offense. Rather than press the matter further in this
section, the Institute deliberately left the matter to interpretation in
the context in which the issue is presented.

Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 5.03 cmt. 2(c)(ii), at 413--14
(1985).

 

5\. In the prior note, we discussed a situation where the actors lacked
the factual knowledge that their their behavior was illegal (that 2-CX
was a scheduled drug). What if the parties are aware and in agreement of
all facts but don't know that their actions constitute a crime? Suppose,
for example, that *B*, a businessman from country *N* where it is common
to give gifts to seal a business deal, gives *G,* a government official
in another country*,* an expensive bottle of wine before the closing of
their international trade deal. Neither of them know that this violates
the bribery laws in country *N.* Under *Swain,* can they be found guilty
of conspiring to violate the bribery law?

Some jurisdictions utilize what is called the "corrupt motive doctrine,"
which says that in addition to the normal *mens rea* requirement,
alleged conspirators must also have a corrupt or immoral motive to be
guilty of a conspiracy. Do you find this rule to be at odds with the
idea that "ignorance of the law is no excuse"?

People v. Barajas

 

Michigan Court of Appeals

198 Mich. App. 551

Docket No. 124795

1993-03-02

**\[ ... \]**

Per Curiam.

Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of conspiracy to
possess over 650 grams of cocaine. MCL 750.157a(a); MSA 28.354(1) (a)
and MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7403)(2)(a) (i). He was sentenced
to life in prison without parole. He now appeals, and we reverse.

Defendant's conviction arises out of a complicated drug deal. Briefly,
defendant was to purchase approximately one kilogram of cocaine from
Rene Vina. However, before the purchase was completed, one of Vina's
employees, Richard Kellogg, began cooperating with the police.
Apparently, Vina intended to make two sales on this particular occasion:
one to defendant and one to a purchaser to be arranged by Kellogg.
Unfortunately for Vina, Kellogg set up the sale with an undercover
police officer.

Defendant was arrested, however, before the sale was completed. A search
of Vina's motel room revealed a package intended for delivery to
defendant. That package contained over one kilogram of baking soda and a
rock of cocaine weighing 26.01 grams. The rock was taped to the inside
of the box and the box had a V-style slit in it exposing the rock.
Apparently, the purpose of the slit was to allow inspection of the
contents by the purchaser (defendant) and was placed so that defendant
would test the rock of cocaine and not the baking soda. One of the
police officers involved expressed the opinion that Vina was endeavoring
to \"burn" defendant by delivering a smaller quantity of drugs than for
which he had contracted.

Thus, although defendant never possessed the drugs in question, the
prosecutor theorized that defendant had reached an agreement with Vina
to possess the drugs. Accordingly, the prosecutor charged defendant with
conspiracy.

Defendant's first argument is dispositive. Defendant argues that there
was insufficient evidence to establish the conspiracy. We agree. **\[
... \]**

A conspiracy is an agreement, expressed or implied, between two or more
persons to commit an unlawful or criminal act. **\[ ... \]**Thus, to
establish that defendant and Vina conspired in the case at bar, the
prosecutor had to show, inter alia, that defendant and Vina had agreed
that defendant would commit the crime of possession of more than 650
grams of cocaine. That is, the prosecutor had to establish that both
defendant and Vina intended defendant to possess the requisite amount of
cocaine.

*\[A long discussion about the meaning of the word \"mixture\" and
whether a single rock of cocaine surrounded by a kilo of baking soda is
a mixture of cocaine.\]*

For the above reasons, we conclude that the package did not contain a
mixture of cocaine weighing over 650 grams. Therefore, the package does
not establish an agreement by Vina and defendant for defendant to
possess over 650 grams of cocaine. A conspiracy could also, however, be
established if it can be shown that Vina did agree to deliver over 650
grams of cocaine to defendant and only thereafter decided to \"burn"
defendant by delivering less. However, a conspiracy requires that \"two
or more persons intend to agree *and* intend that the object of their
agreement be achieved." Dressier, *supra,* § 29.05\[A\], p 384 (emphasis
in original). Professor Dressier further explains this concept:

> Justice Cardozo said that \"\[i\]t is impossible . . . for a man to
> conspire with himself." This comment follows from the fact that a
> conspiracy is an agreement and an agreement is a group act. Unless at
> least two people form an agreement no one does. The result is that at
> common law the prosecutor must prove that at least two persons
> possessed the requisite *mens rea* of a conspiracy.
>
> The plurality rule also prevents the conviction of a party to a
> two-person agreement if it is demonstrated that one person lacked the
> specific intent of conspiracy. *If one party to the alleged conspiracy
> feigned the intent to commit or to participate in the offense* (e.g.,
> she was a police officer) or was insane and lacked the requisite
> intent, *the remaining party cannot be convicted. \[Id.,* §
> 29.06\[A\], p 389, quoting *Morrison v California,* 291 US 82, 92; 54
> S Ct 281; 78 L Ed 664 (1934) (emphasis added).\]

Thus, if Vina had originally intended, at the time of making the
agreement with defendant, to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine, then
there was a conspiracy even if Vina later abandoned that plan in favor
of defrauding defendant. However, if Vina always intended to defraud
defendant and merely told defendant he would deliver a kilogram of
cocaine, knowing he had no such intention and was going to defraud
defendant, then Vina merely feigned his intent to participate in the
crime of possession of over 650 grams of cocaine. In such case, there
was no conspiracy to possess over 650 grams of cocaine because Vina knew
at the time of making the agreement with defendant that he would not be
participating in such an offense.

However, we have found no evidence, nor has the prosecutor pointed us to
such evidence, from which the trier of fact could conclude that Vina
decided to defraud defendant only after entering into the conspiracy. As
far as the record establishes, Vina may well have intended all along to
defraud defendant and, therefore, there never was a conspiracy.

Although it may be that defendant is guilty of attempted possession of
over 650 grams of cocaine, there was insufficient evidence to establish
defendant's guilt of the crime of conspiracy. Our resolution of this
issue renders it unnecessary to consider defendant's remaining issues.

Defendant's conviction is vacated and defendant is ordered discharged
from custody.

Commonwealth v. Costa

 

Massachusetts Appeals Court

55 Mass. App. Ct. 901

No. 99-P-942

2002-06-10

A District Court jury found the defendant guilty of conspiring to
destroy property and the malicious destruction of property having a
value of less than \$250.[^121] **\[ ... \]** On appeal, the defendant
confines himself to the conspiracy conviction and argues that the judge
erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty and in
requiring him to make restitution in an amount that exceeded the jury's
finding on the substantive offense. Concluding that the Commonwealth
failed to prove an essential element of the crime of conspiracy, an
agreement, we reverse the judgment.

1\. *The Commonwealth's evidence.* Throughout the night of June 23,
1997, the defendant and his friends, Richard Williams, Greg Barraloni
(Williams's roommate), and Corey Mulansen, patronized various bars in
the Fitchburg-Worcester area. As they were driving through Phillipston,
they passed The Cycle Design, a motorcycle shop from which Barraloni had
been ejected about two to three months earlier because of a dispute with
"Doug," the owner. Upon seeing the shop, Barraloni cried out, "Let's get
back at Doug," and ordered Williams, who was driving, to stop the car.
Williams pulled over, and Barraloni got out of the car, saying words to
the effect of "let's smash some windows." After Barraloni got out of the
car, Williams started to drive away with the defendant and Mulansen, who
had passed out from alcohol consumption. Williams drove about one
hundred yards up the road, pulled over, and parked his car. He and the
defendant then walked back to the shop. There they saw that the windows
in the building had been smashed with rocks. While attempting to
convince Barraloni to leave, Williams and the defendant threw rocks at
the shop. Within minutes, the police arrived, and everyone fled. When
the defendant was later arrested, he stated that he had thrown one or
two rocks at, but not into, the building.

2\. *Discussion.* "The elements of conspiracy are 'a combination of two
or more persons, by some concerted action, to accomplish some criminal
or unlawful purpose \.... \[T\]he unlawful agreement constitutes the
gist of the offence \....'" **\[ ... \]**

It is the Commonwealth's argument that the jury reasonably could infer
an agreement from the evidence showing that the defendant heard
Barraloni's statement, "Let's get back at Doug," that he returned to the
shop after Williams parked the car, that he threw rocks at the building,
and that he fled upon the arrival of the police. See *Commonwealth* v.
*Stasiun,* 349 Mass. 38, 50 (1965) ("conspiracy may be, and usually is,
proved by circumstantial evidence")**\[ ... \]**. The defendant, on the
other hand, argues that, even if that evidence, taken in the light most
favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to show his participation
in a joint venture, it failed to establish that he had conspired
maliciously to destroy property. See *Commonwealth* v. *Cook,* 10 Mass.
App. Ct. 668, 673 (1980) (" \[accomplice and conspiratorial liability
are not synonymous, and one can be an accomplice aiding in the
commission of a substantive offense without necessarily conspiring to
commit it"); *Commonwealth* v. *DeCillis,* 41 Mass. App. Ct. 312, 314
(1996) (the "agreement that must be shown to prove a conspiracy is a
meeting of the minds of the conspirators separate and distinct from and
prior to the common intent that is implicit in the commission of the
substantive crime").

The circumstances of the commission of the substantive offense were not
such that the jury reasonably could infer the existence of an agreement.
Instead, they evince spontaneity rather than "planning and pursuit of a
prearranged systematic course of action." **\[ ... \]**. Nor can an
agreement reasonably be inferred from the fact that the defendant walked
back to the shop and joined Barraloni. That conduct does no more than
"fit\[\] the classic paradigm of an accomplice adding encouragement to a
crime in progress."

**\[ ... \]**. Although the defendant's flight from the scene bespeaks a
consciousness of guilt as a participant in the rock throwing, it adds
nothing to the Commonwealth's case on the conspiracy complaint. In
short, the Commonwealth asks that we conclude that an agreement could be
inferred from the evidence of the defendant's participation in the
commission of the substantive offense. On the circumstances presented,
such a conclusion "would confuse certain settled aspects of the law of
conspiracy and would tend unnecessarily to expand its already elastic
and pervasive definition by 'blur\[ring\] the demarcation line between a
conspiracy to commit an offense and the substantive offense which is the
object of the conspiracy.' **\[ ... \]**

The judgment on the third count of the complaint is reversed, the
verdict is set aside, and judgment is to be entered for the defendant on
that count.

*So ordered.*

Nos. 2542 and 2543

**\[ ... \]**

PER CURIAM:

Appellant Charles Azim appeals *nunc pro tunc* from judgments of
sentence imposed for criminal conspiracy and robbery. **\[ ... \]**

Appellant was arrested, along with Mylice James and Thomas Robinson, on
September 18, 1977 for simple assault, robbery, and conspiracy. The
victim of the robbery was Jerry Tennenbaum, a Temple University student.
Appellant drove a car in which the other two men were passengers.
Appellant stopped the car, Robinson called Tennenbaum over to the curb,
the two passengers got out of the car, inflicted bodily injury on
Tennenbaum, took his wallet which had fallen to the ground, and
immediately left the scene in the same car driven by appellant. Robinson
and appellant were tried to a jury and convicted as co-defendants in
April 1978. **\[ ... \]**

In this appeal, appellant presents two issues: (1) that he was convicted
upon insufficient evidence; and (2) that his trial counsel was
ineffective in the course of the trial.[^122] The claim of insufficiency
of the evidence relates to the charge of criminal conspiracy. He argues
that because his conspiracy conviction was not supported by sufficient
evidence against him, the charges of assault and robbery must also fail.

**\[ ... \]** In *Commonwealth v. Volk,* 298 Pa.Super. 294, 444 A.2d
1182 (1982) (also reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a
conspiracy charge) our Court maintained that the test to be applied in
appraising the sufficiency of the evidence is a two-step inquiry:

> First, we must regard all the evidence in the light most favorable to
> the Commonwealth, accepting as true all evidence upon which the fact

At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that established that
appellant was the driver of the car in which James and Robinson (the men
who demanded money from Tennenbaum and beat and choked him) rode.
Robinson was seated on the front seat, next to appellant. Robinson
rolled down the car window, twice beckoned to the victim to come close
to the car, and when Tennenbaum refused, the two passengers got out,
assaulted Tennenbaum, and took his wallet. Appellant sat at the wheel,
with the engine running and lights on, and the car doors open, while the
acts were committed in the vicinity of the car. He then drove James and
Robinson from the scene (Suppression Hearing T. 77-88; N.T. 4-8).

Among those circumstances relevant to proving conspiracy are association
with alleged conspirators, knowledge of the commission of the crime,
presence at the scene of the crime, and, at times, participation in the
object of the conspiracy. *Commonwealth v. Anderson, supra.* Conspiracy
to commit burglary has been found where the defendant drove codefendants
to the scene of a crime and then later picked them up. *Commonwealth v.
Wright,* 235 Pa.Super. 601, 344 A.2d 512 (1975). "Thus, the driver of a
'get away' car can be found guilty as an accomplice if it is reasonable
to infer that he was aware of the actual perpetrator's intention. His
agreement to effectuate the escape aids the perpetrator in the planning
and commission of the actual crime" *(Wright,* at 515). *Commonwealth v.
Esposito,* 236 Pa.Super. 127, 344 A.2d 655 (1975) upheld the conviction
for conspiracy of the driver of a get away car. We find no merit in
appellant's claim that he was merely a hired driver, with no knowledge
of his passengers' criminal activity.

We hold that a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that appellant conspired with James and Robinson to commit
assault and robbery. Applying the test mandated by *Volk, supra,* we
decline to dismiss appellant's conviction for criminal conspiracy on the
basis of insufficiency of the evidence.

Once conspiracy is established and upheld, a member of the conspiracy is
also guilty of the criminal acts of his co-conspirators, even if he is
not present at the time the acts are committed. *Commonwealth v. Roux,*
465 Pa. 482, 350 A.2d 867 (1976), *Commonwealth v. Tumminello,* 292
Pa.Super. 381, 437 A.2d 435 (1981). In the instant case, co-conspirator
Robinson's direct appeal resulted in the grant of a new trial on the
assault and robbery charges, and we agree with the trial court that it
is appropriate for appellant to be afforded the same relief. We
therefore find it unnecessary to reach appellant's additional charges on
his trial counsel's ineffectiveness.

Judgment of sentence is vacated. The case is remanded for a new trial on
the charges of assault and robbery, and for resentencing on the
conviction for conspiracy, following the outcome of the new trial.
Jurisdiction is relinquished.

Notes and Questions (Com. v. Costa)

 

1.     Does the court's reasoning in *Costa* contradict that of the
*Azim* court?

2.     The *Costa* court reasons that although there was enough evidence
to show that the defendant participated in the crime of malicious
destruction of property having a value of less than \$250 (as an
accomplice), there was insufficient evidence to prove that he conspired
to do so. Conversely in *Pinkerton,* although Daniel Pinkerton and his
brother Walter conspired to commit tax fraud together, Daniel was not an
accomplice to Walter's commission of the substantive counts.

Is it possible for someone to be an accomplice in the crime of
conspiracy, without being a co-conspirator in the substantive offense?
If so, present a fact pattern that demonstrates this scenario.

If a "conspiracy" consists of the people who are working toward a
proscribed object, and if one who aids and abets a substantive offense
becomes liable as a principal thereto, then it follows that one who aids
and abets these men in the attainment of their object becomes liable as
a conspirator. \[...\] \[T\]his reasoning from a faulty premise \[...\]
\[is\] difficult to discover since it is assumed rather than articulated
\[...\]. But to aid and abet a crime it is necessary not merely to help
the criminal, but to help him in the commission of the particular
criminal offense. A person does not aid and abet a conspiracy by helping
the "conspiracy" to commit a substantive offense, for the crime of
conspiracy is separate from the offense which is its object. It is
necessary to help the "conspiracy" in the commission of the crime of
conspiracy, that is, in the commission of the act of agreement. Only
then is it justifiable to dispense with the necessity of proving
commission of the act of agreement by the defendant himself.

166 Cal. App. 2d 410, 333 P.2d 243 (1958)

SHEPARD, Justice.

Defendants were charged with others by indictment with the crime of
conspiracy 'to cheat and defraud by criminal means, and to obtain money
and property by false pretenses and by false promises with intent not to
perform such promises, in violation of [section
182](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000298&cite=CAPES182&originatingDoc=I9d0a8e02facb11d98ac8f235252e36df&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Search)),

\* \*'.

**\[ ... \]**

 

 

A review of the evidence shows that defendants Moran and Zarcone started
a usedcar business in San Diego in the fall of 1956**\[ ... \]**. To
outward appearance this was a legitimate business.

However, the evidence shows that by a systematic use of false
advertising, with full knowledge of its falsity and intent to use it
falsely, they induced customers to come to the used-car lot with the
idea that they could purchase a car with a \$5 down payment. **\[ ...
\]**

The evidence further shows that once in the clutches of the salesman the
prospective buyer was systematically and intentionally fed false and
misleading information, both of existing facts and of intended future
conduct by the firm which the salesman knew was never intended to be
performed. This consisted of many different types of representation,
including what could or would be done in refinancing, as to what amounts
cars would be sold for, and by obtaining customers\' signatures on blank
contracts and later filling in amounts far different than those orally
discussed. **\[ ... \]**

George Vogel, a baker, saw the advertisement, responded, located a car
on the lot marked \$495, had the price confirmed by a salesman, and was
transferred to the tender ministrations of Jackson. **\[ ... \]** Vogel
examined his purchase order and discovered that the car he originally
thought he was buying for \$495 had been sold to him at the price of
\$1,385, and instead of \$30 a month his total payments, including the
payments on the \$400 he had borrowed, were \$53.87.

Manuel Anthony Zaragoza, a Navy truck driver, saw the '\$5 down' signs,
came to the lot, met a salesman, told him he could pay only \$70 per
month, selected a car at a purchase price of \$2,195, and Jackson was
introduced as credit manager. **\[ ... \]**Zaragoza\'s total monthly
payments ended up at \$103 per month, counting the payments to the loan
company.

**\[ ... \]**with dozens of this kind of transactions occurring over a
period of a few weeks and with the pattern similar in each of them; with
these defendants working together on the same lot with an agreement
between them to split their commissions, plus other evidence from within
the organization itself in which the whole plan of operation was loosely
outlined by glib instructions on how to lie and what steps to take to
enmesh a customer; with conferences going on back and forth on purchases
of this kind; with this kind of a pattern between these defendants and
the owners and other salesmen on the lot, it was not unreasonable for
the trier of fact to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that those
within the organization were conspiring together to cheat and defraud in
the manner described in the indictment. **\[ ... \]**

criminal conspiracy is an agreement to commit any crime or do any other
act denounced by the statute. The gist of the offense is the unlawful
agreement between the conspirators to do an act contrary to law,
accompanied by an overt act to at least start to carry the conspiracy
into effect. [**\[ ...
\]**](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000298&cite=CAPES182&originatingDoc=I9d0a8e02facb11d98ac8f235252e36df&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Search))

**\[ ... \]** It is not necessary to prove that the parties entered into
a concrete written agreement or even that all the parties gathered
together at one time for a mutual and immediate discussion and
agreement. It can happen that the agreement be arrived at in piecemeal
fashion. It is sufficient if by either direct or circumstantial
evidence, or both, the trier of fact is convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the unlawful agreement did, in fact, come into existence and
that while it was still in existence an overt act pursuant to the
unlawful conspiracy purpose was committed. **\[ ... \]**

'As a general rule, a conspiracy can only be established by
circumstantial evidence 'for, as the courts have said, it is not often
that the direct fact of an unlawful design which is the essence of a
conspiracy can be proved otherwise than by the establishment of
independent facts, bearing more or less closely or remotely upon the
common design (5 Cal.Jur. 521); **\[ ... \]**

Jackson contends he only came in after the commencement of the
conspiracy and that, therefore, he was only guilty of independent
unlawful acts. The evidence sufficiently supports the implied finding of
the court that Jackson did act with other members of the conspiracy in
furtherance of its purposes and with knowledge of the existence of the
conspiracy. Where a conspiracy has already been formed and at a later
date a stranger to the original conspiracy associates himself with the
conspirators, and with knowledge of the conspiracy joins with the others
in committing overt acts in furtherance of the unlawful purpose, he is
guilty as a member of the conspiracy.

'It is of course true that mere association with the perpetrator of a
crime is not sufficient to prove a criminal conspiracy.**\[ ... \]** An
entirely different situation may arise, however, when it is shown that a
conspiracy is already in existence and that acts are being committed in
furtherance thereof.' [**\[ ...

Jackson also contends that he withdrew from the conspiracy and therefore
should be exculpated from responsibility therefor. **\[ ... \]**There
was no conclusive proof that Jackson ever withdrew from the conspiracy
at any time but, even if he had withdrawn, he had already committed acts
from which the jury were entitled to conclude that he was actively
participating in the conspiracy with knowledge of its purposes.

effectively withdraw therefrom by some affirmative act bringing home the
fact of his withdrawal to his confederates. 'Some affirmative act
bringing home the withdrawal to the knowledge of his confederates is
necessary, otherwise the conspiracy once established will be presumed to
continue until the ends are accomplished or its abandonment
established.' **\[ ... \]**

Notes and Questions (People v Moran)

 

1.  MPC. A and B conspire to commit identity theft by falsely collecting
    social security numbers. They plan to make fraudulent calls posing
    as the IRS. B is to make the calls and A will use the collected
    information. Use Model Penal Code §5.03 to determine if B has
    renounced and therefore has a defense.

 

1.  When B makes his first call, he drops and breaks his cell phone. B
    has no other way to make the calls. The calls never get made.

2.  After B breaks his phone he takes it in for repair so he can hold up
    his part of the deal. The repair shop can not fix his phone. The
    calls never get made. 

3.  B takes his phone to another shop. They tell him they'll have it
    ready in two days. In the meantime, the authorities discover A and
    B's plan. B is on his way to pick up the phone when he is arrested. 

4.  B finds out the authorities know of his plot. Before being arrested
    B admits the plot and helps the police locate A.

2\. *Is* *Conspiracy Fair? *\"It is not necessary, in fact, that all the
parties ever have direct contact with one another, or know one
another\'s identity, or even communicate verbally their intention to
agree.\" [Developments in the Law---Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv. L.

Does this seem fair? What theory of punishment does conspiracy
perpetuate?

 

3\. Withdrawing from Conspiracy. In Moran, defendant Jackson claimed he
withdrew from the conspiracy. The court found that Jackson had already
"committed acts from which the jury were entitled to conclude that he
was actively participating in the conspiracy with knowledge of its
purposes." Withdrawal requires an "affirmative act."

State v. Honken

 

25 Neb. App. 352 (2017)

 

Inbody, Pirtle, and Riedmann, Judges.

##  

Riedmann, Judge.

INTRODUCTION

Following a stipulated bench trial, Robert S. Honken was found guilty of
two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree \*355 murder. The
district court for Hamilton County sentenced him to 45 to 50 years'
imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Honken now
appeals his convictions and sentences. Following our review of the
record, we affirm.

BACKGROUND

This case arises out of Honken's attempt to hire two different men to
kill his wife. The parties agreed upon the following stipulated facts,
which were submitted at trial:

On January 16, 2016, Honken contacted Derrick Shirley via text message
regarding a construction job. Honken and Shirley met at Honken's
residence on January 18. After meeting, Honken asked Shirley if he would
kill Honken's wife. The parties entered into an agreement wherein
Shirley would kill Honken's wife in exchange for monetary compensation.

Honken and Shirley communicated primarily through text messages.
Following Shirley's subsequent arrest, law enforcement recovered 659
text messages between the parties from Shirley's cell phone. In the
messages, Honken provided a substantial amount of information regarding
his wife, her residence and property, and her daily routine to assist
Shirley in planning her murder. The parties also discussed how the
murder would occur, and Honken requested on several occasions that
Shirley make the incident look like a robbery. **\[ ... \]**

Honken gave Shirley \$400 for the purchase of a firearm to kill his
wife. Shirley asked a friend to purchase the weapon, a .22-caliber
rifle, for him. The rifle was purchased on February 10, 2016, and
Shirley took possession of it. Law enforcement later recovered the rifle
from his residence.

The final message between Honken and Shirley was sent on February 16,
2016. In that message, Honken wrote to Shirley:

\*\*696 "I was just wanting to say thank you for backing down when you
did. I had a short talk and I think it's going to \*356 lead to more
talks and possibly a \[sic\] end to all of this? I have \[a\] friend
that said I have through the duration of the divorce to prove to her
that I want things to work out. I have deleted the messages on my cloud
and phone. Thank you again for backing down and I don't want you to ever
reconsider what I requested of you before. I think it was a God \[sic\]
thing that you stepped back. I would like the .22 when it works out
because I have a friend down in the Harvard area that said he would keep
it so me and the boys can rabbit hunt around his farm! I can't thank you
enough for heading \[sic\] the call and backing down. This and any other
messages will be deleted but I'll keep your contact information in the
event we're able to work things out and de \[sic\] the remodel work.
Thanks again\...."

Shirley later told law enforcement that he did not go through with the
murder of Honken's wife because he "had prayed about it and just did not
have the heart." Shirley had no further communication with Honken after
the final message that Honken sent on February 16, 2016.

On February 24, 2016, Honken left a voice mail for Mario Flores
regarding remodeling work at his home. In his voice mail, Honken
identified himself as "Sam." Flores returned the call the next day, and
the parties agreed to meet at a gas station in Aurora, Nebraska, on
February 26. During the meeting, Honken asked Flores if he knew anyone
"who could help him kill his wife." Flores responded that he did know
people who could help, but that he would not get involved in it himself.

That same day, Flores contacted the Aurora Police Department to report
his contact with "Sam." Flores met with an investigator from the
Nebraska State Patrol, and during the meeting, Flores made a telephone
call to "Sam" that was recorded by law enforcement. During the call,
"Sam" stated multiple times that he wanted his wife to be killed,
discussed the cost of hiring someone to do so, and discussed how
and \*357 when he would like her murder to occur. "Sam" repeatedly
affirmed that he was serious about killing her and identified himself as
"Robert," the owner of a business in Aurora. Honken told Flores that he
had previously paid someone else \$400 to kill his wife but that person
had backed out and taken his money. **\[ ... \]**

Flores told Honken that he did have the name and telephone number of
someone Honken could hire and that this person would contact him in the
next several days. Later that day, Honken texted Flores from a different
telephone number and stated that he "would like the hitman" to contact
him at that number because it was a prepaid cell phone and he intended
to dispose of it when he no longer needed it.

On February 29, 2016, an investigator with the Nebraska State Patrol
made a recorded telephone call to the number Honken provided and posed
as a potential hitman. During the call, Honken identified himself as
both "Rob" and "Sam." Honken advised the investigator that he was in
need of his services. **\[ ... \]**

Several hours later, the investigator placed another call to Honken and
instructed Honken to meet him at a truckstop in Aurora. Honken drove to
the specified location and met with the investigator **\[ ... \]** The
investigator wore a wire during the meeting to record his conversation
with Honken.

Honken told the investigator that he wanted his wife " 'gone' " and that
he would like her to be killed by March 4, 2016. When the investigator
requested "\$3000 up front," Honken said that he would be able to obtain
the money within several days. He provided the investigator with a
photograph of his wife, as well as a map of her residence. **\[ ... \]**

The investigator requested \$500 for expenses. Honken withdrew the funds
from an automated teller machine inside the truckstop and gave them to
the investigator.

Honken was pulled over shortly after departing the truckstop and placed
under arrest. He admitted to law enforcement that he had hired Shirley
and the undercover investigator to kill his wife. Regarding his
agreement with Shirley, Honken stated that Shirley had contacted him
approximately 3 weeks prior because he had gotten "cold feet" and
decided not to go forward with their plan.

In March 2016, the State charged Honken with two counts of conspiracy to
commit first degree murder**\[ ... \]**

At a hearing **\[ ... \]**, Honken argued that he should have been
charged with only one count of conspiracy rather than two. The district
court overruled Honken's motion,**\[ ... \]**

finding that Honken had engaged in two separate conspiracies, and found
him guilty of two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree murder.
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

1213141516Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-202(1) (Reissue 2008) provides:

A person shall be guilty of criminal conspiracy if, with intent to
promote or facilitate the commission of a felony:

\(a\) He agrees with one or more persons that they or one or more of
them shall engage in or solicit the conduct or shall cause or solicit
the result specified by the definition of the offense; and

\(b\) He or another person with whom he conspired commits an overt act
in pursuance of the conspiracy.

The Nebraska Supreme Court has held that the principal element of a
conspiracy is an agreement or understanding between two or more persons
to inflict a wrong against or injury upon another, although an overt act
is also required. See *State v. Henry*, 292 Neb. 834, 875 N.W.2d 374
(2016). Section 28-202(3) states that "\[i\]f a person conspires to
commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long
as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship." A conspiracy is ongoing until
the central purposes of the conspiracy have either failed or been
achieved. *Id*. Indeed, upon proof of participation in a conspiracy, a
conspirator's continuing participation is presumed unless the
conspirator demonstrates affirmative \*362 withdrawal from the
conspiracy. *Id*. Such withdrawal must be effectuated by more than
ceasing, however definitively, to participate in the conspiracy.
See *id*. Rather, a coconspirator must make an affirmative action either
by making a clean break to the authorities or by communicating
abandonment in a manner calculated to reach coconspirators and must not
resume participation in the conspiracy. See *id*.

Honken argues that the district court violated his right against double
jeopardy because his actions constituted one continuous conspiracy with
both men he hired to kill his wife. He claims that he had the same
objective throughout and that the only element that changed was the
addition of a new coconspirator. Honken asserts that the district
court's finding that his original agreement with Shirley had ended was
in error because the central purposes of that conspiracy had neither
failed nor been achieved, and therefore was ongoing.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**In the present case, while the statutory offenses that
Honken was charged with in both counts were identical, the counts
alleged that the offenses occurred over different and distinct time
periods. The amended information charged Honken, in count I, with
conspiracy to commit first degree murder on or about January 16 through
February 16, 2016. Count II charged Honken with the same statutory
offense, but alleged that it occurred on or about February 26 through
29. As charged by the State, a 10-day break separates the first
conspiracy from the second.

**\[ ... \]**

\*367 Honken's reliance on the proposition of law that a conspiracy is
ongoing until its purpose has either failed or been achieved is
misplaced. He ignores the fact that a conspirator may withdraw from a
conspiracy through an affirmative act. We find that Shirley did withdraw
from the conspiracy on or before February 16, 2016, which terminated the
conspiracy with Honken. Honken did not engage in a new agreement with
anyone to kill his wife until 10 days later, at his meeting with Flores.
Shirley's withdrawal and the 10-day break in time between the two
agreements indicate that Honken's subsequent conspiracy was separate and
distinct from the first. This is further supported by the differences
between the parties involved in each agreement, the specific locations
involved, and the overt acts taken in furtherance of the agreements.

Because we determine that the district court correctly found that Honken
engaged in two separate and distinct conspiracies, we find no double
jeopardy violation and no merit to this assignment of error.

Notes and Questions (State v. Honken)

 

**Notes following *Honken*:**

 

1.     Imagine that, instead of Shirley who had backed out, it was
Honken who initially changed his mind about killing his wife, sending a
text to Shirley saying, "I'm getting cold feet and I don't want our plan
to continue." In response, Shirley says, "I already got the gun and I
want her dead too. I'm still in it if you are." After two weeks of
silence, Honken then seeks out the investigator posing as the hitman for
help to kill his wife. Under the ruling in *Honken,* is this one
continuous conspiracy or two? How about under the MPC? *See* MPC § 5.03
(6)-(7).

2.    Suppose a defendant named Nee concocts a plan to commit a school
shooting with another student, Kerns. Before the planned shooting takes
place, Nee goes to the police without Kerns knowledge and informs them
of this planned attack but places the blame exclusively on Kerns,
denying any participation in the plan. The police then arrest Kerns and
stop the attack from taking place. Is the renunciation defense under MPC
§ 5.03(6) available to Nee in this situation? [Commonwealth v. Nee, 458

3.    Is the defense of legal impossibility available to those charged
with a conspiracy? For example, imagine *Y* and *S,* employees of one
company, conspire with *L,* employee of another company, to provide them
trade secrets in exchange for payment. The FBI confronts *L,* who admits
to this relationship. *L* agrees to participate in a sting operation,
where the FBI provides *L* fake documents bearing "confidential" stamps
to give to *Y* and *S.* Can *Y* and *S* be convicted of conspiracy to
commit theft of a trade secret where the documents were fake and did not
actually contain trade secrets? [United States v. Yang, 281 F.3d 534
(6th Cir.
2002)](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=Y&db=0000506&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&serialnum=2002133974&fn=_top&findtype=Y&vr=2.0&wbtoolsId=2002133974&HistoryType=F).

 

In jurisdictions that recognize the defense of legal impossibility for
attempt charges, can you think of an argument against recognizing the
defense in conspiracy cases? Can you think of any arguments in support
of allowing the legal impossibility defense in conspiracy cases?

Accomplice Liability

 

Most of the cases we have studied have involved only one criminal, and
we have considered the culpability only of the principal actor
committing the crime. In reality, however, many crimes implicate
multiple people. Complicity is not actually a crime; rather, it is a
theory of liability whereby a person can be criminally liable as an
accomplice. In aiding a person who commits a crime, an accomplice
becomes personally liable for the other person's crime. Accomplice
liability holds a person, as a result of his own actions, responsible
for someone else's actions. Increasing a person's liability beyond the
scope of his direct actions, however, risks overextending liability.
Courts and legislatures often account for this by adjusting the mens rea
requirement upward. How far should liability extend? To specifically
intended results, to foreseeable results, or to all results that may
occur? As you read these cases, note not only when courts attach
accomplice liability, but also how far that liability extends.

State v. Ward

 

Court of Appeals of Maryland

284 Md. 189

No. 66

1978-12-21

**\[ ... \]**

Orth, J.,

delivered the opinion of the Court.

With the common law of England, **\[ ... \]** came the doctrine of
accessoryship applicable to felonies. **\[ ... \]**

Accompanying the common law doctrine across the Atlantic were certain
highly technical procedural rules, not altogether logical, which had
developed from the distinction between principals and accessories before
the fact. These rules operate to the advantage of the accused and the
detriment of the prosecution, for they "tended to shield accessories
from punishment notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of their criminal
assistance." W. La Fave & A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law § 63, pp.
498-499 **\[ ... \]**

"In the field of felony the common law divided guilty parties into
principals and accessories." Perkins at 643. Principals came to be
classified as in the first degree (perpetrators) or in the second degree
(abettors) and accessories as before the fact (inciters) or after the
fact (criminal protectors).[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xf176ae0690908ddba0000e597659a294db68e27)

A *principal in the first degree* is one who actually commits a crime,
either by his own hand, or by an inanimate agency, or by an innocent
human agent. A *principal in the second degree* is one who is guilty of
felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the
commission thereof in his presence, either actual or constructive. An
*accessory before the fact* is one who is guilty of felony by reason of
having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof,
without having been present either actually or constructively at the
moment of perpetration. An *accessory after the fact* is one who, with
knowledge of the other's guilt, renders assistance to a felon in the
effort to hinder his detection, arrest, trial or punishment. **\[ ...
\]**

At the common law the principal in the second degree may be tried and
convicted prior to the trial of the principal in the first degree, or
even after the latter has been tried and acquitted. **\[ ...
\]**Furthermore, a principal in the second degree may be convicted of a
higher crime or a lower crime than the principal in the first degree.
**\[ ... \]** With respect to accessories, however, the common law took
a different path. An accessory cannot be tried, without his consent,
before the principal**\[ ... \]** **\[ ... \]**

No. 17925

1988-07-22

371 S.E.2d 366

William E. Kiger, Darla A. Greathouse, Parkersburg, for Kevin Dwayne
Hoselton.

Richard M. Richmond, Asst. Pros. Atty., Wood County, Parkersburg, for
the State.

PER CURIAM:

This case is before the Court upon the appeal of Kevin Wayne Hoselton
from his conviction of entering without breaking a vessel, with intent
to commit larceny, pursuant to *W.Va.Code,* 61-3-12 \[1923\].[^123] **\[
... \]**

The accused was charged in a two-count indictment as a principal in the
first degree for either breaking and entering or entering without
breaking a storage unit on a docked barge with intent to commit larceny.
He was eighteen years old at the time, and was with several friends,
each of whom was separately indicted as a principal in the first degree.
The accused was convicted of entering without breaking, as charged in
the indictment.[^124]

The only evidence used to link the accused to the crime was his
voluntary statement.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xb898ec1182322c211038035c56a174411055773) The pertinent answers
given by the accused in his voluntary statement were, as follows:

> Q. Were you with some individuals that broke into the barge?
>
> A. Yes, sir.
>
> Q. Once you got to the barges, what happened?
>
> A. We all walked up on that, and I was standing outside there. Mike,
> he tried to get the big door open, and he couldn't do it.
>
> Q. M\[ \... \] A\[ \... \]?
>
> A. Yes, sir. And I heard a couple of other people back there --- I
> don't know who it was --- trying to get in.
>
> Q. Why couldn't you see them?
>
> A. Because I was standing at the end of the barge there.
>
> Q. Were you keeping a look-out?
>
> A. You could say that. I just didn't want to go down in there.
>
> Q. Do you know who actually gained entry to the barge.
>
> A. No, sir, I'm not sure.
>
> Q. Kevin, did you know at the time that you were down there that you
> all were committing a crime?
>
> A. Yes, I did know that, but---

The items stolen from the storage unit were tools, grease guns, grease
and a battery charger. None of these items, or profits on their resale,
were given to the accused. In both his statement and his trial
testimony, the accused stated that he, standing at one end of the barge,
with an obstructed view of the storage unit, was unaware of his friends'
intent to steal the items until he heard the opening of the storage unit
door. He then walked to the unit and saw his friends handling the goods.
He then returned to the other end of the barge and went to an
automobile, owned and operated by one of his friends, who remained in
the storage facility. His friends returned to the automobile with the
goods. The accused did not assist the others in placing the goods in the
automobile. He was then immediately driven home.

The accused testified that he and his friends frequently trespassed upon
the barge for fishing.

**\[ ... \]**

On appeal, the accused contends that the evidence is insufficient to
support a conviction for entering with intent to commit larceny.
Therefore, the trial judge erred when he denied the accused's motions
for acquittal and new trial.

**\[ ... \]**

The State contends there was sufficient evidence to establish that the
accused was a lookout, therefore, the conviction for breaking and
entering as a principal in the first degree should stand.

A lookout is one who is "by prearrangement, keeping watch to avoid
interception or detection or to provide warning during the perpetration
of the crimes and thereby participating in the offenses charged \..."
**\[ ... \]**

This Court has consistently held that lookouts are aiders and abettors,
principals in the second degree. **\[ ... \]**

Principals in the second degree are punishable \' as principals in the
first degree. *W.Va.Code,* 61-11-6 \[1923\],

An aider and abettor, or principal in the second degree must "in some
sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as
something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek\[s\] by his action
to make it succeed." *State v. Harper,* 179 W.Va. 24, 28, 365 S.E.2d 69,
73 (1987), *quoting* Learned Hand in *U.S. v. Peoni,* 100 F.2d 401, 402
(2nd Cir.1938).

> It is well established that in order for a defendant to be convicted
> as an aider and abettor, and thus a principal in the second degree,
> the prosecution must demonstrate that he or she shared the criminal
> intent of the principal in the first degree, \[citations omitted\] Of
> course we also recognize that the defendant is not required to possess
> the identical intent as the principal in the first degree.

*State v. Harper,* 179 W.Va. 24, 29, 365 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1987).[^125]

Therefore, if the State establishes evidence that an accused acted as a
lookout, it has necessarily established the requisite act and mental
state to support a conviction of aiding and abetting. **\[ ... \]**

In this case, the only evidence that suggested the accused was a lookout
was his response to the investigating officer's questioning: "Q. Were
you a lookout? A. You could say that. I just didn't want to go down
there."

In both his voluntary statement and during his testimony at trial, the
accused stated that he had no prior knowledge of his friends' intentions
to steal anything from the barge. When he heard the door open to the
storage unit and saw his friends removing the goods, the accused left
the barge and returned to the car. The accused never received any of the
stolen property, which was later retrieved by the police from the other
defendants.

**\[ ... \]**

*\[T\]*he accused's response that "\[y\]ou could say" he was a lookout,
standing completely alone, does not establish that the accused was an
aider and abettor by participating in, and wishing to bring about the
entering with intent to commit larceny.

Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the State did not
prove that the accused was a lookout. Therefore, his conviction as a
principal in the first degree is reversed as it failed to prove that the
accused entered the vessel with shared intent to commit larceny.

We therefore reverse and set aside the accused's conviction for entering
without breaking.[**\[ ...

### STATE vs. GEORGE W. MCVAY, JOHN A. GRANT, GEORGE J.

### KELLEY.

### **\[ ... \]**

The Supreme Court of Rhode Island

MARCH 3, 1926.

**\[ ... \]**

BARROWS, J.

**\[ ... \]**Three indictments for manslaughter**\[ ... \]**were brought
against the captain and engineer of the Steamer Mackinac **\[ ...
\]**The steamer carried several hundred passengers from Pawtucket to
Newport via Narragansett Bay. The boiler producing the steam by which
the vessel was propelled, burst near Newport and many lives were lost.
The present indictments are for causing the deaths of three persons
killed by escaping steam after the explosion of the boiler.

**\[ ... \]**

Our present question **\[ ... \]** is:

> "May a defendant be indicted and convicted of being an accessory
> before the fact to the crime of manslaughter arising through criminal
> negligence as set forth in the indictment?"

**\[ ... \]**In the first count the negligence charged is the "wanton
and willful" creation of any steam in 3, boiler known to be worn,
corroded, defective and \`unsafe, as a result whereof an explosion
occurred killing a passenger; the charge against Kelley as accessory is
that "before said felony and manslaughter was committed," . . . he did
at Pawtucket "feloniously and maliciously aid, assist, abet, counsel,
hire, command and procure the said George W. McVay and John A. Grant,
the said felony and manslaughter in manner and form aforesaid to do and
commit". **\[ ... \]**

The State, substantially adopting the definition of manslaughter as
given in Wharton on Homicide, 3rd ed. p. 5, defines it as "The unlawful
killing of another without malice either express or implied". The State
further refers to the charge in the indictment as "involuntary
manslaughter, that is, the killing of another without malice and
unintentionally in negligently doing an act lawful in itself and in the
negligent omission to perform a legal duty". Because the manslaughter
charge is "Without malice and "involuntary" Kelley contends that he can
not be indicted legally as an accessory before the fact. The argument is
that manslaughter being a Sudden and unpremeditated crime inadvertent
and unintentional by its very nature can not be "maliciously" incited
before the crime is committed. Such is the view expressed by
text-writers, decision or dicta, in 1 Hale, P. C. 437, 615, 616;
Hawkins, P. C. Chap. 30, 2, manslaughter; Goff v. Byby, 2 Cro. Eliz. 540
; **\[ ... \]**In most of these citations a charge of murder was under
consideration and the theory was that, after a conviction for
manslaughter was had, there could be no accessory before the fact. Some
of these authorities state broadly that there can be no accessory before
the fact in manslaughter giving the reasons now urged by Kelley.

While everyone must agree that there can be no accessory before the fact
when a killing results from a sudden and unpremeditated blow, we do not
think it can be broadly stated that premeditation is inconsistent with
every charge of manslaughter. Manslaughter may consist, among other
things, of doing an unlawful act resulting in unintentional killing,
such as violation of motor Vehicle laws or administration of drugs to
procure an abortion. **\[ ... \]**Manslaughter is likewise committed if
an unintentional killing is occasioned by gross negligence in the doing
of an act lawful in itself. **\[ ... \]**There is no inherent reason
Why, prior to the commission of such a crime, one may not aid, abet,
counsel, command or procure the doing of the unlawful act or of the
lawful act in a negligent manner. A premeditated act may be involved in
such unlawful homicides. **\[ ... \]**

By keeping these distinctions in mind, the present indictment for
involuntary manslaughter is not self-contradictory when it charges
Kelley to be an accessory before the fact. It was possible for him at
Pawtucket to intentionally direct and counsel the grossly negligent act
which the indictment charges resulted in the crime. Involuntary
manslaughter, as set forth in this indictment means that defendants
exercised no conscious volition to take life but their negligence was of
such a character that criminal intention can be presumed. **\[ ...
\]**The crime was consummated when the explosion occurred. The volition
of the principals was exercised when they chose negligently to create
steam which the boiler could not carry. The doing of the act charged or
failure t6 perform the duty charged was Voluntary and intentional in the
sense that defendants exercised a choice among courses of conduct. It is
obvious that Kelley could participate and is charged with participating
in procuring defendants to act in a grossly negligent manner prior to
the explosion. **\[ ... \]**

Specific duties are stated to have been laid upon the captain and
engineer. Defendant is charged with full knowledge of those duties and
of the fact that the boiler was unsafe. He is charged with counseling
and procuring the principals at Pawtucket to disregard their duties and
negligently create steam. **\[ ... \]**The facts set forth in these
indictments, if existent, are such that a jury might find that defendant
Kelley, with full knowledge of the possible danger to human life,
recklessly and willfully advised, counseled and commanded the captain
and engineer to take a chance by negligent action or failure to act.

Notes on Accomplice Liability and Mens Rea

 

Aiding and abetting is best thought of as a separate route to liability
from the ordinary actus reus committed by the actual perpetrator. At the
same time, statutes governing accomplice liability feature the classic
components of all crimes: an actus reus and a mens rea. That is, to
convict, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
has aided the principal actor, and has done so with the requisite
culpable mental state. However, to make a charge of aiding and abetting,
the actual crime must have been committed (or attempted) by another
party. This can result in surprising outcomes consistent with
blackletter law. Consider the follow hypothetical:

Two men engage in a drive by shooting. The principal perpetrator driving
the car starts a confrontation with a group of men standing on the side
of the road at an intersection, fires multiple rounds at them, killing
one and wounding two others. The principal's passenger also pulls out a
firearm and discharges multiple rounds, but does not hit any of the
intended targets. The two men are arrested and tried together as
codefendants.

The principal perpetrator is charged with murder and two counts
attempted murder. The passenger is charged with aiding and abetting
murder and two counts aiding and abetting attempted murder. At trial the
principal perpetrator testifies his vehicle had been shot at in the same
intersection earlier that day, and he believed if he didn't fire his
weapon, the men on the street corner were going to shoot and kill him.
The trial court refused to add a jury instruction for "unreasonable
self-defense" which would have allowed the jury to find him guilty of
the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter and two counts attempted
voluntary manslaughter. The two men are convicted on all counts.

On appeal, now with separate lawyers, the principal perpetrator has his
conviction overturned and is granted a new trial where he is entitled to
assert the incomplete defense of "unreasonable self-defense." Assume the
new jury trial results in his being convicted of the lesser offenses
voluntary manslaughter and two counts attempted voluntary manslaughter.

 What should happen with his former codefendant\--the passenger who was
convicted of aiding and abetting one count murder and two counts aiding
and abetting attempted murder? Should he likewise have his aiding and
abetting of one count murder and two counts attempted murder overturned
and tried for the lesser crimes of the principal perpetrator? Or should
his conviction of the more severe crime be upheld? See *People v. McCoy,
25 Cal. 4th 1111, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 188, 2001.*

How might the following two theories of aiding and abetting might inform
your response:

"First, an aider and abettor with the necessary mental state is guilty
of the intended crime. Second, under the natural and probable
consequences doctrine, an aider and abettor is guilty not only of the
intended crime, but also for any other offense that was a \"natural and
probable consequence\" of the crime aided and abetted." *Id. 25 Cal. 4th
1111, 1117, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 188, 192.*

Wilcox v. Jeffery

 

**WILCOX v. JEFFERY.**

\[King\'s Bench Division (Lord Goddard, C.J., Humphreys and Devlin,
JJ.), January 26, 1951.\]

***\[ ... \]***

LORD GODDARD, C.J.: **\[ ... \]**Herbert William Wilcox, the proprietor
of a periodical called \"Jazz Illustrated," was charged on an
information that "on Dec. 11, 1949, he did unlawfully aid and abet one
Coleman Hawkins in contravening art. 1 (4) of the Aliens Order, 1920**\[
... \]** Under the Aliens Order, art. 1 (1), it is provided that

> \". . . an alien coming . . . by sea to a place in the United Kingdom
> \-- a) shall not land in the United Kingdom without the leave of an
> Immigration officer. . ."

It is provided by art 1 (4) that:

> "An immigration officer, in accordance with general or special
> directions of the Secretary of State, may, by general order or notice
> or otherwise, attach such conditions as he may think fit to the grant
> of leave to land, and the Secretary of State may at any time vary such
> conditions in such manner as he thinks fit, and the alien shall comply
> with the conditions so attached or varied . . ."

If the alien fails to comply, he is to be in the same position as if he
has landed without permission, *i.e.*,he commits an offence.

The case is concerned with the visit of a celebrated professor of the
saxophone, a gentleman by the name of Hawkins who was a citizen of the
United States. He came here at the invitation of two gentlemen of the
name of Curtis and Hughes, connected with a jazz club which enlivens the
neighbourhood of Willesden. They, apparently, had applied for permission
for Mr. Hawkins land and it was refused, but, nevertheless, this
professor of the saxophone arrived with four French musicians. When they
came to the airport, among the people who were there to greet them was
the appellant. He had not arranged their visit, but he knew they were
coming and he was there to report the arrival of these important
musicians for his magazine. So, evidently, he was regarding the visit of
Mr. Hawkins as a matter which would be of interest to himself and the
magazine which he was editing and selling for profit. Messrs. Curtis and
Hughes arranged a concert at the Princes Theatre, London. The appellant
attended that concert as a spectator. He paid for his ticket. Mr.
Hawkins went on the stage and delighted the audience by playing the
saxophone. The appellant did not get up and protest in the name of the
musicians of England that Mr. Hawkins ought not to be here competing
with them and taking the bread out of their mouths or the wind out of
their instruments. It is not found that he actually applauded, but he
was there having paid to go in, and, no doubt, enjoying the performance,
and then, lo and behold, out comes his magazine with a most, laudatory
description, fully illustrated, of this concert. On those facts the
magistrate has found that he aided and abetted.

Reliance is placed by the prosecution on *R. v. Coney* (1) which dealt
with a prize fight. This case relates to a jazz band concert, but the
particular nature of the entertainment provided, whether by fighting
with bare fists or playing on saxophones, does not seem to me to make
any difference to the question which we have to decide. The fact is that
a man is charged with aiding and abetting an illegal act, and I can find
no authority for saying that it matters what that illegal act is,
provided that the aider and abettor knows the facts sufficiently well to
know that they would constitute an offence in the principal. In *R. v.
Coney* (1) the prize fight took place in the neighbourhood of Ascot, and
four or five men were convicted of aiding and abetting the fight. The
conviction was quashed on the ground that the chairman had not given a
correct direction to the jury when he told them that, as the prisoners
were physically present at the fight, they must be held to have aided
and abetted. That direction, the court held, was wrong, it being too
wide. The matter was very concisely put by CAVE, J., whose judgment was
fully concurred in by that great master of the criminal law, STEPHEN, J.
CAVE, J., said (8 Q.B.D. 540):

> \"Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence
> of aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental
> it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury."

There was not accidental presence in this case. The appellant paid to go
to the concert and he went there because he wanted to report it. He
must, therefore, be held to have been present, taking part, concurring,
or encouraging, whichever word you like to use for expressing this
conception. It was an illegal act on the part of Hawkins to play the
saxophone or any other instrument at this concert. The appellant clearly
knew that it was an unlawful act for him to play. He had gone there to
hear him, and his presence and his payment to go there was an
encouragement. He went there to make use of the performance, because he
went there, as the magistrate finds and was justified in finding, to get
\"copy\" for his newspaper. It might have been entirely different, as I
say, if he had gone there and protested, saying: "The musicians' union
do not like you foreigners coming here and playing and you ought to get
off the stage.\" If he had booed, it might have been some evidence that
he was not aiding and abetting. If he had gone as a member of a *claque*
to try to drown the noise of the saxophone, he might very likely be
found not guilty of aiding and abetting. In this case it seems clear
that he was there, not only to approve and encourage what was done, but
to take advantage of it by getting \"copy\" for his paper. In those
circumstances there was evidence on which the trate could that the
appellant aided and abetted, and for these  reasons I am of opinion that
the appeal fails.

State v. Linscott

 

Maine Supreme Judicial Court

520 A.2d 1067

1987-01-28

**\[ ... \]**

SCOLNIK, Justice.

William Linscott appeals from a judgment following a jury-waived trial
in the Superior Court, Waldo County, convicting him of one count of
murder, **\[ ... \]**and one count of robbery**\[ ... \]**. He contends
that his conviction of intentional or knowing murder as an accomplice
under the accomplice liability statute, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 57(3)(A) (1983),
violated his constitutional right to due process of law in that he
lacked the requisite intent to commit murder. We find no merit in the
defendant's argument and affirm the judgment.

The facts are not in dispute. On December 12, 1984, the defendant, then
unemployed, and two other men --- the defendant's step-brother, Phillip
Willey, and Jeffrey Colby --- drove from his trailer in Belmont, Maine
to the house of a friend, Joel Fuller. Fuller, with a sawed-off shotgun
in his possession, joined the others. The defendant drove to the
residence of Larry Ackley, where Fuller obtained 12-gauge shotgun
shells.

Later that evening, Fuller suggested that the four men drive to the
house of a reputed cocaine dealer, Norman Grenier of Swanville, take
Grenier by surprise, and rob him. The defendant agreed to the plan,
reasoning that Grenier, being a reputed drug dealer, would be extremely
reluctant to call the police and request they conduct a robbery
investigation that might result in the discovery of narcotics in his
possession. Fuller stated that Grenier had purchased two kilograms of
cocaine that day, and that Grenier had been seen with \$50,000 in cash.
Fuller guaranteed the defendant \$10,000 as his share of the proceeds of
the robbery.

The four drove up to Grenier's house, which was situated in a heavily
wooded rural area on a dead-end road in Swanville. The defendant and
Fuller left the car and approached the house. The defendant carried a
hunting knife and switchblade, and Fuller was armed with the shotgun.
**\[ ... \]**

The defendant and Fuller walked around to the back of Grenier's house.
At that time, Grenier and his girlfriend were watching television in
their living room. The defendant and Fuller intended to break in the
back door in order to place themselves between Grenier and the bedroom,
where they believed Grenier kept a loaded shotgun. Because the back door
was blocked by snow, the two men walked around to the front of the
house. Under their revised plan the defendant was to break the living
room picture window whereupon Fuller would show his shotgun to Grenier,
who presumably would be dissuaded from offering any resistance.

The defendant subsequently broke the living room window with his body
without otherwise physically entering the house. Fuller immediately
fired a shot through the broken window, hitting Grenier in the chest.
Fuller left through the broken window after having removed about \$1,300
from Grenier's pants pocket, later returning to the house to retrieve an
empty shotgun casing. **\[ ... \]**

At a jury-waived trial, **\[ ... \]**the defendant testified that he
knew Fuller to be a hunter and that it was not unusual for Fuller to
carry a firearm with him, even at night. He nevertheless stated that he
had no knowledge of any reputation for violence that Fuller may have
had. The defendant further testified that he had no intention of causing
anyone's death in the course of the robbery.

At the completion of the trial **\[ ... \]**the trial justice found the
defendant guilty of robbery and, on a theory of accomplice liability,
found him guilty of murder. The court specifically found that the
defendant possessed the intent to commit the crime of robbery, that
Fuller intentionally or at least knowingly caused the death of Grenier,
and that this murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
defendant's participation in the robbery. However, the court also found
that the defendant did not intend to kill Grenier, and that the
defendant probably would not have participated in the robbery had he
believed that Grenier would be killed in the course of the enterprise.

The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the defendant's conviction
pursuant to the second sentence of subsection 3-A of the accomplice
liability statute, 17-A M.R. S.A. § 57 (1983),[^126] unconstitutionally
violates his right to due process under Article I, section 6-A of the
Maine Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
Constitution. "\[T\]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against
conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact
necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged." *In re
Winship,* 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).
The defendant contends that the accomplice liability statute
impermissi-bly allows the State to find him guilty of murder, which
requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was committed
either intentionally or knowingly, without having to prove either of
these two culpable mental states. Instead, the defendant argues, the
accomplice liability statute permits the State to employ only a mere
negligence standard in convicting him of murder in violation of his
right to due process. We find the defendant's argument to be without
merit.

The second sentence of section 57(3)(A) endorses the "foreseeable
consequence" rule of accomplice liability. *See State v. Goodall,* 407
A.2d 268, 278 (Me.1979).[^127] In that case we stated that

> \[t\]he history of the statute demonstrates that the legislature
> indeed intended to impose liability upon accomplices for those crimes
> that were the reasonably foreseeable consequence of their criminal
> enterprise, *notwithstanding an absence on their part of the same
> culpability required for conviction as a principal to the crime.*

*Id.* (emphasis added). Accordingly, we have stated that section
57(3)(A) is to be interpreted as follows: Under the first sentence of
that section, which is to be read independently of the second sentence,

> liability for a "primary crime" \... \[here, robbery\] is established
> by proof that the actor intended to promote or facilitate that crime.
> Under the second sentence, liability for any "secondary crime" \...
> \[here, murder\] that may have been committed by the principal is
> established upon a two-fold showing: (a) that the actor intended to
> promote the *primary crime,* and (b) that the commission of the
> secondary crime was a "foreseeable consequence" of the actor's
> participation in the primary crime.

*Id.* at 277-278 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original). We have
consistently upheld this interpretation of section 57(3)(A). **\[ ...
\]** We discern no compelling reason to depart from this construction of
the statute.

Furthermore, the foreseeable consequence rule as stated in Section
57(3)(A) merely carries over the objective standards of accomplice
liability as used in the common law. **\[ ... \]**Thus, a rule allowing
for a murder conviction under a theory of accomplice liability based
upon an *objective* standard, despite the absence of evidence that the
defendant possessed the culpable *subjective* mental state that
constitutes an element of the crime of murder, does not represent a
departure from prior Maine law.

**\[ ... \]**

We also do not find fundamentally unfair or disproportionate the grading
scheme for sentencing purposes **\[ ... \]** murder premised on a theory
of accomplice liability,**[\[ ...
\]](#Xecb8f7a7b70f34f8b5b8a8a7a69ebda0fe5912d)\[ ... \]**

The potential penalty of life imprisonment for murder under a theory of
accomplice liability based on an objective standard "does not denote
such punitive severity as to shock the conscience of the public, nor our
own respective or collective sense of fairness." **\[ ... \]**

For the foregoing reasons, we find no constitutional defect in this
statutory provision, nor any fundamental unfairness in its operation.

ORME, Judge:

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** On June 12, 1998, V.T. and two friends, \"Moose\" and
Joey, went to a relative\'s apartment to avoid being picked up by police
for curfew violations. The boys ended up spending the entire night at
the apartment.

**\[ ... \]** The next morning, the relative briefly left to run an
errand, while the boys remained in her apartment. She returned about
fifteen minutes later to find the boys gone, the door to her apartment
wide open, and two of her guns missing. She immediately went in search
of the group and found them hanging out together near her apartment
complex. She confronted the boys about the theft of her guns and
demanded that they return them to her. When they failed to do so, she
reported the theft to the police.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X6b3a8dc24f12aaeb6e30f65c75cafde2700b047)

**\[ ... \]**Two days after the theft of her guns, she discovered that
her camcorder, which had been in the apartment when the boys visited,
was also missing, and she immediately reported its theft to the police.
The police found the camcorder at a local pawn shop, where it had been
pawned on the same day the guns were stolen.

**\[ ... \]**Still inside the camcorder was a videotape featuring
footage of V.T., Moose, and Joey. The tape included a segment where
Moose telephoned a friend, in V.T.\'s presence, and discussed pawning
the stolen camcorder. V.T. never spoke or gestured during any of this
footage.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xc1a7ae64f37d70d34753bd7ffaffd07679dc2b7)

V.T. was**\[ ... \]** charged with two counts of theft of a firearm; one
count of theft, relating to the camcorder**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]\[ ... \]**V.T. was tried under an accomplice theory on the
three theft charges. The court found that V.T. had committed class A
misdemean- or theft of the camcorder **\[ ... \]**The juvenile court
summarized the basis for its adjudication concerning the camcorder theft
as follows:

> I am going to find him guilty and I think the additional information
> that I have here that brings me peace of mind is that he was present a
> second time, he was shown on the cameorder when the camcorder was
> being handled at a time when he could\'ve distanced himself from the
> activity. Not only do I have him there once with the group \... on the
> second incident \... there is no gap on him being there when \[the
> camcorder\] is being handled and talked about and used in the confines
> of a room with a group of friends and those who were involved in this
> illegal activity.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**The sole issue presented by V.T. is whether there was
sufficient evidence to support the adjudication that he was an
accomplice in the theft of the camcorder. **\[ ... \]**

19 Utah\'s accomplice liability statute, Utah Code Ann. § 76-2-202
(1999), provides:

> Every person, acting with the mental state required for the commission
> of an offense who directly commits the offense, who solicits,
> requests, commands, encourages, or intentionally aids another person
> to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally
> liable as a party for such conduct.

As with any other crime, the State must prove the elements of accomplice
liability beyond a reasonable doubt. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** The State argues that V.T.\'s continued presence during
the theft and subsequent phone conversation about selling the camcorder,
coupled with his friendship with the other two boys, is enough evidence
to support the inference that he had \"encouraged\" the other two in
committing the theft and that he is therefore an accomplice to the
crime. Black\'s Law Dictionary defines encourage as: \"\[tlo instigate;
to incite to action; to embolden; to help.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 547
(ith ed.1999). The plain meaning of the word confirms that to encourage
others to take criminal action requires some form of active behavior, or
at least verbalization, by a defendant. Passive behavior, such as mere
presence-even continuous presence-absent evidence that the defendant
affirmatively did something to instigate, incite, embolden, or help
others in committing a crime is not enough to qualify as
\"encouragement\" as that term is commonly used.

**\[ ... \]**The case law in Utah is consistent with this definition: \"
\'Mere presence, or even prior knowledge, does not make one an
accomplice\'\" to a crime absent evidence showing-beyond a reasonable
doubt-that defendant \"advise\[d\], instigate\[d\], encourage\[d\], or
assist\[ed\] in perpetuation of the crime.\" **\[ ... \]**

The juvenile court\'s conclusion that V.T. was an accomplice to the
camcorder theft was not supported by the evidence in this case. No
evidence whatsoever was produced indicating V.T. had encouraged-much
less that he solicited, requested, commanded or intentionally aided-the
other two boys in the theft of the camcorder.[^128]

Bailey v. Commonwealth

 

Supreme Court of Virginia

229 Va. 258

Record No. 840357

1985-04-26

**\[ ... \]**

CARRICO, C.J.,

**\[ ... \]**

The question on appeal is whether it was proper to convict Bailey of
involuntary manslaughter when, in his absence, the victim was killed by
police officers responding to reports from Bailey concerning the
victim's conduct.

The death of the victim, Gordon E. Murdock, occurred during the late
evening of May 21, 1983, in the aftermath of an extended and
vituperative conversation between Bailey and Murdock over their
citizens' band radios. During the conversation, which was to be the last
in a series of such violent incidents, Bailey and Murdock cursed and
threatened each other repeatedly.

Bailey and Murdock lived about two miles apart in the Roanoke area. On
the evening in question, each was intoxicated. Bailey had consumed a
"twelve-pack" of beer and a "fifth of liquor" since mid-afternoon; a
test of Murdock's blood made during an autopsy showed alcoholic content
of ".271% \... by weight." Murdock was also "legally blind," with vision
of only 3/200 in the right eye and 2/200 in the left. Bailey knew that
Murdock had "a problem with vision" and that he was intoxicated on the
night in question.

Bailey also knew that Murdock owned a handgun and had boasted "about how
he would use it and shoot it and scare people off with it." Bailey knew
further that Murdock was easily agitated and that he became especially
angry if anyone disparaged his war hero, General George S. Patton.
During the conversation in question, Bailey implied that General Patton
and Murdock himself were homosexuals.

Also during the conversation, Bailey persistently demanded that Murdock
arm himself with his handgun and wait on his front porch for Bailey to
come and injure or kill him. Murdock responded by saying he would be
waiting on his front porch, and he told Bailey to "kiss \[his\] mother
or \[his\] wife and children goodbye because \[he would\] never go back
home."

Bailey then made two anonymous telephone calls to the Roanoke City
Police Department. In the first, Bailey reported "a man . . . out on the
porch \[at Murdock's address\] waving a gun around." A police car was
dispatched to the address, but the officers reported they did not "see
anything."

Bailey called Murdock back on the radio and chided him for not "going
out on the porch." More epithets and threats were exchanged. Bailey told
Murdock he was "going to come up there in a blue and white car"[^129]
and demanded that Murdock "step out there on the . . . porch" with his
gun "in \[his\] hands" because he, Bailey, would "be there in just a
minute."

Bailey telephoned the police again. This time, Bailey identified Murdock
by name and told the dispatcher that Murdock had "a gun on the porch,"
had "threatened to shoot up the neighborhood," and was "talking about
shooting anything that moves." Bailey insisted that the police "come out
here and straighten this man out." Bailey refused to identify himself,
explaining that he was "right next to \[Murdock\] out here" and feared
revealing his identity.

Three uniformed police officers, Chambers, Beavers, and Turner, were
dispatched to Murdock's home. None of the officers knew that Murdock was
intoxicated or that he was in an agitated state of mind. Only Officer
Beavers knew that Murdock's eyesight was bad, and he did not know
"exactly how bad it was." Beavers also knew that Murdock would get "a
little 10-96 (mental subject) occasionally" and would "curse and carry
on" when he was drinking.

When the officers arrived on the scene, they found that Murdock's "porch
light was on" but observed no one on the porch. After several minutes
had elapsed, the officers observed Murdock come out of his house with
"something shiny in his hand." Murdock sat down on the top step of the
porch and placed the shiny object beside him.

Officer Chambers approached Murdock from the side of the porch and told
him to "\[l\]eave the gun alone and walk down the stairs away from it."
Murdock "just sat there." When Chambers repeated his command, Murdock
cursed him. Murdock then reached for the gun, stood up, advanced in
Chambers' direction, and opened fire. Chambers retreated and was not
struck.

All three officers returned fire, and Murdock was struck. Lying wounded
on the porch, he said several times, "I didn't know you was the police."
He died from "a gunshot wound of the left side of the chest." **\[ ...
\]**

In an instruction granted below and not questioned on appeal, the trial
court told the jury it should convict Bailey if it found that his
negligence or reckless conduct was so gross and culpable as to indicate
a callous disregard for human life and that his actions were the
proximate cause or a concurring cause of Murdock's death. Bailey
concedes that the evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable
to the Commonwealth, would support a finding that his actions
constituted negligence so gross and culpable as to indicate a callous
disregard for human life. He contends, however, that he "did not kill
Murdock."

**\[ ... \]**The Attorney General concedes that Bailey was not a
principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, but
maintains that he was a principal in the first degree.

Countering, Bailey argues he was not a principal in the first degree
because only the immediate perpetrators of crime occupy that status.
Here, Bailey says, the immediate perpetrators of Murdock's killing were
the police officers who returned Murdock's fire.[^130] He was in his own
home two miles away, Bailey asserts, and did not control the actors in
the confrontation at Murdock's home or otherwise participate in the
events that occurred there. **\[ ... \]**

We have adopted the rule in this Commonwealth, however, that one who
effects a criminal act through an innocent or unwitting agent is a
principal in the first degree. *Collins* v. *Commonwealth,* 226 Va. 223,
233, 307 S.E.2d 884, 890 (1983) (undercover policewoman ruled innocent
agent to collect fees for defendant charged with pandering); **\[ ...
\]**.

Bailey argues that the present case is distinguishable from *Collins.*
There, Bailey says, the accused and the undercover policewoman were
working in concert, pursuing a common goal of soliciting and collecting
fees for sexual favors; although the policewoman was innocent of the
crime of pandering because she had no intent to perform sexual acts, the
accused was guilty nevertheless because the fees were collected on his
behalf. Here, Bailey asserts, he and the police shared no common scheme
or goal. Neither, Bailey says, did he share a common goal with Murdock;
indeed, "Murdock's intent was to kill Bailey."

The question is not, however, whether Murdock was Bailey's innocent or
unwitting agent but whether the police officers who responded to
Bailey's calls occupied that status. And, in resolving this question, we
believe it is irrelevant whether Bailey and the police shared a common
scheme or goal. What is relevant is whether Bailey undertook to cause
Murdock harm and used the police to accomplish that purpose, a question
which we believe must be answered affirmatively.

Knowing that Murdock was intoxicated, nearly blind, and in an agitated
state of mind, Bailey orchestrated a scenario on the evening of May 21,
1983, whose finale was bound to include harmful consequences to Murdock,
either in the form of his arrest or his injury or death. **\[ ... \]**

From a factual standpoint, it is clear from the sum total of Bailey's
actions that his purpose in calling the police was to induce them to go
to Murdock's home and unwittingly create the appearance that Bailey
himself had arrived to carry out the threats he had made over the radio.
And, from a legal standpoint, it is clear that, for Bailey's mischievous
purpose, the police officers who went to Murdock's home and confronted
him were acting as Bailey's innocent or unwitting agents.

But, Bailey argues, he cannot be held criminally liable in this case
unless Murdock's death was the natural and probable result of Bailey's
conduct. Bailey maintains that either Murdock's own reckless and
criminal conduct in opening fire upon the police or the officers' return
fire constituted an independent, intervening cause absolving Bailey of
guilt.

We have held, however, that "\[a\]n intervening act which is reasonably
foreseeable cannot be relied upon as breaking the chain of causal
connection between an original act of negligence and subsequent injury."
*Delawder* v. *Commonwealth,* 214 Va. 55, 58, 196 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1973)
(defendant lost control of vehicle while racing and struck pedestrian;
striking of defendant's vehicle by other car not intervening cause).
Here, under instructions not questioned on appeal, the jury determined
that the fatal consequences of Bailey's reckless conduct could
reasonably have been foreseen and, accordingly, that Murdock's death was
not the result of an independent, intervening cause but of Bailey's
misconduct. At the least, the evidence presented a jury question on
these issues. **\[ ... \]**

*Affirmed.*

Introduction

 

To a greater degree than any of the other crimes we study in this class,
the very definition of rape has been a subject of dispute and reform in
recent years. Perhaps that is because the basic result element that rape
law criminalizes---sexual intercourse---is not, unlike death or battery,
itself considered bad. When someone intentionally kills another, there
is usually little question (except in cases of self-defense) that the
result is bad and that a crime may have occurred. Unlike most
intentional killing, intentional sex is not inherently wrong. Indeed, in
some situations, much of the evidence of rape may rest in the
perceptions and interpretations of the involved parties. The traditional
elements of rape law are: 1) sexual intercourse; 2) with force; 3) and
lack of consent. Because the sexual intercourse element of rape can be
difficult to distinguish from lawful, intentional behavior, rape law has
struggled to create a regime that balances the punishment of wrongdoers
with the protection of the rights of the accused. Originally, rape law
established strict rules governing punishable behavior that were
under-inclusive and strongly protected accused men: for example, a claim
of rape had to include the use of physical force by the accused and
physical resistance by the victim. Additionally, there was a spousal
exception to rape, so that husbands could not be criminally liable for
rape of their wives. As the cases in this section demonstrate, however,
rape law reform in the past several decades has dramatically affected
these requirements. Namely, feminist legal reformers have challenged and
in many jurisdictions weakened or eliminated the force requirement. That
has shifted more legal focus onto the question whether there was
consent. Consider what problems consent itself may have as a central
element of rape law. As you read the cases and essays in this section,
consider how different formulations of rape law balance several very
serious considerations of our criminal system: punishing wrongdoers;
differentiating between levels of blameworthiness; and protecting the
rights of defendants. What evidentiary or normative roles did the
traditional rape requirements play? What are the risks of limiting or
removing them? How should our system balance the risks of
over-inclusivity and under-inclusivity? What social and intimate
relationships between men and women do the various possible rape rules
promote and change? And as always, how do these questions implicate the
justifications of punishment such as retribution and deterrence?

CA Penal Code, Title 9 secs. 261-269 (2011)

 

## CA Penal Code §261

\(a\) Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person
not the spouse of the perpetrator, under any of the following
circumstances:

> \(1\) Where a person is incapable, because of a mental disorder or
> developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent, and
> this is known or reasonably should be known to the person committing
> the act. Notwithstanding the existence of a conservatorship pursuant
> to the provisions of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1
> (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and
> Institutions Code), the prosecuting attorney shall prove, as an
> element of the crime, that a mental disorder or developmental or
> physical disability rendered the alleged victim incapable of giving
> consent.
>
> \(2\) Where it is accomplished against a person\'s will by means of
> force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful
> bodily injury on the person or another.
>
> \(3\) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating
> or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this
> condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the
> accused.
>
> \(4\) Where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the
> act, and this is known to the accused. As used in this paragraph,
> \"unconscious of the nature of the act\" means incapable of resisting
> because the victim meets one of the following conditions:
>
> \(A\) Was unconscious or asleep.
>
> \(B\) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant that the act
> occurred.
>
> \(C\) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the
> essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator\'s fraud
> in fact.
>
> \(D\) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the
> essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator\'s
> fraudulent representation that the sexual penetration served a
> professional purpose when it served no professional purpose.
>
> \(5\) Where a person submits under the belief that the person
> committing the act is the victim\'s spouse, and this belief is induced
> by any artifice, pretense, or concealment practiced by the accused,
> with intent to induce the belief.
>
> \(6\) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\'s will by
> threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other
> person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator
> will execute the threat. As used in this paragraph, \"threatening to
> retaliate\" means a threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, or to
> inflict extreme pain, serious bodily injury, or death.
>
> \(7\) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\'s will by
> threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate,
> arrest, or deport the victim or another, and the victim has a
> reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. As used
> in this paragraph, \"public official\" means a person employed by a
> governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position,
> to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not
> actually have to be a public official.

\(b\) As used in this section, \"duress\" means a direct or implied
threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to coerce a
reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which
otherwise would not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which
one otherwise would not have submitted. The total circumstances,
including the age of the victim, and his or her relationship to the
defendant, are factors to consider in appraising the existence of
duress.

\(c\) As used in this section, \"menace\" means any threat, declaration,
or act which shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.

## CA Penal Code § 261.5

> with a minor less than two years younger than the adult is liable for
> a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand dollars (\$2,000).

> \(B\) An adult who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse
> with a minor at least two years younger than the adult is liable for a
> civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars (\$5,000).

> with a minor at least three years younger than the adult is liable for
> a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars (\$10,000).
>
> \(D\) An adult over the age of 21 years who engages in an act of
> unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under 16 years of age is
> liable for a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars
> (\$25,000).
>
> \(2\) The district attorney may bring actions to recover civil
> penalties pursuant to this subdivision. From the amounts collected for
> each case, an amount equal to the costs of pursuing the action shall
> be deposited with the treasurer of the county in which the judgment
> was entered, and the remainder shall be deposited in the Underage
> Pregnancy Prevention Fund, which is hereby created in the State
> Treasury. Amounts deposited in the Underage Pregnancy Prevention Fund
> may be used only for the purpose of preventing underage pregnancy upon
> appropriation by the Legislature.
>
> \(3\) In addition to any punishment imposed under this section, the
> judge may assess a fine not to exceed seventy dollars (\$70) against
> any person who violates this section with the proceeds of this fine to
> be used in accordance with Section 1463.23. The court shall, however,
> take into consideration the defendant\'s ability to pay, and no
> defendant shall be denied probation because of his or her inability to
> pay the fine permitted under this subdivision.

## CA Penal Code § 261.6

In prosecutions under Section 261, 262, 286, 288a, or 289, in which
consent is at issue, \"consent\" shall be defined to mean positive
cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will. The
person must act freely and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature
of the act or transaction involved.

A current or previous dating or marital relationship shall not be
sufficient to constitute consent where consent is at issue in a
prosecution under Section 261, 262, 286, 288a, or 289.

Nothing in this section shall affect the admissibility of evidence or
the burden of proof on the issue of consent.

## CA Penal Code § 261.7

In prosecutions under Section 261, 262, 286, 288a, or 289, in which
consent is at issue, evidence that the victim suggested, requested, or
otherwise communicated to the defendant that the defendant use a condom
or other birth control device, without additional evidence of consent,
is not sufficient to constitute consent.

sexual intercourse accomplished under any of the following
circumstances:

> \(1\) Where it is accomplished against a person\'s will by means of
> force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful
> bodily injury on the person or another.
>
> \(2\) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating

>
> \(4\) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\'s will by
> threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other
> person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator
> will execute the threat. As used in this paragraph, \"threatening to
> retaliate\" means a threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, or to
> inflict extreme pain, serious bodily injury, or death.
>
> \(5\) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\'s will by
> threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate,
> arrest, or deport the victim or another, and the victim has a
> reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. As used
> in this paragraph, \"public official\" means a person employed by a
> governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position,
> to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not
> actually have to be a public official.

\(b\) As used in this section, \"duress\" means a direct or implied
threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to coerce a
reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which
otherwise would not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which
one otherwise would not have submitted. The total circumstances,
including the age of the victim, and his or her relationship to the
defendant, are factors to consider in apprising the existence of duress.

\(c\) As used in this section, \"menace\" means any threat, declaration,
or act that shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.

\(d\) If probation is granted upon conviction of a violation of this
section, the conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, one

> \(1\) That the defendant make payments to a battered women\'s shelter,
> up to a maximum of one thousand dollars (\$1,000).
>
> \(2\) That the defendant reimburse the victim for reasonable costs of
> counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are the
> direct result of the defendant\'s offense.

For any order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women\'s
shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under this
subdivision, the court shall make a determination of the defendant\'s
ability to pay. In no event shall any order to make payments to a
battered women\'s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the
defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child
support. Where the injury to a married person is caused in whole or in
part by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this
section, the community property may not be used to discharge the
liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse,
required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995,
or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured
spouse and dependents, required by this section, until all separate
property of the offending spouse is exhausted.

## CA Penal Code § 263

The essential guilt of rape consists in the outrage to the person and
feelings of the victim of the rape. Any sexual penetration, however
slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.

## CA Penal Code § 264

> \(a\) Exce**\[ ... \]**

ho induces any other person to engage in sexual intercourse, sexual
penetration, oral copulation, or sodomy when his or her consent is
procured by false or fraudulent representation or pretense that is made
with the intent to create fear, and which does induce fear, and that
would cause a reasonable person in like circumstances to act contrary to
the person\'s free will, and does cause the victim to so act, is
punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year
or in the state prison for two, three, or four years.

As used in this section, \"fear\" means the fear of physical injury or
death to the person or to any relative of the person or member of the

Model Penal Code 213.2 (Approved Tentative) 2016

 

The American Law Institute (ALI) is a group of lawyers and legal
scholars whose goal is to clarify the common law. They do so via the
Model Penal Code, first promulgated in 1962. The rape provisions (213 et
seq) have never been widely adopted. Beginning in 2014, the ALI's
Council met to begin the process of revising the rape provisions. The
process has been highly fraught. Today, six years into the process, very
little has been settled. 

 

Among the most interesting debates is the question of how to define
"consent."  Arguments included whether or not the burden of proof should
be on the defendant, what consent means in the eyes of the law, and what
fraudulent consent would look like, among other things. 

 

In the 2016 Tentative Draft No. 2, ALI defined § 213.0(3) Definition of
Consent and § 213.2 Sexual Penetration Without Consent. 

 

SECTION 213.2 - SEXUAL PENETRATION WITHOUT CONSENT.

Sexual Penetration Without Consent. An actor is guilty of Sexual
Penetration Without Consent if he or she engages in an act of sexual
penetration and knows, or consciously disregards a substantial risk,
that the other person has not given consent. 

Sexual Penetration Without Consent is a felony of the fourth degree. 

** **

SECTION 213.0 DEFINITIONS

\(3\) "Consent"

\(a\) "Consent" means a person's behavior, including words and conduct -
both action and inaction - that communicates the person's willingness to
engage in a specific act of sexual penetration or sexual contact

 

\(b\) Notwithstanding subsection (3)(a) of this Section, behavior does
not constitute consent when it is the result of conduct specifically
prohibited by Sections 13 \[reserved\].

\(c\) Consent may be expressed or it may be inferred from a person's
behavior. Neither verbal nor physical resistance is required to
establish the absence of consent; the person's behavior must be assessed
in the context of all the circumstances to determine where the person
has consented.

\(d\) Consent may be revoked any time before or during the act of sexual
penetration or sexual contact, by behavior communicating that the person
is no longer willing. A clear verbal refusal - such as "No," "Stop," or
"Don't" suffices to establish the lack of consent. A clear verbal
refusal also suffices to withdraw previously communicated willingness in
the absence of subsequent behavior that communicates willingness before
the sexual act.

CA Education Code, sec. 67386 (2016)

 

**CA Education Code § 67386.** Adoption of policy concerning sexual
assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking; receipt of
state funds; contents of policy

\(a\) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance,
the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of
the California State University, the Regents of the University of
California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary
institutions shall adopt a policy concerning sexual assault, domestic
violence, dating violence, and stalking, as defined in the federal
Higher Education Act of 1965 ([20 U.S.C. Sec.
1092(f)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=20USCAS1092&originatingDoc=N66A4B660725711E5A72BEE8A4746096C&refType=SP&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.DocLink)#co_pp_ae0d0000c5150)),
involving a student, both on and off campus. The policy shall include
all of the following:

\(1\) An affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether
consent was given by both parties to sexual activity. "Affirmative
consent" means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage
in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in
the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent
of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest
or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.
Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can
be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between
the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them,
should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.

\(2\) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in any disciplinary
process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative
consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the
sexual activity under either of the following circumstances:

\(A\) The accused\'s belief in affirmative consent arose from the
intoxication or recklessness of the accused.

\(B\) The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances
known to the accused at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant
affirmatively consented.

\(3\) A policy that the standard used in determining whether the
elements of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated is
the preponderance of the evidence.

\(4\) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary
process, it shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that
the complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the
accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was
unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following
circumstances:

\(A\) The complainant was asleep or unconscious.

\(B\) The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs,
alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the
fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity.

\(C\) The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or
physical condition.

\(b\) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance,
the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of
the California State University, the Regents of the University of
California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary
institutions shall adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and
protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence,
and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and
current professional standards. At a minimum, the policies and protocols
shall cover all of the following:

\(1\) A policy statement on how the institution will provide appropriate
protections for the privacy of individuals involved, including
confidentiality.

\(2\) Initial response by the institution\'s personnel to a report of an
incident, including requirements specific to assisting the victim,
providing information in writing about the importance of preserving
evidence, and the identification and location of witnesses.

\(3\) Response to stranger and nonstranger sexual assault.

\(4\) The preliminary victim interview, including the development of a
victim interview protocol, and a comprehensive followup victim
interview, as appropriate.

\(5\) Contacting and interviewing the accused.

\(6\) Seeking the identification and location of witnesses.

\(7\) Providing written notification to the victim about the
availability of, and contact information for, on- and off-campus
resources and services, and coordination with law enforcement, as
appropriate.

\(8\) Participation of victim advocates and other supporting people.

\(9\) Investigating allegations that alcohol or drugs were involved in
the incident.

\(10\) Providing that an individual who participates as a complainant or
witness in an investigation of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating
violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for
a violation of the institution\'s student conduct policy at or near the
time of the incident, unless the institution determines that the
violation was egregious, including, but not limited to, an action that
places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves
plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty.

\(11\) The role of the institutional staff supervision.

\(12\) A comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus
officials involved in investigating and adjudicating sexual assault,
domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.

\(13\) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third
parties.

\(c\) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance,
the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of
the California State University, the Regents of the University of
California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary
institutions shall, to the extent feasible, enter into memoranda of
understanding, agreements, or collaborative partnerships with existing
on-campus and community-based organizations, including rape crisis
centers, to refer students for assistance or make services available to
students, including counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy,
and legal assistance, and including resources for the accused.

\(d\) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance,
the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of
the California State University, the Regents of the University of
California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary
institutions shall implement comprehensive prevention and outreach
programs addressing sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence,
and stalking. A comprehensive prevention program shall include a range
of prevention strategies, including, but not limited to, empowerment
programming for victim prevention, awareness raising campaigns, primary
prevention, bystander intervention, and risk reduction. Outreach
programs shall be provided to make students aware of the institution\'s
policy on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and
stalking. At a minimum, an outreach program shall include a process for
contacting and informing the student body, campus organizations,
athletic programs, and student groups about the institution\'s overall
sexual assault policy, the practical implications of an affirmative
consent standard, and the rights and responsibilities of students under
the policy.

\(e\) Outreach programming shall be included as part of every incoming
student\'s orientation.

Rusk v. State: Dissent

 

WILNER, JUDGE, dissenting:

The majority\'s error, in my judgment, is not in their exposition of the
underlying principles of law that must govern this case, but rather in
the manner that they have applied those principles. . . .

Under the guise of judging the sufficiency of the evidence presented
against appellant, they have tacitly perhaps unwittingly, but
nonetheless effectively substitutes their own view of the evidence (and
the inferences that may fairly be drawn from it) for that of the judge
and jury. In so doing, they have not only improperly invaded the
province allotted to those tribunals, but, at the same time, have
perpetuated and given new life to myths about the crime of rape that
have no place in our law today. . . .

** **

[Md. Annot. Code art. 27, s
463(a)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000018&cite=MDCDART27S463&originatingDoc=I5f02501a345211d98b61a35269fc5f88&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default))
considers three types of conduct as constituting second degree rape. We
are concerned only with the first: a person is guilty of rape in the
second degree if he (1) engages in vaginal intercourse with another
person, (2) by force or threat of force, (3) against the will, and (4)
without the consent of the other person. There is no real question here
as to the first, third, or fourth elements of the crime. The evidence
was certainly sufficient to show that appellant had vaginal intercourse
with the victim, and that such act was against her will and without her
consent. The point at issue is whether it was accomplished by force or
threat of force; and I think that in viewing the evidence, that point
should remain ever clear. Consent is not the issue here, only whether
there was sufficient evidence of force or the threat of force.

** **

Unfortunately, courts, including in the present case a majority of this
one, often tend to confuse these two elements force and lack of consent
and to think of them as one. They are not. They mean, and require,
different things. What seems to cause the confusion what, indeed, has
become a common denominator of both elements is the notion that the
victim must actively resist the attack upon her. If she fails to offer
sufficient resistance (sufficient to the satisfaction of the judge), a
court is entitled, or at least presumes the entitlement, to find that
there was no force or threat of force, or that the act was not against
her will, or that she actually consented to it, or some unarticulated
combination or synthesis of these elements that leads to the ultimate
conclusion that the victim was not raped. Thus it is that the focus is
almost entirely on the extent of resistance The victim\'s acts, rather
than those of her assailant. Attention is directed not to the wrongful
stimulus, but to the victim\'s reactions to it. Right or wrong, that
seems to be the current state of the Maryland law; and, notwithstanding
its uniqueness in the criminal law, and its illogic, until changed by
statute or the Court of Appeals, I accept it as binding.

 

But what is required of a woman being attacked or in danger of attack?
How much resistance must she offer? Where is that line to be drawn
between requiring that she either risk serious physical harm, perhaps
death, on the one hand, or be termed a willing partner on the other?
Some answers were given in [Hazel v. State, 221 Md. 464, 157 A.2d 922
(1960)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1960105848&pubNum=162&originatingDoc=I5f02501a345211d98b61a35269fc5f88&refType=RP&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)),
although, as in so many cases, they were stated in the context of both
the requirement of force and the lack of consent. . . . 

 

From . . . pronouncements in Hazel, this Court has articulated what the
majority refers to as a "rule of reason" I. e., that "where the
victim\'s story could not be corroborated by wounds, bruises or
disordered clothing, the lack of consent could be shown by fear based

As so phrased, I do not consider this to be a rule of reason at all; it
is highly unreasonable, and again mixes the element of consent with that
of force. But what I do accept is what the Court of Appeals said in
Hazel : (1) if the acts and threats of the defendant were reasonably
calculated to create in the mind of the victim having regard to the
circumstances in which she was placed a real apprehension, due to fear,
of imminent bodily harm, serious enough to impair or overcome her will
to resist, then such acts and threats are the equivalent of force; (2)
submission is not the equivalent of consent; and (3) the real test is
whether the assault was committed without the consent and against the
will of the prosecuting witness.

 

Upon this basis, the evidence against appellant must be considered. . .
. The victim - I'll call her Pat - attended a high school reunion. . . .
We know nothing about Pat and appellant. We don't know how big they are,
what they look like, what their life experiences have been. We don't
know if appellant is larger or smaller than she, stronger or weaker. We
don't know what the inflection was in his voice as he dangled her car
keys in front of her. We can't tell whether this was in a jocular vein
or a truly threatening one. We have no idea what his mannerisms were.
The trial judge and the jury could discern some of these things, of
course, because they could observe the two people in court and could
listen to what they said and how they said it. But all we know is that,
between midnight and 1:00 a.m., in a neighborhood that was strange to
Pat, appellant took her car keys, demanded that she accompany him, and
most assuredly implied that unless she did so, at the very least, she
might be stranded. . . . 

 

How does the majority Opinion view these events? It starts by noting
that Pat was a 21-year old mother who was separated from her husband but
not yet divorced, as though that had some significance. To me, it has
none, except perhaps (when coupled with the further characterization
that Pat and Terry had gone "bar hopping") to indicate an underlying
suspicion, for which there is absolutely no support in the record, that
Pat was somehow "on the make". Even more alarming, and unwarranted,
however, is the majority\'s analysis of Pat\'s initial reflections on
whether to report what had happened. 

 

It is this type of reasoning if indeed "reasoning" is the right word for
it that is particularly distressing. The concern expressed by Pat, made
even more real by the majority Opinion of this Court, is one that is
common among rape victims, and largely accounts for the fact that most
incidents of forcible rape go unreported by the victim. If appellant had
desired, and Pat had given, her wallet instead of her body, there would
be no question about appellant\'s guilt of robbery. Taking the car keys
under those circumstances would certainly have supplied the requisite
threat of force or violence and negated the element of consent. No one
would seriously contend that because she failed to raise a hue and cry
she had consented to the theft of her money. Why then is such
life-threatening action necessary when it is her personal dignity that
is being stolen?

 

Rape has always been considered a most serious crime, one that
traditionally carried the heaviest penalty. But until recently, it
remained shrouded in the taboos and myths of a Victorian age, and little
real attention was given to how rapes occur, how they may be prevented,
and how a victim can best protect herself from injury when an attack
appears inevitable. 

 

As the result of the Battelle Study, we now know some things about this
crime that we could only guess at before....

 

Of particular significance is what was learned about Resistance. The
most common type of resistance offered by victims is Verbal. Note:
verbal resistance Is resistance! In cases arising in the large cities,
only 12.7% Of the victims attempted flight, and only 12% Offered
physical resistance. The reason for this is apparent from the next thing
learned: that "(r)ape victims who resisted were more likely to be
injured than ones who did not." . . . .

 

Where does this leave us but where we started? A judge and a jury,
observing the witnesses and hearing their testimony, concluded without
dissent that there was sufficient evidence to find beyond a reasonable
doubt that appellant had sexual intercourse with Pat by force or threat
of force against her will and without her consent; in other words, that
the extent of her resistance and the reasons for her failure to resist
further were reasonable. No claim is made here that the jury was
misinstructed on the law of rape. Yet a majority of this Court, without
the ability to see and hear the witnesses, has simply concluded that, in
Their judgment, Pat\'s fear was not a reasonable one, or that there was
no fear at all. . . .

 

 

. . . Brushing all of this aside, they have countermanded the judgment
of the trial court and jury and declared Pat to have been, in effect, an
adulteress. . . .

Synopsis

Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, Durham County, Anthony M.
Brannon, J., of kidnapping and second-degree rape, and he appealed. The
[Court of Appeals, 61 N.C.App. 454, 300 S.E.2d
857](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1983116016&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)),
found no error. Defendant again appealed. The Supreme Court, Mitchell,
J., held that: (1) evidence failed to establish that defendant had
intent to rape victim at time that he removed her from school grounds,
and (2) though evidence established that, even in absence of physical
resistance by victim, act of sexual intercourse was against her will, it
did not establish element of force necessary to sustain second-degree
rape conviction.

 

Reversed and remanded. 

 

Opinion

 

MITCHELL, Justice.

 

The defendant raises on appeal the question whether the evidence of his
guilt of \... second degree rape was sufficient to support his
conviction \.... For reasons discussed herein, we conclude the evidence
was insufficient to support his conviction of \[second degree rape\].

 

The State's evidence tended to show that at the time the incident
occurred the defendant and the prosecuting witness in this case, Cottie
Brown, had been involved for approximately six months in a consensual
sexual relationship[^131]. During the six months the two had conflicts
at times and Brown would leave the apartment she shared with the
defendant to stay with her mother. She testified that she would return
to the defendant and the apartment they shared when he called to tell
her to return. Brown \*401 testified that she and the defendant had
sexual relations throughout their relationship. Although she sometimes
enjoyed their sexual relations[^132], she often had sex with the
defendant just to accommodate him. On those occasions, she would stand
still and remain entirely passive while the defendant undressed her and
had intercourse with her.

 

Brown testified that at times their consensual sexual relations involved
some violence. The defendant had struck her several times throughout the
relationship when she refused to give him money or refused to do what he
wanted. Around May 15, 1981, the defendant struck her after asking her
for money that she refused to give him. Brown left the apartment she
shared with the defendant and moved in with her mother. She did not have
intercourse with the defendant after May 15 until the alleged rape on
June 15. After Brown left the defendant, he called her several times and
visited her at Durham Technical Institute where she was enrolled in
classes. When he visited her they talked about their relationship. Brown
testified that she did not tell him she wanted to break off their
relationship because she was afraid he would be angry.

 

On June 15, 1981, Brown arrived at Durham Technical Institute by taxicab
to find the defendant standing close to the school \*\*472 door. The
defendant blocked her path as she walked toward the door and asked her
where she had moved. Brown refused to tell him, and the defendant
grabbed her arm, saying that she was going with him. Brown testified
that it would have taken some effort to pull away. The two walked toward
the parking lot and Brown told the defendant she would walk with him if
he let her go. The defendant then released her. She testified that she
did not run away from him because she was afraid of him.[^133] She
stated that other students were nearby.

 

Brown stated that she and the defendant then began a casually paced walk
in the neighborhood around the school. They walked, sometimes side by
side, sometimes with Brown slightly behind the defendant. As they walked
they talked about their relationship. Brown said the defendant did not
hold her or help her along in any way as they walked. The defendant
talked about Brown's "dogging" him and making him seem a fool and about
Brown's mother's interference in the relationship. When the \*402
defendant and Brown left the parking lot, the defendant threatened to
"fix" her face so that her mother could see he was not playing. While
they were walking out of the parking lot, Brown told the defendant she
wanted to go to class. He replied that she was going to miss class that
day.

 

The two continued to walk away from the school. Brown testified that the
defendant continually talked about their relationship as they walked,
but that she paid little attention to what he said because she was
preoccupied with her own thoughts. They passed several people. They
walked along several streets and went down a path close to a wooded area
where they stopped to talk. The defendant asked again where Brown had
moved. She asked him whether he would let her go if she told him her
address. The defendant then asked whether the relationship was over and
Brown told him it was. He then said that since everyone could see her
but him he had a right to make love to her again. Brown said
nothing.[^134]

 

The two turned around at that point and began walking towards a street
they had walked down previously. Changing directions, they walked \...
side by side with Brown sometimes slightly behind. The defendant did not
hold or touch Brown as they walked. Brown testified that the defendant
did not say where they were going but that, when he said he wanted to
make love, she knew he was going to the house of a friend. She said they
had gone to the house on prior occasions to have sex. The defendant and
Brown passed the same group of men they had passed previously. Brown did
not ask for assistance[^135] because some of the men were friends of the
defendant, and she assumed they would not help. The defendant and Brown
continued to walk to the house of one of the defendant's friends,
Lawrence Taylor.

 

When they entered the house, Taylor was inside. Brown sat in the living
room while the defendant and Taylor went to the back of the house and
talked. When asked why she did not try to leave when the defendant and
Taylor were in the back of the house, Brown replied, "It was nowhere to
go. I don't know. I just didn't." The defendant returned to the living
room area and turned on the television. He attempted to fix a broken
fan. Brown asked Taylor for a cigarette, and he gave her one.

 

\*403 The defendant began talking to Brown about another man she had
been seeing. By that time Taylor had gone out of the room and perhaps
the house. The defendant asked if Brown was "ready." The evidence tended
to show that she told him "no, that I wasn't going to bed with him." She
testified that she did not want to have sex with the defendant and did
not consent to do so at any time on June 15.

 

After Brown finished her cigarette, the defendant began kissing her
neck. He pulled her up from the chair in which she had been sitting and
started undressing her. He noticed that she was having her menstrual
period, and she sat down pulling her pants back up. The defendant again
took off her pants and blouse. He told her to \*\*473 lay down on a bed
which was in the living room. She complied and the defendant pushed
apart her legs and had sexual intercourse with her. Brown testified that
she did not try to push him away. She cried during the
intercourse[^136]. Afterwards they talked. The defendant told her he
wanted to make sure she was not lying about where she lived and that he
would not let her up unless she told him.

 

After they dressed they talked again about the man Brown had been
seeing. They left the house and went to the defendant's mother's house.
After talking with the defendant's mother, Brown took a bus home. She
talked with her mother about taking out a complaint against the
defendant but did not tell her mother she and the defendant had had sex.
Brown made a complaint to the police the same day.

 

The defendant continued to call Brown after June 15, but she refused to
see him. One evening he called from a telephone booth and told her he
had to talk. When he got to her apartment he threatened to kick her door
down and Brown let him inside[^137]. Once inside he said he had intended
merely to talk to her but that he wanted to make love again after seeing
her. Brown said she sat and looked at him, and that he began kissing
her. She pulled away and he picked her up and carried her to the
bedroom. He performed oral sex on her and she testified that she did not
try to fight him off because she found she enjoyed it. The two stayed
together until morning and had sexual intercourse several times that
night. Brown did not disclose the incident to the police immediately
because she said she was embarrassed.

 

\*404 The defendant put on no evidence and moved at the close of the
State's evidence for dismissal of both charges based on insufficiency of
evidence. The trial court denied the motions and the majority in the
Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court.

 

\[1\] \[2\] Upon the defendant's motion to dismiss, the question for the
court is whether substantial evidence was introduced of each element of
the offense charged and that the defendant was the perpetrator. [State
v. Earnhardt, 307 N.C. 62, 296 S.E.2d 649
(1982)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1982147901&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." [State v. Smith, 300
N.C. 71, 78--79, 265 S.E.2d 164, 169
(1980)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1980109921&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_169&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_169).
The issue of substantiality is a question of law for the court. If the
evidence is sufficient only to raise a suspicion or conjecture as to
either the commission of the offense or the identity of the perpetrator,
the motion to dismiss should be allowed. [State v. Cutler, 271 N.C. 379,
383, 156 S.E.2d 679, 682
(1967)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1967130779&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_682&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_682).
This is true even though the suspicion is strong. [State v. Evans, 279
N.C. 447, 183 S.E.2d 540
(1971)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1971128601&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).

 

**\...**

 

The defendant contends there was no substantial evidence that the sexual
intercourse between Brown and him was by force and against her will. He
argues that the evidence was insufficient to allow the trial court to
submit the issue of his guilt of second degree rape to the jury. After a
review of the evidence, we find this argument to have merit.

 

Second degree rape involves vaginal intercourse with the victim both by
force and against the victim's will. [G.S.
14--27.3](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000037&cite=NCSTS14-27.3&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
Consent by the victim is a complete defense, but consent which is
induced by fear of violence is void and is no legal consent. [State v.
Hall, 293 N.C. 559, 563, 238 S.E.2d 473, 476
(1977)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1977135422&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_476&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_476).

 

\[7\] A defendant can be guilty of raping even his mistress or a "common
strumpet." Cf. [State v. Long, 93 N.C. 542
(1885)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1885014536&pubNum=0000572&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default))
(assault with intent to rape). This is so because consent to sexual
intercourse freely given can be withdrawn at any time prior to
penetration. [State v. Way, 297 N.C. 293, 296, 254 S.E.2d 760, 761
(1979)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1979127288&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_761&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_761).
If the particular act of intercourse for which the defendant is charged
was both by force and against the victim's will, the offense is rape
without regard to the victim's consent given to the defendant for prior
acts of intercourse. Id.; R. Anderson, 1 Wharton's Criminal Law And
Procedure § 302 (1957).

 

Where as here the victim has engaged in a prior continuing consensual
sexual relationship with the defendant, however, determining the
victim's state of mind at the time of the alleged rape obviously is made
more difficult. Although inquiry in such cases still must be made into
the victim's state of mind at the time of the alleged rape, the State
ordinarily will be able to show  \*408 the victim's lack of consent to
the specific act charged only by evidence of statements or actions by
the victim which were clearly communicated to the defendant and which
expressly and unequivocally indicated the victim's withdrawal of any
prior consent and lack of consent to the particular act of intercourse.

 

\[8\] In the present case the State introduced such evidence. It is
true, of course, that Brown gave no physical resistance to the
defendant. Evidence of physical resistance is not necessary to prove
lack of consent in a rape case in this jurisdiction. [State v. Hall, 293
N.C. 559, 563, 238 S.E.2d 473, 476
(1977)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1977135422&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_711_476&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)#co_pp_sp_711_476).
Brown testified unequivocally that she did not consent to sexual
intercourse with the defendant on June 15. She was equally unequivocal
in testifying that she submitted to sexual intercourse with the
defendant only because she was afraid of him. During their walk, she
told the defendant that their relationship was at an end. When the
defendant asked her if she was "ready" immediately prior to having
sexual intercourse with her, she told him "no, that I wasn't going to
bed with him." Even in the absence of physical resistance by Brown, such
testimony by her provided substantial evidence that the act of sexual
intercourse was against her will. See, e.g., [State v. Arnold, 284 N.C.
41, 199 S.E.2d 423
(1973)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1973128086&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).

 

\*\*476 \[9\] The State did not offer substantial evidence, however, of
the element of force. As we have stated, actual physical force need not
be shown in order to establish force sufficient to constitute an element
of the crime of rape. Threats of serious bodily harm which reasonably
induce fear thereof are sufficient. See [State v. Burns, 287 N.C. 102,
214 S.E.2d
56,](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1975130684&pubNum=711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default))
cert. denied, [428 U.S. 933, 96 S.Ct. 288, 46 L.Ed.2d 264
(1975)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&pubNum=0000708&cite=96SCT288&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
In the present case there was no substantial evidence of either actual
or constructive force.

 

\[10\] The evidence in the present case tended to show that, shortly
after the defendant met Brown at the school, they walked out of the
parking lot with the defendant in front. He stopped and told Brown he
was going to "fix" her face so that her mother could see he was not
"playing." This threat by the defendant and his act of grabbing Brown by
the arm at the school, although they may have induced fear, appeared to
have been unrelated to the act of sexual intercourse between Brown and
the defendant. More important, the record is devoid of evidence that
Brown was in any way intimidated into having sexual intercourse with the
defendant \*409 by that threat or any other act of the defendant on June
15. Brown said she did not pay a lot of attention to what the defendant
said because she was thinking about other things. She specifically
stated that her fear of the defendant was based on an experience with
him prior to June 15 and that on June 15 he did not hold her down or
threaten her with what would happen if she refused to submit to him. The
State failed to offer substantial evidence of force used or threatened
by the defendant on June 15 which related to his desire to have sexual
intercourse on that date and was sufficient to overcome the will of the
victim.

 

We note that the absence of an explicit threat is not determinative in
considering whether there was sufficient force in whatever form to
overcome the will of the victim. It is enough if the totality of the
circumstances gives rise to a reasonable inference that the unspoken
purpose of the threat was to force the victim to submit to unwanted
sexual intercourse. [State v. Barnette, 304 N.C. 447, 284 S.E.2d 298
(1981)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1981150509&pubNum=0000711&originatingDoc=I0d994b1002e411da9439b076ef9ec4de&refType=RP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.History*oc.Default)).
The evidence introduced in the present case, however, gave rise to no
such inference. Under the peculiar facts of this case, there was no
substantial evidence that threats or force by the defendant on June 15
were sufficiently related to sexual conduct to cause Brown to believe
that she had to submit to sexual intercourse with him or suffer harm.
Although Brown's general fear of the defendant may have been justified
by his conduct on prior occasions, absent evidence that the defendant
used force or threats to overcome the will of the victim to resist the
sexual intercourse alleged to have been rape, such general fear was not
sufficient to show that the defendant used the force required to support
a conviction of rape.

 

In summary, we think that the State's evidence was sufficient to show
that the act of sexual intercourse in question was against Brown's will.
It was not sufficient, however, to show that the act was accomplished by
actual force or by a threat to use force unless she submitted to sexual
intercourse. Since the State did not introduce substantial evidence of
the element of force required to sustain a conviction of rape, the trial
court erred in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the case
against the defendant for second degree rape.

 

For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the opinion of the Court of
Appeals holding that there was no error in the defendant's \*410 trial
for second degree rape and remand this action to the Court of Appeals
for its further remand to the Superior Court, Durham County, for the
entry of directed verdicts in favor of the defendant.

Gonzalez raped her\.... The jury believed K.M. and found Gonzalez guilty

post-sentence motions, all of which the trial court denied\.... \[W\]e
affirm.

The trial court recounts the evidence adduced at trial as follows:5

 

The above convictions arose out of an incident that occurred on March 8,
2011. The victim was twenty-five years old at the time and suffers from
[cerebral
palsy](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ib778706e475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0).
Her [cerebral
palsy](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ib778706e475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)
causes her to have 'stiffness and tightening of the muscles' in her legs
and she needs crutches to walk. She testified that if she were lying on
the floor, she could pull herself up if she had something to pull
herself up on. When asked whether she could bend her knees normally, she
testified '\[n\]ot on my own. If I had to bend my knees, I would either
need to use my hands or have someone to help me.' When asked if she
could easily spread her legs apart, she responded, '\[n\]o,' and said
'\[t\]hey have to be pushed apart.' The victim also testified that 'I
can't \*717 spread my legs far enough to get \[a tampon\] in,' and has
to use pads during her period.6

The victim and \[Gonzalez\] met each other on a Christian dating website
in August 2010. They met in person in September of that year, but
\[Gonzalez\] soon left the area to pursue a position as a youth minister
in New York. They reestablished a relationship when he returned in
December 2010, and began seeing each other. On March 7, 2011,
\[Gonzalez\] picked up the victim and took her to the mall. They
discussed their religious beliefs, and the victim testified that 'I had
told \[Gonzalez\] that I was a virgin and didn't plan on having sex
before I was married.' She further testified that he responded by saying
'something along the lines \... of praise the Lord.' She also said that
he told her he was not a virgin. That evening, they kissed and hugged.
The victim also testified that \[Gonzalez\] asked her to be his
girlfriend, and she agreed7.

On March 8, 2011, \[Gonzalez\] picked up the victim from her physical
therapy appointment around 2:30 p.m. They stopped to get food and went
to \[Gonzalez\]'s apartment to watch a movie. This was the first time
the victim had been to \[Gonzalez\]'s apartment. They sat down on the
couch and began watching the movie. The victim testified that she
started kissing \[Gonzalez\] and they both began touching and rubbing
one another's genitals over their clothes. This lasted for about half an
hour. Eventually, the victim noticed that \[Gonzalez\] was erect. Next,
the victim testified that \[Gonzalez\] asked her if she wanted to go to
the bedroom, to which she agreed. The victim 'assumed that we would
continue doing what we were doing in the living room in the bedroom \...
\[b\]ecause \... \[Gonzalez\] knew that I didn't want to have sex before
I was married.' Before they moved, the victim testified that
\[Gonzalez\] took her phone out of a pouch connected to her jeans and
placed it on a TV tray in the living room. The victim then got her
crutches, got off the couch, and walked to \[Gonzalez\]'s bedroom. Once
in the bedroom, she noticed a bare mattress against the wall with no
furniture surrounding it. \[Gonzalez\] then either helped her sit on the
mattress or she sat down herself. The victim testified that \[Gonzalez\]
'took my crutches \[and\] put them out of reach. I didn't see exactly
where he put them. But I know it was out of reach.' The victim lay down
by herself. When asked 'is there any way you could have gotten up from
that point?' She responded 'no.'8

The victim testified that \[Gonzalez\] then removed her jeans and
underwear, and lay on top of her. The victim did not say anything while
\[Gonzalez\] took off her pants and underwear, but when he lay on top of
her, she said 'no, don't.' When he lay on top of her, her legs were
flat, straight, and unopened because 'I can't open my legs by myself.'9

Next, the victim testified that \[Gonzalez\] \... forced her legs apart
'with his hands and put them on his shoulders. And he had his hands
cuffed around my ankles.' She testified that '\[h\]e put my ankles
around his shoulders.' 'He bent \[her knees\] because they were up on
his shoulders.' She then felt his penis inside her, and \*718 she 'kept
saying ow.' \[Gonzalez\] told the victim she 'had to be quiet.' The
victim was asked if she tried at all to kick off \[Gonzalez\] during the
penetration. She responded, 'I couldn't move my legs. My legs don't move
like that.' When asked if she tried to push him off, she said, '\[n\]o
\... because he's too big. And I was scared.'10

At some point, \[Gonzalez\] suddenly stopped, and the encounter ended.
There was blood on the mattress and blood on the victim's underwear
after she put them back on. The victim testified that after she got
dressed, \[Gonzalez\] said to her, 'I'm sorry. I have a weakness.'11

During cross-examination, defense counsel inquired into the victim's
mobility. The victim attended Lancaster Bible College and when asked if
she could walk around the campus independently, she responded, 'with
crutches, yes.' The victim later testified on redirect that she has
'people to help me carry' books and things, and she needs assistance to
open doors.

\...

Furthermore, when asked if she had any bruises from the incident the
victim responded: 'No, I don't think I did.' The victim also testified
that \[Gonzalez\] did not hit, kick, grab, push, gag, or punch her or
use his fists or a weapon. Defense counsel asked why the victim and
\[Gonzalez\] moved to the bedroom when they were already making out in
the living room. The victim responded, 'there was no purpose. I didn't
think I was in any danger with David. I saw him---I thought he was an
honest person.' Defense counsel asked, 'So for the record, it never
crossed your mind that at that point, you were moving to the bedroom for
sex. It never crossed your mind?' The victim responded, 'No, ma'am.'12

 

After concluding sexual intercourse, K.M. and Gonzalez returned to the
living room to continue watching the movie. Gonzalez indicated that his
cousin was coming over to visit, and K.M. asked him to take her home.
Gonzalez assisted her, and \... Gonzalez went to get his car. Although
the police station was across the street, K.M. did not make any
telephone calls or attempt to go to the police station to report the
incident. Gonzalez helped K.M. into the car, and they stopped at a gas
station en route to her house. She did not use her cell phone at the gas
station or report the incident to anyone. Upon arriving at her home,
Gonzalez helped her get out of the car.15

 

After K.M. entered her house, her sister asked her whether something was
wrong\.... K.M. initially denied that anything was wrong but then
stated: "I think he raped me."16

\...

 

\[1\] \[2\] \[3\] Gonzalez' first argument on appeal is a challenge to
the sufficiency of the evidence. We first consider the evidence of rape.
The Crimes Code defines rape in pertinent part as follows: "A person
commits a felony of the first degree when the person engages in sexual
intercourse with a complainant \... by forcible compulsion." [18 Pa.C.S.
§
3121(a)(1)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000262&cite=PA18S3121&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_7b9b000044381).
The Crimes Code defines "forcible compulsion" in relevant part as
"compulsion by use of physical, intellectual, moral, emotional or
psychological force, either express or implied." [18 Pa.C.S. §
3101](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000262&cite=PA18S3101&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=LQ&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).
This Court has observed "forcible compulsion" as the exercise of sheer
physical force or violence and has also come to mean an act of using
superior force, physical, moral, psychological or intellectual to compel
a person to do a thing against that person's volition and/or will. \*721
[Commonwealth v. Ables, 404 Pa.Super. 169, 590 A.2d 334, 337
(1991)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1991083960&pubNum=0000162&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_162_337&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_162_337).
A determination of forcible compulsion rests on the totality of the
circumstances, including but not limited to this list of factors:

the respective ages of the victim and the accused, the respective mental
and physical conditions of the victim and the accused, the atmosphere
and physical setting in which the incident was alleged to have taken
place, the extent to which the accused may have been in a position of
authority, domination or custodial control over the victim, and whether
the victim was under duress.

[Commonwealth v. Rhodes, 510 Pa. 537, 510 A.2d 1217, 1226
(1986)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1986129951&pubNum=0000162&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_162_1226&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_162_1226)
(emphasis added). It is not mandatory to show that the victim resisted
the assault in order to prove forcible compulsion. Id. The victim's
uncorroborated testimony is sufficient to support a rape conviction.
[Commonwealth v. Wall, 953 A.2d 581, 584
(Pa.Super.2008)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2016500765&pubNum=0000162&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_162_584&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_162_584).

 

\[4\] The distinction between forcible compulsion and lack of consent is
important to remember. With regard to consent, the Crimes Code states:
"The consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense
or to the result thereof is a defense if such consent negatives an
element of the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil
sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense." [18 Pa.C.S. §
311(a)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000262&cite=PA18S311&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=SP&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_8b3b0000958a4).
"Forcible compulsion" means "something more" than mere lack of consent.
[Commonwealth v. Smolko, 446 Pa.Super. 156, 666 A.2d 672, 676
(1995)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1995202308&pubNum=0000162&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_162_676&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_162_676).
"Where there is a lack of consent, but no showing of either physical
force, a threat of physical force, or psychological coercion, the
'forcible compulsion' requirement \... is not met." Id.

 

\[5\] The trial court comprehensively analyzed the sufficiency of the
evidence of rape \... denying Gonzalez's motion for post-trial relief.
The court aptly described this case as "unique", because "it is not a
case of moral, psychological, or intellectual forcible compulsion that
has often been found in circumstances involving a young, vulnerable
victim and a perpetrator who is in a position of authority and trust."
Opinion Denying Post--Trial Relief ("Post--Trial Opinion"), 11/5/13, p.
13. The court was careful to note that this case involved "two competent
adults who formed a dating relationship" who had engaged in "some
consensual intimacy (i.e. kissing, hugging)", and the incident "occurred
during a planned date." Id., p. 14. Moreover, "the victim initiated
kissing and touching with \[Gonzalez\] on the couch in his living room,
willingly walked herself to the bedroom upon \[Gonzalez's\] request, and
did not protest when he removed her pants and underwear." Id. Thus, the
court found nothing about the respective ages or mental conditions of
Gonzalez and K.M. that demonstrates forcible compulsion. Id. Gonzalez
did not occupy a position of "authority or custodial control" over K.M.,
and she was not under duress. Id.

 

Despite these factors, the trial court reasoned that other details
showed Gonzalez's "domination" over K.M. The court observed that K.M.'s
[cerebral
palsy](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ib778706e475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0)
"was a physical condition that caused her to have stiff legs with
limited movement and walk with crutches." Id., p. 16. During the
encounter, "she was lying on her back, away from her crutches and her
cell phone," all of which Gonzalez had placed beyond her reach, and she
"was away from any objects she could use to help lift herself up \..."
Id. Gonzalez "was initially lying on top of her and then forced her legs
apart and cuffed her ankles on his shoulders. He also told \[K.M.\] to
be quiet when she repeatedly said 'ow' during the penetration." Id.
Although K.M. did not call out for help or try to push Gonzalez away
with her arms, "resistance is not \*722 necessary to prove forcible
compulsion"---and in any event, resistance would have accomplished
nothing, since Gonzalez was too big to push off her body, and she was
unable to kick due to her [cerebral
palsy](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ib778706e475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0).
Id., pp. 16--17.

 

The trial court also concluded that there was evidence of "physical
force." By itself, K.M.'s statement, "no don't", is not sufficient
evidence of force, because this statement only indicates lack of
consent, and "forcible compulsion is something more than lack of
consent." Id. at 17 (citing [Commonwealth v. Berkowitz, 537 Pa. 143, 641
A.2d 1161, 1165
(1994)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1994118636&pubNum=0000162&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_162_1165&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_162_1165)).
Here, however, there was "something more," specifically, lack of consent
and physical force:

\[Gonzalez\] forc\[ed\] the victim's legs apart, ben\[t\] her knees,
mov\[ed\] her ankles up to his shoulders and cuff\[ed\] her ankles while
he penetrated her. The victim was unable to open her legs or bend her
knees by herself. \[Gonzalez\] repositioned her legs when he penetrated
her with his finger, and then again placed her legs back on his
shoulders when he penetrated her with his penis a second time. Again,
the victim was unable to move her legs to resist or prevent
\[Gonzalez's\] actions.

Id., p. 17. Although this force "was not extreme, it was certainly
unique to the factual circumstances of the case and sufficient to
establish forcible compulsion by \[Gonzalez\] on this particular victim"
beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., pp. 17--18.

 

\[6\] We agree with the trial court's astute analysis by construing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. K.M.'s
testimony establishes that she told Gonzalez that she did not want
premarital intercourse. Gonzalez pretended to agree with K.M., but one
day later, he maneuvered her into a position in which she was powerless
to resist his advances. He took her to his apartment, where she had
never been before. He placed her cell phone out of reach in a living
room tray, and when they adjourned to his bedroom and lay down on his
bed, he placed her crutches out of reach. Without her phone or crutches,
she could not escape from the bed or contact an outside agency for help.
He then disrobed her and lay on top of her. She uttered "no, don't," but
instead of stopping, he forced her legs apart and cuffed them on his
shoulders---movements she was incapable of performing herself due to her
[cerebral
palsy](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?entityType=disease&entityId=Ib778706e475411db9765f9243f53508a&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0).
He then penetrated her with his penis and told her to be quiet when she
repeatedly called out "ow". K.M.'s lack of consent ("no, don't"),
combined with Gonzalez's use of domination and physical force, provide
sufficient evidence of forcible compulsion to justify his conviction for
rape.

\...

In his final argument on appeal, Gonzalez insists that his sentence is
unreasonable and excessive.

 

\[38\] \[39\] This is a challenge to the discretionary aspects of
Gonzalez's sentence. Our standard of review is as follows:

Sentencing is a matter vested in the sound discretion of the sentencing
judge, and a sentence will not be disturbed on appeal absent a manifest
abuse of discretion. In this context, an abuse of discretion is not
shown merely by an error in judgment. Rather, the appellant must
establish, by reference to the record, that the sentencing court ignored
or misapplied the law, exercised its judgment for reasons of partiality,
prejudice, bias or ill will, or arrived at a manifestly unreasonable
decision.

\[42\] Here, Gonzalez timely filed his notice of appeal \... after the
trial court denied his post-sentence motions. [Pa.R.Crim.P.

statement in his brief\.... The substantial question in Gonzalez's brief
is an "excessive sentence claim\[ \] in conjunction with an assertion
that the court did not consider mitigating factors." [Commonwealth v.
Dodge, 77 A.3d 1263, 1272
(Pa.Super.2013)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2031527252&pubNum=0007691&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_7691_1272&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_7691_1272)
(en banc ).38

 

\*732 \[43\] We determine, however, that Gonzalez's excessiveness claim
is devoid of merit. We find persuasive the trial court's thorough
analysis of this question:

\[Gonzalez\] argues that the Court failed to properly weigh\[ \] certain
mitigating circumstances, including his law abiding past, his education,
his employment history, his community and familial support, and the fact
that this was his first conviction. The Court disagrees as this argument
is contradicted by the record. First, a pre-sentence investigation
report was prepared by the Probation Department, and our Supreme Court
has stated that, '\[w\]here pre-sentence reports exist, we shall
continue to presume that the sentencing judge was aware of relevant
information regarding \[Gonzalez\]'s character and weighed those
considerations along with mitigating statutory factors.' [Commonwealth
v. Devers \[519 Pa. 88\], 546 A.2d 12, 18
(Pa.1988)](http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1988099154&pubNum=0000162&originatingDoc=I06469857a1cb11e4a807ad48145ed9f1&refType=RP&fi=co_pp_sp_162_18&originationContext=document&vr=3.0&rs=cblt1.0&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_pp_sp_162_18).
Not only did the Court thoroughly review \[Gonzalez\]'s pre-sentence
investigation report, but also considered \[Gonzalez\]'s twenty-four
letters of support, heard and considered the individuals who came forth
to support \[Gonzalez\] at sentencing, and heard what his attorney
stated on his behalf. See N.T. 12/18/2013 p. 41. Acknowledging this
information, the Court stated, '\[t\]he witnesses that have testified in
your support and the letters provided for those who are absent today all
attest to your good moral character, your commitment to the community in
general, and to your church.' Id. The Court stated further:

Notwithstanding the uncontested good deeds that are attested to in these
documents relative to your community, the issue alone is not whether you
are viewed as an upstanding contributing member of society. The focus
today must be on what you did do to this victim on March 8th of 2011 and
how should you be held accountable for your behavior on that day.

Id. at 41--42. Despite \[Gonzalez\]'s contentions otherwise, the Court
did in fact consider and weigh mitigating factors, yet found them of
lesser value when considering the gravity of \[Gonzalez\]'s crimes
against the victim. Additionally, at the time of sentencing,
\[Gonzalez\] still refused to 'acknowledge wrongdoing or the pain of the
victim.' Id. at 42. Such lack of remorse and accountability weighed
heavily in the Court's sentencing decisions and weighed against the
mitigating factors \[Gonzalez\] claims the Court failed to consider. The
Court reasoned that \[Gonzalez\]'s 'choice to not express remorse for
the victim's consequences of that day limits the value of the character
witnesses letters and testimony provided today such that I can consider
them in shaping the sentence. But they cannot be viewed as an excuse for
your behavior.' Id.

 

Judgment of sentence affirmed.

Notes and Questions for Commonwealth v. Gonzalez

 

**Follow-up discussion: *Commonwealth v. Gonzalez***

1.  In 2005, the Supreme Court of Kansas ruled a statute
    unconstitutional for violating the equal protection provisions of
    the United States and Kansas Constitutions. The statute allowed a
    less harsh punishment for unlawful voluntary sexual conduct between
    members of the *opposite* sex compared to the harsher punishment for
    the same conduct between members of the *same* sex. In the ruling,
    the Court struck the words \"and are members of the opposite sex\"
    from the statute, taking a step toward equality in sentencing for
    sexual assault. See State v. Limon, 280 Kan. 275, 276, 122 P.3d 22,
    24 (2005).

2.  [Barriers to Reporting Sexual Violence in LGBTQ
    Communities](https://www.rainn.org/news/barriers-reporting-sexual-violence-lgbtq-communities)

3.  Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century British Chief Justice, theorized
    that wives give "irrevocable consent" to their husband and in this
    "mutual matrimonial consent and contract, the wife hath given up
    herself in this kind unto her husband which she cannot retract." 
    This ideology was adopted into American culture and served as the
    foundation for the marital rape exemption, which precluded a state
    from charging a husband with the crime of rape of his wife.

As of 2019, according to data from the [National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence
(NCADV)](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/11/deval-patrick-spousal-rape-laws/),
between 10 and 14% of married women will experience marital rape. Yet to
this day, many states still uphold the marital rape exemption. For
example, in 17 states "a spouse can\'t be convicted of raping a partner
who was unconscious, drugged, or otherwise incapacitated."

4.     The origins of the marital rape exemption are rooted in the
outdated concept that wives were the property of their husbands. Despite
this antiquated notion, the exemption has had a long life, "thriving
through the 'sexual revolution' of the 1960s and 1970s without change."
In fact, the "1980 Model Penal Code extended this exemption to all
persons living together as 'man and wife.'"

The arguments for keeping the marital rape exemption included: (a)
keeping the marital relationship private, (b) protecting husbands from
vindictive wives, (c) it is nearly impossible to prove, and (d) a charge
of rape would discourage reconciliation between husband and wife. 

In the 1980s, these arguments were finally addressed during one of the
landmark cases of marital rape. In People v. Liberta , a husband, who
was living apart from his wife under court order, raped and sodomized
his wife in front of their 2-year old son. He was convicted at trial,
after the court ruled that the court order had rendered him \"not
married.\" The husband appealed the ruling, claiming that the court
order did not declare him not married,\" and therefore he should retain
the protection of the \[marital rape\] exemption. In upholding his
conviction, New York\'s highest court struck down the marital rape
exemption as an unconstitutional denial of equal protection for married
women.

In rendering this judgment, the NY Court of Appeals made it clear that:
(a) marital privacy is meant to provide privacy of acts that both
husband and wife find agreeable; it is not meant to shield abuse; (b)
labeling all wives potentially vindictive is a poor stereotype not
supported by any evidence; (c) many crimes without witnesses are hard to
prove, yet this is no reason for making a crime \"unprosecutable;\" and
(d) making rape in marriage a crime does not make marriage more
difficult; it is rather a rape which would make a marriage more
difficult."  See People v. Liberta, 64 N.Y.2d 152, 474 N.E.2d 567 (1984)

McQuirter v. State

 

[The Story of Carolyn Bryant, the White Woman Whose Lie Caused the
Murder of Emmett Till](https://allthatsinteresting.com/carolyn-bryant)

"Carolyn Bryant's alleged confession highlights a horrific recurrence of
white women weaponizing lies against black men that still persists
today."

"As recent as May 2020, a video of a white woman named Amy Cooper went
viral when she feigned hysteria and claimed to police that she was being
threatened by a black man named Christian Cooper. Fortunately, with a
video recording, the man was able to document the disturbing lie."

This article, originally published by All That's Interesting in January
2017 and updated in June of this year, addresses the history of white
women weaponizing lies against Black men knowing it will cost them their
lives and the climate of violent displays of racism that still shapes
the legal system today through Emmet Till's story. Our group thought to
include this article as a note to McQuirter v. State (1953). The court
in McQuirter held that, "In determining the question of intention the
jury may consider social conditions and customs founded upon racial
differences, such as that the prosecutrix was a white woman and
defendant was a Negro man." We agreed that in order to address the
intersection race and rape law, this opinion must be read in conjunction
with a supplement that addresses the events that lead up to Emmett
Till's death in 1955.

3 Div. 947

1953-02-17

63 So.2d 388 (1953)

### McQUIRTER v. STATE.

3 Div. 947.

Court of Appeals of Alabama.

February 17, 1953.

Windell C. Owens, Monroeville, for appellant.

Si Garrett, Atty. Gen., and Maury D. Smith, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the
State.

PRICE, Judge.

Appellant, a Negro man, was found guilty of an attempt to commit an
assault with intent to rape, under an indictment charging an assault
with intent to rape. The jury assessed a fine of \$500.

\[389\] About 8:00 o\'clock on the night of June 29, 1951, Mrs. Ted
Allen, a white woman, with her two children and a neighbor\'s little
girl, were drinking Coca-Cola at the \"Tiny Diner\" in Atmore. When they
started in the direction of Mrs. Allen\'s home she noticed appellant
sitting in the cab of a parked truck. As she passed the truck appellant
said something unintelligible, opened the truck door and placed his foot
on the running board.

Mrs. Allen testified appellant followed her down the street and when she
reached Suell Lufkin\'s house she stopped. As she turned into the Lufkin
house appellant was within two or three feet of her. She waited ten
minutes for appellant to pass. When she proceeded on her way, appellant
came toward her from behind a telephone pole. She told the children to
run to Mr. Simmons\' house and tell him to come and meet her. When
appellant saw Mr. Simmons he turned and went back down the street to the
intersection and leaned on a stop sign just across the street from Mrs.
Allen\'s home. Mrs. Allen watched him at the sign from Mr. Simmons\'
porch for about thirty minutes, after which time he came back down the
street and appellant went on home.

Mrs. Allen\'s testimony was corroborated by that of her young daughter.
The daughter testified the appellant was within six feet of her mother
as she approached the Lufkin house, and this witness said there was a
while when she didn\'t see appellant at the intersection.

Mr. Lewis Simmons testified when the little girls ran up on his porch
and said a Negro was after them, witness walked up the sidewalk to meet
Mrs. Allen and saw appellant. Appellant went on down the street and
stopped in front of Mrs. Allen\'s home and waited there approximately
thirty minutes.

Mr. Clarence Bryars, a policeman in Atmore, testified that appellant
stated after his arrest that he came to Atmore with the intention of
getting him a white woman that night.

Mr. W. E. Strickland, Chief of Police of Atmore, testified that
appellant stated in the Atmore jail he didn\'t know what was the matter
with him; that he was drinking a little; that he and his partner had
been to Pensacola; that his partner went to the \"Front\" to see a
colored woman; that he didn\'t have any money and he sat in the truck
and made up his mind he was going to get the first woman that came by
and that this was the first woman that came by. He said he got out of
the truck, came around the gas tank and watched the lady and when she
started off he started off behind her; that he was going to carry her in
the cotton patch and if she hollered he was going to kill her. He
testified appellant made the same statement in the Brewton jail.

Mr. Norvelle Seals, Chief Deputy Sheriff, corroborated Mr. Strickland\'s
testimony as to the statement by appellant at the Brewton jail.

Appellant, as a witness in his own behalf, testified he and Bill Page,
another Negro, carried a load of junk-iron from Monroeville to
Pensacola; on their way back to Monroeville they stopped in Atmore. They
parked the truck near the \"Tiny Diner\" and rode to the \"Front,\" the
colored section, in a cab. Appellant came back to the truck around 8:00
o\'clock and sat in the truck cab for about thirty minutes. He decided
to go back to the \"Front\" to look for Bill Page. As he started up the
street he saw prosecutrix and her children. He turned around and waited
until he decided they had gone, then he walked up the street toward the
\"Front.\" When he reached the intersection at the telegraph pole he
decided he didn\'t want to go to the \"Front\" and sat around there a
few minutes, then went on to the \"Front\" and stayed about 25 or 30
minutes, and came back to the truck.

He denied that he followed Mrs. Allen or made any gesture toward
molesting her or the children. He denied making the statements testified
to by the officers.

He testified he had never been arrested before and introduced testimony
by two residents of Monroeville as to his good reputation for peace and
quiet and for truth and veracity.

\[390\] Appellant insists the trial court erred in refusing the general
affirmative charge and in denying the motion for a new trial on the
ground the verdict was contrary to the evidence.

\"\`An attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape,\' \* \* \*
means an attempt to rape which has not proceeded far enough to amount to
an assault\". Burton v. State, 8 Ala.App. 295, 62 So. 394, 396.

Under the authorities in this state, to justify a conviction for an
attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to have
sexual intercourse with prosecutrix against her will, by force or by
putting her in fear. Morris v. State, 32 Ala.App. 278, 25 So.2d 54;
Burton v. State, 8 Ala.App. 295, 62 So. 394.

Intent is a question to be determined by the jury from the facts and
circumstances adduced on the trial, and if there is evidence from which
it may be inferred that at the time of the attempt defendant intended to
gratify his lustful desires against the resistance of the female a jury
question is presented. McCluskey v. State, 35 Ala.App. 456, 48 So.2d 68.

In determining the question of intention the jury may consider social
conditions and customs founded upon racial differences, such as that the
prosecutrix was a white woman and defendant was a Negro man. Pumphrey v.
State, 156 Ala. 103, 47 So. 156; Kelly v. State, 1 Ala.App. 133, 56 So.
15.

After considering the evidence in this case we are of the opinion it was
sufficient to warrant the submission of the question of defendant\'s
guilt to the jury, and was ample to sustain the judgment of conviction.

Defense counsel contends in brief that the testimony of the officers as
to defendant\'s declarations of intent was inadmissible because no
attempt or overt act toward carrying that intent into effect had been
proven.

Defendant\'s grounds of objection to this evidence were that it was
\"irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial.\" Proper predicates were laid
for the introduction of each of said statements. In the absence of a
ground of objection calling the court\'s attention to the fact that the
corpus delicti has not been sufficiently proven to authorize admission
of a confession such question cannot be reviewed here. Edgil v. State,
Ala.App., 56 So.2d 677 and authorities there cited.

Moreover, if any facts are proven from which the jury may reasonably
infer that the crime has been committed proof of the confession is
rendered admissible. Rutland v. State, 31 Ala.App. 43, 11 So.2d 768;
Ratliff v. State, 212 Ala. 410, 102 So. 621; Hill v. State, 207 Ala.
444, 93 So. 460.

We find no reversible error in the record and the judgment of the trial
court is affirmed.

Affirmed.

You Want a Confederate Monument? My Body is a Confederate Monument

 

<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/confederate-monuments-racism.html>

 

"I am a black, Southern woman, and of my immediate white male ancestors,
all of them were rapists. My very existence is a relic of slavery and
Jim Crow."

"Among the apologists for the Southern cause and for its monuments,
there are those who dismiss the hardships of the past\...To those people
it is my privilege to say, I am proof. I am proof that whatever else the
South might have been, or might believe itself to be, it was and is a
space whose prosperity and sense of romance and nostalgia were built
upon the grievous exploitation of black life."

This article, written by journalist and poet Caroline Randall Williams,
addresses the sentiment of those who want to remember the legacy of the
Confederacy and who oppose the removal of Confederate monuments across
the country within the context of plantation rape. Williams brilliantly
denounces the need for manufactured monuments commemorating the Old
South because, she writes, her very being is enough of a standing memory
of slavery. She uses the phrase "rape-colored skin" and means it
literally because she comes from black people who were owned and raped
by the white people she comes from. Williams writes this article amidst
the criticism of Black Lives Matter protestors who are calling for
and/or bringing down Confederate monuments all around the country. Our
group agreed this article is incredibly powerful because in offering up
her body as a testament to why these monuments must come down, Williams
forces the reader to confront this country's emotional investment in the
inferiorization and exploitation of black people and black women.

My Rapist Apologized

 

<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/opinion/abortion-legislation-rape.html>

 

"Without even realizing it, I had forgiven him. It's difficult to
imagine that I would feel the same if he had shown me no care or
concern, or if I had been forced to endure a fresh wave of trauma in our
court system, or if I had been forced to give birth to a child that I
did not choose."

This article, written by Michelle Alexander, captures a conversation
Alexander had with her daughter in which she tells her that she was
raped while attending law school at Stanford, that she became pregnant,
and that because she had a choice, she decided to have an abortion.
Alexander writes this article in response to her daughter inquiring
about her opinion on abortion. Our group found this piece to be thought
provoking and painfully honest. Alexander addresses the nuances of
aborition in the context of 1) the alarmingly high statistical
likelihood that a woman will be raped at some point in her lifetime (1
in 5 according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center at the
time the article was written), 2) her apprehension to report what
happened to her because she believed our court system would only
retraumatize her 3) the intergenerational wealth gap between black and
white families that plays a large role in why Black women have the
highest rates of abortion, and 4) her belief that true gender and racial
equality will only be achieved when all women have the right to make
decisions about our own bodies.

She Didn\'t Act Like a Rape Victim

 

<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/opinion/armed-forces-rape.html>

 

"Our rapes were on us, the Army was telling us, and neither I, nor the
specialist, nor this staff sergeant acted enough "like a rape victim," a
mantra often repeated by the investigators in my own case\...Despite my
own visible, documented injuries, I didn't cry hard enough, loud enough,
in the military police station in the hours after my rape, in front of a
group of men who had no intention of believing me anyway."

"When we stay silent to protect ourselves, we perpetuate our own
isolation. We are a sea of women, and yet we make islands out of each
other. Something has got to break, and it shouldn't be us anymore."

This article was written in response to three judges on the Army Appeals
Court overturning a rape convition. Their argument: the sex must have
been consensual because the alleged rapist (Cadet Jacob D. Whisenhunt)
"made no effort to avoid being detected" and behaved as if he had
nothing to hide. Women in the army often do not report their rape or
sexual assault because they 1) do not want to jeapordize their job or
security clearance 2) fear retaliation and/or 3) accept it as part of
the workplace culture. "Every rape in the Army is unreal, unbelievable
--- but only because we already know that almost no one will believe
\[the victim\]. It's easier not to." If a victim didn't yell, he/she
must have wanted it, because rape victims "must yell, cry and fight."
But even for those who do fight back and have the bruises to prove it,
there is almost no reason to report the rape/ sexual assault to a "group
of men who have no intention of believing" the victim. Cadet Jacob D.
Whisenhunt did not have reason to fear; he did not have reason to hide.
His actions say nothing about his guilt or innocence, but his confidence
certainly speaks volumes about the how the army handles rape and sexual
assault allegations.

I Went on a Date with Aziz Ansari. It Turned Out to be the Worst Night
of my Life

 

<https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355>

 

"Grace compares Ansari's sexual mannerisms to those of a horny, rough,
entitled 18-year-old. She said so to her friends via text after the date
and said the same thing to me when we spoke."

"But Aziz Ansari isn't an 18-year-old. He's a 34-year-old actor and
comedian of global renown who's probably done more thinking about the
nuances of dating and sex in the digital age than practically anyone
else. He wrote a book about it, "Modern Romance", and it was a New York
Times bestseller. Ansari built his career on being cute and nice and
parsing the signals women send to men and the male emotions that result
and turning them into award-winning, Madison Square Garden-filling
comedy."

This is the story of one woman (pseudonymously named "Grace") who
describes an unwanted sexual encounter with Ansari after going home with
him one night after a date. Although the facts of what happened that
night are cringeworthy, our group thought it provided valuable insight
to the rape culture that persists in this country. The article
illustrates Grace's awareness of Ansari's coercive behavior, his failure
to obtain affirmative consent throughout the sexual encounter, and her
inability to decide, afterwards, how to think about the encounter: had
she been assaulted or was it just really bad, sloppy sex. The article
reminded our group of the extent to which sexual coercion persists, even
among adults, and even when the alleged perpetrator is a self-proclaimed
male feminist, who proclaims that he, "gets it."

[This

covers the piece of legislation signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 in
response to the months of public outrage over the six-month sentence for
sexual assault given to Brock Turner. The bill essentially expanded the
legal definition of rape and imposed new mandatory minimum sentences on
some sexual assault offenders. Our group thought it would be appropriate
at some point to discuss the criminal process that further complicates
rape/sexual assault cases such as 1) statute of limitations for
specified sex crimes, 2) varying legal definitions of rape, and 3)
sentencing for sex assault crimes in context of Brock Turner case.

Defenses

 

In the next few sections, we will explore situations in which the
commission of what might otherwise be a crime does not result in
punishment. Broadly speaking, the doctrines in this area of criminal law
are grouped into "justification" and "excuse." In this section, we will
discuss the first kind of justification: self-defense. Self-defense
justifies a crime---more than excusing it, it affirms that what would
otherwise be a criminal act is in fact desirable in a given situation.
In cases of legal self-defense, our system treats a person who kills or
injures as morally right, even when they kill intentionally. Legalizing
assault, killing, or other forceful actions inevitably devolves the
state's usual monopoly on the legitimate use of force, to individual
persons capable of abusing it. Thus, legal self-defense raises several
concerns. Should self-defense be a last resort? Must the defender
respond with minimal force, or is any amount of force legitimate? Must
the threat be actual, subjective, or objectively reasonable? Different
jurisdictions have created different systems. Compare the questions
raised by situations such as ongoing abusive domestic relationships or
an encounter with a stranger on the subway. As you read the following
cases, consider the criminal system's difficulty in managing
individuals' legal use of force, and notice how the law attempts to
channel and contain that Pandora's box.

Paul H. Robinson---Criminal Law Defenses: A Systematic Analysis

 

82 Columbia Law Review 199 (1982), 200, 202--05, 208--11, 213--14, 221,
229--32.

 

Unlike many aspects of the criminal law, defenses have not yet been the
subject of comprehensive conceptual analysis. The general nature and
scope of most defenses have been perpetuated for centuries with little
or no question. Current debates commonly focus on whether a particular
defense should apply in a particular circumstance, but rarely consider
the larger perspective. How do circumstances covered by one defense
compare with those of other defenses? Do defenses overlap? If so, will
the outcome in identical situations vary with the defense asserted?
Should it? Are there gaps between defenses, that is, circumstances in
which our common sense of justice suggests that the defendant should be
exculpated, yet where no defense applies? Do defenses based on
theoretically analogous grounds of exculpation generate analogous
results? The general inquiry, which seems never to have been undertaken,
is: how does the collection of recognized defenses operate as a system?
\* \* \*

There are, no doubt, many people who believe that defenses defy such
systemization. Defenses, it might be argued, are the embodiment of such
complex human notions of fairness and morality, tempered by the demands
of utility and efficiency, that they are too complex and perhaps too
illogical to be reduced to an integrated, comprehensive, and internally
consistent system of exculpation. \* \* \* 

This Article attempts to provide some measure of conceptual organization
for criminal law defenses \* \* \*.

1.  A System of Defenses

The term "defense" is commonly used, at least in a casual sense, to mean
any set of identifiable conditions or circumstances which may prevent a
conviction for an offense. \* \* \* Upon examining the functions of and
the rationales supporting these rules and doctrines, five general
categories become apparent. They may be termed: failure of proof
defenses, offense modification defenses, justifications, excuses, and
nonexculpatory public policy defenses. \* \* \*

1.  Failure of Proof Defenses

Failure of proof defenses consist of instances in which, because of the
conditions that are the basis for the "defense," all elements of the
offense charged cannot be proven. They are in essence no more than the
negation of an element required by the definition of the offense. \* \*
\* 

Mistake provides a clear example \* \* \*. Assume, for example, that
incest is defined as having intercourse with a person the actor knows to
be an ancestor, descendant, or sibling. If the actor honestly believes
that the person with whom he is having intercourse is not a relative,
one might term his mistake a "defense." In reality, the actor's mistaken
belief prevents a state from proving the required mental element of
knowledge of the familial relationship. When this sort of mistake of
fact is recognized as a "defense," it is considered not a general
mistake excuse, but only a failure of proof defense. \* \* \*

2.  Offense Modifications

Offense-modification defenses are real defenses in the sense that they
do more than simply negate an element of an offense. They apply even
where all elements of the offense are satisfied. They are
distinguishable from general defenses (like self-defense or insanity),
however, because they introduce criminalization decisions similar to
those used in defining offenses, rather than giving effect to general
principles of exculpation. They provide a more sophisticated account,
when needed, of the harm or evil sought to be prohibited by the
definition of the offense.

A parent, against the advice of police, pays a \$10,000 ransom to the
kidnapper of his child. A businessman pays monthly extortion payments to
a racketeer. These persons may well satisfy the elements required for
complicity in kidnapping and extortion, yet they will nonetheless have a
defense to these charges. \* \* \*

There is a single principle behind these modifications of the definition
of an offense: while the actor has apparently satisfied all elements of
the offense charged, he has not in fact caused the harm or evil sought
to be prevented by the statute defining the offense. \* \* \*

In many cases the defenses of this group are given no formal name, but
exist only as accepted rules. For example, with regard to the kidnapping
and extortion examples above, a common rule provides that the victim of
a crime may not be held as an accomplice even though his conduct has in
a significant sense aided the commission of the crime. \* \* \*

 Some offense modifications are considered defenses, rather than simply
rules or doctrines, but they operate similarly to modify the definition
of offenses. \* \* \*

Offense modifications, like failure of proof defenses, commonly apply to
only one specific offense. \* \* \*

3.  Justifications

Unlike failure of proof and offense modification defenses, justification
defenses are not alterations of the statutory definition of the harm
sought to be prevented or punished by an offense. The harm caused by the
justified behavior remains a legally recognized harm which is to be
avoided whenever possible. Under special justifying circumstances,
however, that harm is outweighed by the need to avoid an even greater
harm or to further a greater societal interest.

A forest fire rages toward a town of 10,000 unsuspecting inhabitants.
The actor burns a field of corn located between the fire and the town;
the burned field then serves as a firebreak, saving 10,000 lives. The
actor has satisfied all elements of the offense of arson by setting fire
to the field with the purpose of destroying it. The immediate harm he
has caused---the destruction of the field---is precisely the harm which
the statute serves to prevent and punish. Yet the actor is likely to
have a complete defense, because his conduct and its harmful
consequences were justified. The conduct in this instance is tolerated,
even encouraged, by society. \* \* \*

4.  Excuses

Excuses, like justifications, are usually general defenses applicable to
all offenses even though the elements of the offense are satisfied.
Excuses admit that the deed may be wrong, but excuse the actor because
conditions suggest that the actor is not responsible for his deed. For
instance, suppose that the actor knocks the mailman over the head with a
baseball bat because she believes he is coming to surgically implant a
radio receiver which will take control of her body. The defendant has
satisfied all elements of the offense of aggravated assault---she struck
the mailman with a deadly weapon with the purpose of causing him bodily
injury. This is precisely the harm sought to be prevented by the
statute, and it is not outweighed by any greater societal harm avoided
or greater societal interest furthered. It is conduct that society would
in fact condemn and seek to prevent. The defendant is exculpated only
because her condition at the time of the offense---her paranoid
delusion---suggests that she has not acted through a meaningful exercise
of free will and therefore is not an appropriate subject for criminal
liability. \* \* \*

5.  Nonexculpatory Public Policy Defenses

In 1971 the actor forcibly takes a wallet from an old man at gun point.
The crime goes unsolved until 1978 when he is identified and arrested.
Although he has committed the offense, caused the harm sought to be
prevented by the statute, and has no claim that his conduct is justified
or excused, the actor may nonetheless have a defense. The statute of
limitations may bar his conviction for robbery despite his clear
culpability because by foregoing that conviction society furthers other,
more important, public interests.

Time limitations on criminal prosecutions are often supported as
fostering a more stable and forward-looking society. \* \* \* These
rationales may justify current statutes of limitations, but it must be
noted that they are not based on a lack of culpability of the defendant.
They are purely public policy arguments. \* \* \*

Other public policy-based bars to prosecution include diplomatic
immunity, judicial, legislative, and executive immunities, \* \* \* and
incompetency. Each of the \* \* \* forms of immunity furthers important
societal interests \* \* \*.

This balancing of countervailing public policy interests, both societal
and personal, should be distinguished from the balancing which occurs in
justification defenses. In the latter, the harm done by defendant's act
is outweighed by the societal benefit that it creates, and, as a result,
he is not blameworthy. In nonexculpatory defenses, the defendant's
conduct is harmful, and creates no societal benefit; the defendant is
blameworthy. The societal benefit underlying the defense arises not from
his conduct, but from foregoing his conviction. The defendant escapes
conviction in spite of his culpability.

Principles of Justification

 

**Cydney Chilimidos & Zachary Nemirovsky---An Overview of
Justification**

            Of the varieties of defenses presented in the Robinson
excerpt, justification is unique in that it applies when, despite all of
the elements of an offense being met, and being proved, the criminal
justice system goes farther than merely forgoing punishment. If conduct
is justified, it is considered not even wrongful, and perhaps even
desirable. This is because the law considers a defendant's justified
actions to be at least a (if not "the") desirable outcome.

            For example, if X breaks into Y's house, eats all the food
in the fridge, and stays the night, that is both [criminal
trespass](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/N296B60B072DD11E59B62BAED97A86DDB/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
and
[burglary](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/N20DA7C008D7111D8A8ACD145B11214D7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0).
Breaking into a house is and stealing the owner's food is ordinarily bad
conduct. But the moment that we find out X was trying to escape a
blizzard and hadn't eaten in three days, justification makes their
actions affirmatively the right outcome. What exactly makes this conduct
(or any otherwise wrongful conduct) justified? Why is it that a
defendant who kills to protect their child from a lethal attack is
justified, but a defendant who kills to protect their pet is not
justified? Or is there even a difference?

            There is unfortunately no single theory that tells us why
some actions are justifiable, while others are not, but the following
four theories are often discussed when analyzing various principles of
justification: "public benefit", "moral forfeiture", "moral rights", and
"superior interest / lesser harm."

 

[Public Benefit Theory:]{.underline}

At common law, one of the premier theories of justification was one of
public benefit, s*ee* Eugene R. Milhizer, [*Justification and Excuse:
What They were, What They Are, and What They Ought to
Be*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ib1759fc15ac311dbbd2dfa5ce1d08a25/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
at 841, which justified actions so long as they were taken: (1) for the
public good and (2) by  public officials (such as police officers or
prison wardens) or private parties acting in such roles.

So, for example, a police officer who arrests and handcuffs a suspect is
justified under the public benefit for what would otherwise be criminal
assault. Paul H. Robinson, John M. Darley, [*Testing Competing Theories
Justification*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia8a5ca615a2c11dbbd2dfa5ce1d08a25/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
at 1096-97. The executioner who kills also commits no crime under public
benefit, because of the lawful command to do so. In the private sphere,
this theory usually only grants justification to private citizens if
they are protecting the public from "forcible, atrocious felonies."^1^

One advantage of this theory is that it limits self-defense (and as
such, justified killings) by private individuals to truly justified
circumstances - preventing atrocious felonies. However, public benefit
theory has also been criticized on the one hand for its near blanket
sanction of public acts committed by public officials, and on the other
hand for its limited conception of private self-defense.
Milhizer, [*supra*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ib1759fc15ac311dbbd2dfa5ce1d08a25/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0),
at 841. For example, because a felony would have to be forcible and
atrocious, strict public benefit does not allow for even non-lethal use
of force in the defense of property.
[*Id.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ib1759fc15ac311dbbd2dfa5ce1d08a25/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
at 841-42.

 

[Moral Forfeiture Theory:]{.underline}

            The moral forfeiture theory "is based on the view that
people possess certain moral rights or interests that society recognizes
through its criminal laws, e.g., the right to life.... but which may be
forfeited by the holder of the right" through their misconduct.^2^ For
example, suppose that X repeatedly shoplifts from a store. The owner may
ban X from the premises, and morally justify themselves by saying that X
has *lost the right* to enter the store. In the realm of self-defense,
moral forfeiture theory says that a lethal aggressor has lost their
right to life, and the defendant may use lethal force to defend
themselves. One immediate draw of this theory is that it clearly
comports with the reality that by committing certain acts, people may
forfeit certain rights.^3^

While there are many rights one has, and could forfeit, in self-defense
cases we are concerned with the right to life. The question of what
types of misconduct, exactly, cause someone to forfeit their right to
life is an imprecise and open one. For example, does a burglar who
breaks into a home forfeit their right to life? What about a robber who
holds up a store at gunpoint? What about a perpetrator who violently
assaults someone? It's possible to think that one never forfeits their
right to life (for example, [22 states no longer use the death penalty
for any
crimes](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state)),
but some candidates might be murder or other felonies deemed forcible
and/or atrocious. This also points, however, to perhaps the largest
drawback of the theory (at least in the self-defense context). The right
to life, unlike any other right felons may forfeit, cannot be restored
once taken away and so may be unalienable.

 

[Moral Rights Theory:]{.underline}

            The moral rights theory justifies otherwise wrongful
conduct  because the actor has a right to protect their own interests -
most often, their life or bodily integrity. This theory very easily fits
the example of the "burglar-by-necessity", discussed earlier, who breaks
into a home during a blizzard to save their own life. This theory is in
some ways the counterpart to moral forfeiture.^4^

            In the context of self-defense, this theory justifies a
person who kills a lethal and threatening aggressor because they are
protecting their own right to life.  The actor may also be justified in
killing to thwart their own kidnapping, as they are asserting their
right to autonomy. In states with "Stand Your Ground" laws, this theory
is on full display, allowing someone to kill to defend themselves
without any requirement of retreat. Crucially, it is not that the
aggressor's death is morally irrelevant (as in the moral forfeiture
theory), but that the actor acts to protect their own right.^5^

            One draw of this theory is that it is very intuitive. The
concept that each of us has certain moral rights, which we are morally
entitled to defend, is an easy concept to get behind. It's also hard to
deny, at least in the case of a right to life. But this theory also
doesn't devalue the right to life of the aggressor (as moral forfeiture
or even public benefit, to an extent, do). Application of this theory
must be cautious, however,  because in an unlimited form it abandons any
pretense of proportionality. If my right to, for example, property is
sacrosanct, then I am allowed to kill a pickpocket or a trespasser to
defend it.
Milhizer, [*supra*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ib1759fc15ac311dbbd2dfa5ce1d08a25/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0),
at 843-44. Proportionality is essential to this theory.

 

[Superior Interest (Lesser Harm) Theory:]{.underline}

Lesser harm theory acknowledges that the death of the decedent is a
harm, but justifies conduct so long as it was the *lesser* harm of the
possible outcomes. "Pursuant to this principle, the interests of the
parties, and, more broadly, the values that they seek to enforce, are
balanced."^6^

            Under this theory, for example, one cannot kill a trespasser
in their home because the harm of trespass is less than the harm of
death. An aggressor can be killed only if their death is the lesser harm
(or at least an equally lesser harm) of the possible outcomes, such as
to avoid the death of the actor. As such, this theory is the most
utilitarian in nature.

Lesser harm theory provides a very high bar for when the death of an
aggressor is justified, consistent with the view that human life is of
the utmost value. The drawback here is that, if that is the case, then
one is always required to endure horrific abuse (so long as it is not
lethal) if killing the aggressor is the only option.^7^

** **

[The Theories Applied:]{.underline}

Consider the following hypothetical.  A police officer is investigating
a string of nonviolent burglaries, when she spots the perpetrator
fleeing the scene of the crime. She gives chase, but the burglar is
fast, and she begins to lose him. The officer knows that if he gets
away, the burglar will strike again and again. She shoots and kills him.
Which of the four theories of justification justifies the officer's
actions?

The officer was not protecting any of her *own* rights, so "moral
rights" theory does not help her. The burglar has never used violence,
and most people (certainly, all states) would agree these were
non-capital offenses; the burglar did not, then, forfeit his right to
life. Also, because of the paramount value of human life, the "lesser
harm" theory would counsel that he be allowed to escape. But the officer
is a public official, acting for the public benefit, and so "public
benefit" theory may justify her actions.

What about the following alternatives: (1) the officer was actually a
vigilante homeowner, defending her property from the burglar; (2) the
burglar's prior burglaries were aggravated, using force, and even once
resulted in the death of an innocent; or (3) the burglar had their own
gun, and turned around to shoot the pursuing officer. Do additional
theories of justification help in any of these cases?

Model Penal Code section 3.04

 

<https://www.inazu-crimlaw.com/304>

 

SECTION 3.04. USE OF FORCE IN SELF--PROTECTION

\(1\) *Use of Force Justifiable for Protection of the Person.* Subject
to the provisions of this Section and of Section 3.09, the use of force
upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor believes
that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting
himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the
present occasion.

\(2\) *Limitations on Justifying Necessity for Use of Force.*

\(a\) The use of force is not justifiable under this Section:

\(i\) to resist an arrest that the actor knows is being made by a peace
officer, although the arrest is unlawful; or

\(ii\) to resist force used by the occupier or possessor of property or
by another person on his behalf, where the actor knows that the person
using the force is doing so under a claim of right to protect the
property, except that this limitation shall not apply if:

\(1\) the actor is a public officer acting in the performance of his
duties or a person lawfully assisting him therein or a person making or
assisting in a lawful arrest; or

\(2\) the actor has been unlawfully dispossessed of the property and is
making a re-entry or recaption justified by Section 3.06; or

\(3\) the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself
against death or serious bodily harm.

\(b\) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this Section
unless the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect
himself against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping or sexual
intercourse compelled by force or threat; nor is it justifiable if:

\(i\) the actor, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily
injury, provoked the use of force against himself in the same encounter;
or

\(ii\) the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such
force with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering possession
of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by
complying with a demand that he abstain from any action that he has no
duty to take, except that:

\(1\) the actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place of
work, unless he was the initial aggressor or is assailed in his place of
work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be; and

\(2\) a public officer justified in using force in the performance of
his duties or a person justified in using force in his assistance or a
person justified in using force in making an arrest or preventing an
escape is not obliged to desist from efforts to perform such duty,
effect such arrest or prevent such escape because of resistance or
threatened resistance by or on behalf of the person against whom such
action is directed.

\(c\) Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Subsection, a
person employing protective force may estimate the necessity thereof
under the circumstances as he believes them to be when the force is
used, without retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act
which he has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action.

\(3\) *Use of Confinement as Protective Force.* The justification
afforded by this Section extends to the use of confinement as protective
force only if the actor takes all reasonable measures to terminate the
confinement as soon as he knows that he safely can, unless the person
confined has been arrested on a charge of crime.

No. 24299

**\[ ... \]**

SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:

Indicted for second-degree murder,[^138] and convicted by a jury of
manslaughter[^139] as a lesser included offense,[^140] Bennie L.
Peterson *\[appeals\]***\[ ... \]** He complains**\[ ... \]**that the
judge twice erred in the instructions given the jury in relation to his
claim that the homicide was committed in self-defense. One error alleged
was an instruction that the jury might consider whether Peterson was the
aggressor in the altercation that immediately foreran the
homicide.[^141] The other was an instruction that a failure by Peterson
to retreat, if he could have done so without jeopardizing his safety,
might be considered as a circumstance bearing on the question whether he
was justified in using the amount of force which he did. After careful
study of these arguments in light of the trial record, we affirm
Peterson's conviction.

I

The events immediately preceding the homicide are not seriously in
dispute.[**\[ ... \]**](#X416b6470fe0f8164b898f3c05d72f4ddbe24fb0)
Charles Keitt, the deceased, and two friends drove in Keitt's car to the
alley in the rear of Peterson's house to remove the windshield wipers
from the latter's wrecked car.[^142] While Keitt was doing so, Peterson
came out of the house[^143] into the back yard to protest. After a
verbal exchange, Peterson went back into the house, obtained a pistol,
and returned to the yard.[^144] In the meantime, Keitt had reseated
himself in his car, and he and his companions were about to leave.[^145]

Upon his reappearance in the yard, Peterson paused briefly to load the
pistol.[^146] "If you move," he shouted to Keitt, "I will shoot." He
walked to a point in the yard slightly inside a. gate in the rear fence
and, pistol in hand, said, "If you come in here I will kill you." Keitt
alighted from his car, took a few steps toward Peterson and exclaimed,
"What the hell do you think you are going to do with that?"[^147] Keitt
then made an about-face, walked back to his car and got a lug wrench.
With the wrench in a raised position, Keitt advanced toward Peterson,
who stood with the pistol pointed toward him. Peterson warned Keitt not
to "take another step" and, when Keitt continued onward shot him in the
face from a distance of about ten feet.[^148] Death was apparently
instantaneous. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Ill

More than two centuries ago, Blackstone, best known of the expositors of
the English common law, taught that "all homicide is malicious, and of
course, amounts to murder, unless *justified* by the command or
permission of the law; *excused on* the account of accident or
self-preservation; or *alleviated* into manslaughter, by being either
the involuntary consequence of some act not strictly lawful, or (if
voluntary) occasioned by some sudden and sufficiently violent
provocation.[^149]

Tucked within this greatly capsulized schema of the common law of
homicide is the branch of law we are called upon to administer today. No
issue of justifiable homicide, within Blackstone's definition is
involved.[^150] But Peterson's consistent position is that as a matter
of law his conviction of manslaughter **\[ ... \]**was wrong, and that
his act\' was one of self-preservation--- excused homicide. **\[ ...
\]**

Self-defense, as a doctrine legally exonerating the taking of human
life, is as viable now as it was in Blackstone's[^151] time, and in the
case before us the doctrine is invoked in its purest form.[^152] But
"\[t\]he law of self-defense is a law of necessity[^153] the right of
self-defense arises only when the necessity begins, and equally ends
with the necessity ;[^154] and never must the necessity be greater than
when the force employed defensively is deadly.[^155] The "necessity must
bear all semblance of reality, and appear to admit of no other
alternative, before taking life will be justifiable as excusable."
[^156] Hinged on the exigencies of self-preservation, the doctrine of
homicidal self-defense emerges from the body of the criminal law as a
limited though important exception to legal outlawry of the arena of
self-help in the settlement of potentially fatal personal conflicts.

So it is that necessity is the pervasive theme of the well defined
conditions which the law imposes on the right to kill or maim in
self-defense. There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the
use of deadly force against the defender.[^157] The threat must have
been unlawful[^158] and immediate.[^159] The defender must have believed
that he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm,[^160] and
that his response was necessary . to save himself therefrom.[^161] These
beliefs must not only have been honestly entertained, but also
objectively reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances.[^162]
It is clear that no less than a concurrence of these elements will
suffice.

**\[ ... \]**

IV

**\[ ... \]**

The first of Peterson's complaints centers upon an instruction that the
right to use deadly force in self-defense is not ordinarily available to
one who provokes a conflict or is the aggressor in it. Mere words, the
judge explained, do not constitute provocation or aggression; and if
Peterson precipitated the áltereation but thereafter withdrew from it in
good faith and so informed Keitt by words or acts, he was justified in
using deadly force to save himself from imminent danger or death or
grave bodily harm. **\[ ... \]** Peterson contends that there was no
evidence that he either caused or contributed to the conflict, and that
the instructions on that topic could only *\[have misled\]* the jury.

It has long been accepted that one cannot support a claim of
self-defense by a self-generated necessity to kill.[^163] The right of
homicidal self-defense is granted only to those free from fault in the
difficulty; it is denied to slayers who incite the fatal attack,
encourage the fatal quarrel or otherwise promote the necessitous
occasion for taking life.[^164] The fact that the deceased struck the
first blow, fired the first shot or made the first menacing gesture does
not legalize the self-defense claim if in fact the claimant was the
actual provoker.[^165] In sum, one who is the aggressor in a conflict
culminating in death cannot invoke the necessities of self-preservation.
Only in the event that he communicates to his adversary his intent to
withdraw and in good faith attempts to do so is he restored to his right
of self-defense [^166]

This body of doctrine traces its origin to the fundamental principle
that a killing in self-defense is excusable only as a matter of genuine
necessity.[^167] Quite obviously, a defensive killing is unnecessary if
the occasion for it could have been averted, and the roots of that
consideration run deep with us. **\[ ... \]**

In the case at bar, the trial judge's charge fully comported with these
governing principles. The remaining question, then, is whether there was
evidence to make them applicable to the case. A recapitulation of the
proofs shows beyond peradventure that there was.

It was not until Peterson fetched his pistol and returned to his back
yard that his confrontation with "Keitt took on a deadly cast. Prior to
his trip into the house for the gun, there was, by the Government's
evidence, no threat, no display of weapons, no combat. There was an
exchange of verbal aspersions and a misdemeanor against Peterson's
property was in progress but, at this juncture, nothing more. **\[ ...
\]**

The evidence is uncontradicted that when Peterson reappeared in the yard
with his pistol, Keitt was about to depart the scene. **\[ ... \]**The
uncontroverted fact that Keitt was leaving shows plainly that so far as
he was concerned the confrontation was ended. It demonstrates just as
plainly that even if he had previously been the aggressor, he no longer
was.

Not so with Peterson, however, as the undisputed evidence made clear.
Emerging from the house with the pistol, he paused in the yard to load
it, and to command Keitt not to move. He then walked through the yard to
the rear gate and, displaying his pistol, dared Keitt to come in, and
threatened to kill him if he did. While there appears to be no fixed
rule on the subject, the cases hold, and we agree, that an affirmative
unlawful act reasonably calculated to produce an affray foreboding
injurious or fatal consequences is an aggression which, unless
renounced, nullifies the right of homicidal self-defense. We cannot
escape the abiding conviction that the jury could readily find
Peterson's challenge to be a transgression of that character.

The situation at bar is not unlike that presented in *Laney.* There the
accused, chased along the street by a mob threatening his life, managed
to escape through an areaway between two houses. In the back yard of one
of the houses, he checked a gun he was carrying and then returned to the
areaway. The mob beset him again, and during an exchange of shots one of
its members was killed by a bullet from the accused's gun. In affirming
a conviction of manslaughter, the court reasoned:

It is clearly apparent . . . that, when defendant escaped from the mob
into the back yard \... he was in a place of comparative safety, from
which, if he desired to go home, he could have gone by the back way, as
he subsequently did. The mob had turned its attention to a house on the
opposite side of the street. According to Laney's testimony, there was
shooting going on in the street. His appearance on the street at that
juncture could mean nothing but trouble for him. Hence, when he adjusted
his gun and stepped out into the areaway, he had every reason to believe
that his presence there would provoke trouble. We think his conduct in
adjusting his revolver and going into the areaway was such as to deprive
him of any right to invoke the plea of self-defense.

Similarly, in Rowe v. United States, the accused was in the home of
friends when an argument, to which the friends became participants,
developed in the street in front. He left, went to his nearby apartment
for a loaded pistol and returned. *\[When\]* a group of five men began
to move toward him, he began to shoot at them, killing two, and wounding
a third. We observed that the accused "left an apparently safe haven to
arm himself and return to the scene," and that "he inflamed the
situation with his words to the men gathered there, even though he could
have returned silently to the safety of the \[friends'\] porch." We held
that

\[t\]hese facts could have led the jury to conclude that \[the accused\]
returned to the scene to stir up further trouble, if not actually to
kill anyone, and that his actions instigated the men into rushing him.
Self-defense may not be claimed by one who deliberately places himself
in a position where he has reason to believe "his presence . . . would
provoke trouble."

We noted the argument "that a defendant may claim self-defense if he
arms himself in order to proceed upon his normal activities, even if he
realizes that danger may await him"; we responded by pointing out "that
the jury could have found that the course of action defendant here
followed was for an unlawful purpose.\" We accordingly affirmed his
conviction of manslaughter over his objection that an acquittal should
have been directed.

We are brought much the readier to the same conclusion here. We think
the evidence plainly presented an issue of fact as to whether Peterson's
conduct was an invitation to and provocation of the encounter which
ended in the fatal shot. We sustain the trial judge's action in
remitting that issue for the jury's determination.

V

The second aspect of the trial judge's charge as to which Peterson
asserts error concerned the undisputed fact that at no time did Peterson
endeavor to retreat from Keitt's approach with the lug wrench. The judge
instructed the jury that if Peterson **\[ ... \]** could have safely
retreated but did not do so, that failure was a circumstance which the
jury might consider, together with all others, in determining whether he
went further in repelling the danger, real or apparent, than he was
justified in going.

Peterson contends that this imputation of an obligation to retreat was
error, even if he could safely have done so. He points out that at the
time of the shooting he was standing in his own yard, and argues he was
under no duty to move. We are persuaded to the conclusion that in the
circumstances presented here, the trial judge did not err in giving the
instruction challenged.

Within the common law of self-defense there developed the rule of
"retreat to the wall," which ordinarily forbade the use of deadly force
by one to whom an avenue for safe retreat was open. This doctrine was
but an application of the requirement of strict necessity to excuse the
taking of human life, and was designed to insure the existence of that
necessity. Even the innocent victim of a vicious assault had to elect a
safe retreat, if available, rather than resort to defensive force which
might kill or seriously injure.

In a majority of American jurisdictions, contrarily to the common law
rule, one may stand his ground and use deadly force whenever it seems
reasonably necessary to save himself. While the law of the District of
Columbia on this point is not entirely clear, it seems allied with the
strong minority adhering to the common law. **\[ ... \]**

That is not to say that the retreat rule is without exceptions. Even at
common law it was recognized that it was. not completely suited to all
situations. Today it is the more so that its precept must be adjusted to
modern conditions nonexistent during the early development of the common
law of self-defense. One restriction on its operation comes to the fore
when the circumstances apparently foreclose a withdrawal with safety.
The doctrine of retreat was never intended to enhance the risk to the
innocent; its proper application has never required a faultless victim
to increase his assailant's safety at the expense of his own. On the
contrary, he could stand his ground and use deadly force otherwise
appropriate if the alternative were perilous, or if to him it reasonably
appeared to be.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xc9512ac481c9ecd3142f495e89ff45e37b41a1a)

The trial judge's charge to the jury incorporated *\[this\]* limitations
on the retreat rule. Peterson, however, invokes another --- the
so-called "castle" doctrine. It is well settled that one who through no
fault of his own is attacked in his home is under no duty to retreat
therefrom. The oft-repeated expression that "a man's home is his castle"
reflected the belief in olden days that there were few if any safer
sanctuaries than the home. The "castle" exception, moreover, has been
extended by some courts to encompass the occupant's presence within the
curtilage outside his dwelling. Peterson reminds us that when he shot to
halt Keitt's advance, he was standing in his yard and so, he argues, he
had no duty to endeavor to retreat.

Despite the practically universal acceptance of the "castle" doctrine in
American jurisdictions wherein the point has been raised, its status, in
the District of Columbia has never been squarely decided. But whatever
the fate of the doctrine in the District law of the future, it is clear
that in absolute form it was inapplicable here. The right of
self-defense, we have said, cannot be claimed by the aggressor in an
affray so long as he retains that unmitigated role. It logically follows
that any rule of no-retreat which may protect an innocent victim of the
affray would, like other incidents of a forfeited right of self-defense,
be unavailable to the party who provokes or stimulates the conflict.
Accordingly, the law is well settled that the "castle" doctrine can be
invoked only by one who is without fault in bringing the conflict on.
That, we think, is the critical consideration here.

We need not repeat our previous discussion of Peterson's contribution to
the altercation which culminated in Keitt's death. It suffices to point
out that by no interpretation of the evidence could it be said that
Peterson was blameless in the affair.[**\[ ...

Notes & Questions (United States v. Peterson)

 

By Cydney Chilimidos and Zachary Nemirovsky

**Notes & Questions**

1\. *Who is the Aggressor?* As evidenced in the *Peterson* case, an
aggressor can only assert self defense when certain conditions are met.
Consider the facts surrounding the following fact patterns and determine
who is considered the "aggressor" under the criteria of *Peterson* and
[Model Penal Code
§3.04](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/N01361030025C11DD8320AE42787FBF1D/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0).

a\. Defendant Pippin was out one evening drinking at a bar with his
friend Merry. While going to the bathroom, Pippin accidentally dropped a
locket with a picture of his great-grandmother (a priceless family
heirloom). Merry picked it up, and in his drunken state, thought it
looked horrible and destroyed the picture. When Pippin returned, he was
enraged and pulled a knife on Merry. Merry then pulled out a gun and
killed Pippin. Who is the aggressor?

b\. Stevie is walking down the street when defendant Lindsey calls them
a slur. Enraged, Stevie runs toward Lindsey while voicing their anger
and demanding an apology. Lindsey pulls out a gun and shoots Stevie.
Lindsey argues self defense. Who is the aggressor?

c\. Zainab loves to sit in the sun and work on her tan during the summer
months. In her residential neighborhood, she discovered a fantastic spot
and has used it every summer for the past few years. One day Jose, the
resident bully, decides he doesn't want Zainab using that spot anymore.
He tells her that if she ever suntans in that spot again, he'll kill
her. Zainab could just as easily suntan in another location, but
believing that she has every right to suntan wherever she chooses, she
decides to arm herself the next day. She takes her licensed gun with
her, puts it down next to her so that it is clearly visible, and begins
tanning. Jose shows up soon after, and comes toward her in a threatening
way. Zainab shoots and kills him. Who is the aggressor?

2\. *Aggression under the Model Penal Code.* Suppose that Aviva attempts
to punch Brock. In this circumstance, Aviva is clearly a nonlethal
aggressor. Assume now that Brock escalates the situation  by pulling a
gun on Aviva. Does Brock *now* have the right to kill Aviva? The
Commentary to the Model Penal Code explains the MPC and non-Code
approach to this situation:

        The typical case to be imagined is this: *A* attacks *B* with
his fists; *B* defends himself, and manages to subdue *A* to the extent
of pinning him to the floor. *B* then starts to batter *A*'s head
savagely against the floor. *A* manages to rise, and since *B* is still
attacking him and *A* now fears that if he is thrown again to the floor
he will be killed, *A* uses a knife. *B* is killed or seriously wounded.

        The solution to this situation under the provisions of
\[[Section
3.04](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=L&docname=ULPNCOS3.04&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&fn=_top&findtype=L&vr=2.0&db=1002069&wbtoolsId=ULPNCOS3.04&HistoryType=F)\]
is as follows: *B* is entitled to defend himself against *A*'s attack,
but only to the extent of using moderate, nondeadly force. He is given
this privilege by Subsection (1). *B* exceeds the bounds of "necessary"
force under that provision, however, when, after reducing *A* to
helplessness, he batters *A*'s head on the floor. Since this excessive
force is, in its turn, unlawful, under Subsection (1) *A* is entitled to
defend himself against it and, if he believes that he is then in danger
of death or serious bodily harm without apparent opportunity for safe
retreat, *A* is also entitled to use his knife in self-protection. *A*
of course is criminally liable for his initial battery on *B,* but would
have a justifying defense that he could raise against prosecution for
the ultimate homicide or wounding. Subsection (2)(b)(i), depriving *A*
of his justification on the ground of initial aggression, would not
become operative unless *A* entered the encounter with the purpose of
causing death or serious bodily harm.

        This conclusion---that an initial aggressor is accountable for
his original unlawful use of force but not for his defense against a
disproportionate return of force by his victim---is surely not
unreasonable on its face. There is, however, \* \* \* authority, both
common law and statutory, demanding that a person claiming self-defense
be free from fault in bringing on the difficulty. But the principle is
not, on the whole, unqualified. The original aggressor is usually deemed
to have a right of self-defense that is "imperfect"; before it may be
exercised he must give notice of his wish to desist from the struggle
and attempt in good faith to withdraw.^1^

3\. *Necessity.* As you've discovered from the *Peterson* case, self
defense has a necessity component. This is explained in [*Stiers v.
State*, 229 S.W.3d 257 (Mo. Ct. App.
2007)](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=Y&db=0004644&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&serialnum=2012504005&fn=_top&findtype=Y&vr=2.0&wbtoolsId=2012504005&HistoryType=F),
which indicates that in order "\[t\]o warrant the use of deadly force in
self-defense, \[there\] must be present \... an attempt by the defender
to do all within his or her power consistent with his or her own
personal safety to avoid the danger and need to take a life.

     To this point, consider the case, [*State v. Dill*, 461 So. 2d 1130
(La. Ct. App.
1984)](http://www.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?ft=Y&db=0000735&rs=ap2.0&rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&serialnum=1984160979&fn=_top&findtype=Y&vr=2.0&wbtoolsId=1984160979&HistoryType=F),
where the defendant (5′4″, 145 lbs.) was in his car, preparing to leave
a public parking lot, when the decedent (6′0″, 200 lbs.) walked over and
requested help to start his own vehicle. The defendant asked for five
dollars to help. After a heated exchange, the decedent lunged at the
defendant with a knife through the open car window. The defendant
emerged with a gun and immediately shot the decedent. If you were on the
jury, would you acquit the defendant? Does the shooting meet the
"necessity" requirement? Were there any reasonable alternatives?

4\. *Imminency.* In order for the usage of deadly force to be
justifiable at common law, the actor must be acting in response to
"actual or apparent imminent peril of death or great bodily harm." Why
is the imminency requirement necessary?  How does [Model Penal Code
§3.04](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/N01361030025C11DD8320AE42787FBF1D/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
influence the imminency requirement differently than the common law?

     To challenge your understanding, consider the following situation
devised by Professor Robert Schopp: Two hikers (X and Y) are competing
in a ten-day race across a large desert. The desert contains a single
source of water half-way to the finish line, and cannot be crossed
without it. Each racer is responsible for ensuring they have a five or
six day supply of water, which they can replenish at the water hole. In
the first part of the race, X repeatedly catches Y\'s attempts to change
trail markers and steal X\'s personal water source. [Schopp's
continues](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I10047cc14b0911dba16d88fb847e95e5/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0):

        As day five begins, both hikers are almost out of water \* \*
\*. As Y passes X on the trail \* \* \*, Y holds up a box of rat poison
and says to X, "I'll get you this time; I'll beat you to the water hole,
get my water, and poison the rest \* \* \*." Both hikers walk all day,
but due to a sprained ankle X can barely keep up with Y. That evening,
\* \* \* Y says, "I'll walk all night and get to the water hole before
morning." As Y begins to walk away, X, who is unable to continue that
night, says, "wait," but Y walks in the direction of the water hole. X
shoots Y, convinced \* \* \* that this is the only way to prevent Y from
poisoning the water hole the next morning.

 

     Does X have a valid self-defense claim at common law? What about in
a MPC jurisdiction?

5\. *The requirement to retreat*. *Peterson* sets out arguments both for
and against the retreat rule in its opinion. In [*State v.
Abbot*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I82b9727733e111d986b0aa9c82c164c0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0),
where a fight between neighbors led to a wrestle for control of a
hatchet, in which one neighbor was badly injured, the Supreme Court of
New Jersey noted the following:

        Self-defense is measured against necessity. From that premise
one could readily say there was no necessity to kill in self-defense if
the use of deadly force could have been avoided by retreat. The critics
of the retreat rule do not quarrel with the theoretical validity of this
conclusion, but rather condemn it as unrealistic.

The law of course should not denounce conduct as criminal when it
accords with the behavior of reasonable men. Upon this level, the
advocates of no-retreat say the manly thing is to hold one's ground, and
hence society should not demand what smacks of cowardice. Adherents of
the retreat rule reply it is better that the assailed shall retreat than
that the life of another be needlessly spent. They add that not only do
right-thinking men agree, but further a rule so requiring may well
induce others to adhere to that worthy standard of behavior. \* \* \*

        We believe the following principles are sound:

        1. The issue of retreat arises only if the defendant resorted to
a deadly force. It is deadly force which is not justifiable when an
opportunity to retreat is at hand. Model Penal Code \[§
3.04(2)(b)(ii)\]. As defined in \[§ 3.11(2),\] a deadly force means
"force which the actor uses with the purpose of causing or which he
knows to create a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily
harm." \* \* \*

       2.What constitutes an opportunity to retreat which will defeat
the right of self-defense? As \[§ 3.04(2)(b)(ii)\] of the Model Penal
Code states, deadly force is not justifiable "if the actor knows that he
can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by
retreating \* \* \*." We emphasize "knows" and "with complete safety."
One who is wrongfully attacked need not risk injury by retreating, even
though he could escape with something less than serious bodily injury.
It would be unreal to require nice calculations as to the amount of
hurt, or to ask him to endure any at all. And the issue is not whether
in retrospect it can be found the defendant could have retreated
unharmed. Rather the question is whether he knew the opportunity was
there, and of course in that inquiry the total circumstances including
the attendant excitement must be considered.

6\. *The Castle Doctrine*. Ordinarily, a person has a duty to retreat in
order to avoid violence, if one can safely do so. The Castle Doctrine,
however, as explained in *Peterson*, indicates that a person does not
have a duty to retreat from one's own home and can use lethal force in
cases where one reasonably fears imminent peril of death or serious
bodily harm to oneself.

     The Model Penal Code provides an exception for the workplace as
well, stating that a person "is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling
or place of work, unless he \* \* \* is assailed in his place of work by
another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be." The place
of work exception is as such more limited than the castle doctrine (not
covering the case where the assailant also works there). In light of
which theories of justification does this distinction make sense?

7\. *Stand Your Ground Laws.* Some states, usually as part of their "use
of force" laws, have enacted so-called "Stand Your Ground" laws. These
laws are an expansion of the Castle Doctrine beyond the home, and
provide that a person defending themselves *never* has the requirement
to retreat.^2^ "Stand Your Ground" laws are far from uncontroversial,
with 26 States having such laws. An additional 23 States, however, have
some form of the Castle Doctrine. [As of
2020](%20https:/worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/castle-doctrine-states),
Only Vermont and the District of Columbia have neither.

8\. *Proportionality*. In order for a self defense justification to be
valid, the act made in self defense must be proportional to the act of
aggression. In other words, a nonlethal attack can never be met with
lethal force, even if that is the only way to avoid injury. Consider
this scenario.

     Ozzy threatens to punch Tony if he doesn't get out of his way. The
only way for Tony to escape injury is by pushing Ozzy away from him. A
push is clearly a nondeadly response to a nondeadly threat, but if the
push is likely to cause Ozzy to experience death or great bodily harm
(such as if they are on a bridge, and the push may cause Tony to fall
and plumet to his death), then the common law requires Tony to suffer
Ozzy's punch, rather than risk the death of the nonlethal aggressor.
What goals does this rule accomplish? Do you agree with this rule?

9*. Misdemeanors and Property*. Do you think that other justifications
for the defendant's use of force in *Peterson* existed? What about the
desire to stop a misdemeanor? The desire to specifically defend his own
property?

     In footnotes 57 and 58 of *Peterson*, the court answers "no." The
court says, "\[i\]t is well settled that deadly force cannot be employed
to arrest or prevent the escape of a misdemeanant,"^3^ and that "\[t\]he
law never tolerates the use of deadly force in the protection of one\'s
property."^4^

How does this relate to the Castle Doctrine? If a person is not allowed
to defend their home, but they are permitted to defend themselves in
their home without retreating, what do you think is likely to result?

10.       *Excuse vs. Justification.* After considering all of the
above, does it matter whether self defense is considered an excuse or a
justification? Why doesn't the *Peterson* court think the distinction
matters? Consider the following footnote from *Peterson*:

By the early common law, justification for homicide extended only to
acts done in execution of the law, such as homicides in effecting
arrests and preventing forcible felonies, and homicides committed in
self-defense were only excusable. See, generally, authorities cited
*supra* note 34. The distinction between justifiable and excusable
homicide was important because in the latter case the slayer, considered
to be not wholly free from blame, suffered a forfeiture of his goods. F.
Wharton, Homicide § 3 at 211 (1855). However, with the passage of 24
Henry VIII, ch. 5 (1532), the basis of justification was enlarged, and
the distinction has largely disappeared. More usually the terms are used
interchangeably, each denoting a legally non-punishable act, entitling
the accused to an acquittal.^5^

(1985).

^2^ For example, Florida's Stand Your Ground law provides that "A person
who uses \...  deadly force in accordance with this subsection does not
have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if
\[they are\] not engaged in a criminal activity...." [Fla. Stat. Ann. §
776.012](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/NE7F69CA0F29311E381A6F8227AB9E8E4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0).

State v. Abbott

 

Supreme Court of New Jersey

36 N.J. 63

1961-11-06

36 N.J. 63 (1961)

174 A.2d 881

### STATE OF NEW JERSEY, PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT, v. FRANK ABBOTT, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey.

Argued September 13, 1961.

Decided November 6, 1961.

\[66\] *Mr. Charles Handler* argued the cause for defendant-appellant
(*Mr. Joel F. Handler,* on the brief).

*Mr. Martin L. Greenberg,* Assistant Prosecutor, argued the cause for
plaintiff-respondent (*Mr. Brendan T. Byrne,* Essex County Prosecutor,
attorney).

The opinion of the court was delivered by WEINTRAUB, C.J.

Frank Abbott was convicted of atrocious assault and battery. The
Appellate Division affirmed, 64 *N.J. Super.* 191 (1960), and we granted
certification, 34 *N.J.* 176 (1961).

Abbott shared a common driveway with his neighbors, Michael and Mary
Scarano. The Scaranos engaged a contractor to pave their portion. Abbott
obtained some asphalt from the contractor and made a doorstop to keep
his garage door from swinging onto the Scaranos\' property. Nicholas
Scarano, who was visiting with the Scaranos, his parents, objected to
Abbott\'s innovation. After some words between them a fist fight ensued.

Although Abbott managed to land the first punch, with which he sent
Nicholas to the ground, a jury could find Nicholas was the aggressor. At
this point Michael Scarano came at Abbott with a hatchet. Michael said
the tool had just been returned to him by the contractor, and denied he
\[67\] meant to use it as a weapon. According to Abbott, Mary Scarano
followed, armed with a carving knife and large fork. The actors gave
varying versions of what happened, but the end result was that all of
the Scaranos were hit by the hatchet. Nicholas received severe head
injuries. Abbott claimed he too suffered a laceration.

Abbott admitted he finally wrested the hatchet from Michael but denied
he wielded it at all. Rather he insisted that the Scaranos were injured
during a common struggle for the instrument. A jury could, however, find
Abbott intentionally inflicted the blows.

Abbott was separately indicted for atrocious assault and battery upon
each of the Scaranos. There was a common trial of these indictments. The
jury acquitted Abbott of the charges relating to Michael and Mary, but
found him guilty as to Nicholas.

## I.

The principal question is whether the trial court properly instructed
the jury upon the issue of self-defense. The trial court charged upon
the subject of excessive force, as to which Abbott does not complain. It
charged also upon the subject of retreat, and it is here that error is
alleged. Although the jury could have found Abbott used excessive force,
we cannot know whether the jury found for him on that subject and
convicted because he had failed to retreat in accordance with the trial
court\'s instruction.

As to retreat, the trial court charged upon two hypotheses. One was that
the critical events occurred upon Abbott\'s property. Upon that basis,
the court said Abbott could stand his ground, and, of course, of this
Abbott does not complain. The second hypothesis was that the alleged
offense occurred upon the common driveway. Presumably on the authority
of *State v. Pontery,* 19 *N.J.* 457, 475 (1955), the trial court held
that since all the principals were equally entitled to be on the
driveway, Abbott could not claim immunity \[68\] from the ordinary
retreat rule. Abbott does not question that thesis, but disputes the
court\'s statement of the conditions under which an obligation to
retreat would arise.

## A.

We have the preliminary question whether defendant must demonstrate
\"plain error\" to question the instruction. As the Appellate Division
noted, defendant did not record a protest to the charge as given. But he
had requested a charge and did note his objection to the trial court\'s
refusal to grant it. His request was erroneous, but nonetheless it is
plain he did not acquiesce in the trial court\'s version. The important
fact is that the trial court was alerted to the basic problem and
charged in a manner different from the request made. In such
circumstances, especially when the controlling principles are complex or
unsettled, it would be unreasonable to deny a review merely because a
defendant failed to project a formula which squares with our concept of
the true doctrine. We would never deny relief merely because a
litigant\'s position on appeal went beyond the point we found to be
correct. We should not demand a greater capacity for prediction during
the trial itself. We accordingly reach the meritorious issue.

## B.

The subject of retreat usually arises in homicide matters. We will first
discuss it in that context, and then consider whether the principles
apply to a charge of atrocious assault and battery, and if they do,
whether the trial court correctly guided the jury in this difficult
area.

We should make it clear that we are discussing the doctrine of retreat
and not the subject of the use of excessive force. If the force used was
unnecessary in its intensity, the claim of self-defense may fall for
that reason. In the discussion which follows we assume a defendant used
no more force \[69\] than he believed necessary to protect himself in
the circumstances as they reasonably appeared to him, and consider only
whether the claim of self-defense should be denied because he could have
avoided the use of that force by retreating.

The question whether one who is neither the aggressor nor a party to a
mutual combat must retreat has divided the authorities. Self-defense is
measured against necessity. *Brown v. State,* 62 *N.J.L.* 666, 708 (*E.
& A.*), affirmed, 175 *U.S.* 172, 20 *S.Ct.* 77, 44 *L.Ed.* 119 (1899);
*State v. Hipplewith,* 33 *N.J.* 300, 316-318 (1960). From that premise
one could readily say there was no necessity to kill in self-defense if
the use of deadly force could have been avoided by retreat. The critics
of the retreat rule do not quarrel with the theoretical validity of this
conclusion, but rather condemn it as unrealistic. The law of course
should not denounce conduct as criminal when it accords with the
behavior of reasonable men. Upon this level, the advocates of no-retreat
say the manly thing is to hold one\'s ground, and hence society should
not demand what smacks of cowardice. Adherents of the retreat rule reply
it is better that the assailed shall retreat than that the life of
another be needlessly spent. They add that not only do right-thinking
men agree, but further a rule so requiring may well induce others to
adhere to that worthy standard of behavior. There is much dispute as to
which view commands the support of ancient precedents, a question we
think it would be profitless to explore.

Other jurisdictions are closely divided upon the retreat doctrine. It is
said that the preponderant view rejects it. *Perkins, Criminal Law* 899
(1957); 1 *Warren, Homicide* § 157, at *pp.* 767-68 (*perm. ed.* 1938);
*Model Penal Code* § 3.04, comment 3, at *p.* 24 (*Tent. Draft No.* 8,
1958). For additional discussions of the contending views see 1
*Wharton, Criminal Law and Procedure* § 235 (*Anderson* 1957);
Annotation, 2 *L.R.A.* (*N.S.*) 49 (1906); Annotation, 18 *A.L.R.* 1279
(1922). Our Court of Errors and \[70\] Appeals deliberately adopted the
retreat rule with an awareness of the contending views, *State v. Di
Maria,* 88 *N.J.L.* 416 (*Sup. Ct.* 1916), affirmed o.b., 90 *N.J.L.*
341 (*E. & A.* 1917), and the doctrine has since been invoked. *State v.
Centalonza,* 18 *N.J. Super.* 154 (*App. Div.* 1952); *cf.* *State v.
Goldberg,* 12 *N.J. Super.* 293 (*App. Div.* 1951). The *Model Penal
Code* embraces the retreat rule while acknowledging that on numerical
balance a majority of the precedents oppose it. *Model Penal Code* §
3.04, comment 3, at *p.* 24 (*Tent. Draft No.* 8, 1958).

We are not persuaded to depart from the principle of retreat. We think
it salutary if reasonably limited. Much of the criticism goes not to its
inherent validity but rather to unwarranted applications of the rule.
For example, it is correctly observed that one can hardly retreat from a
rifle shot at close range. But if the weapon were a knife, a lead of a
city block might well be enough. Again, the rule cannot be stated
baldly, with indifference to the excitement of the occasion. As Mr.
Justice Holmes cryptically put it, \"Detached reflection cannot be
demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.\" *Brown v. United
States,* 256 *U.S.* 335, 343, 41 *S.Ct.* 501, 65 *L.Ed.* 961, 963
(1921). Such considerations, however, do not demand that a man should
have the absolute right to stand his ground and kill in any and all
situations. Rather they call for a fair and guarded statement of
appropriate principles.

In *Brown, supra,* the United States Supreme Court said (256 *U.S.,* at
*p.* 343, 41 *S.Ct.,* at *p.* 502, 65 *L.Ed.,* at *p.* 963):

> \"\* \* \* Rationally the failure to retreat is a circumstance to be
> considered with all the others in order to determine whether the
> defendant went farther than he was justified in doing; not a
> categorical proof of guilt.\"

The comment to § 3.04 of the *Model Penal Code* (at *p.* 24) says the
passage just quoted \"seems to be a median position\" and \"would
apparently remit the issue to the jury, without \[71\] a legal mandate
on the point.\" We are not sure we correctly understand these
observations. We think it clear that *Brown* accepted the retreat
doctrine, but we do not read the opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes to mean
that the subject should be submitted without guidance, thus permitting
each jury to decide whether the subject of retreat should be considered,
and if so, what the ingredients of the doctrine should be. We know of no
jurisdiction which leaves to a jury the task of devising the legal
principles. Rather we read *Brown* to hold only that the particular
\"formula laid down by the \[trial\] court\" was not \"adequate to the
protection of the defendant\'s rights\" (256 *U.S.,* at *pp.* 342-343,
41 *S.Ct.,* at *p.* 502, 65 *L.Ed.,* at *pp.* 962-63) in the factual
pattern which the defendant there asserted.

We believe the following principles are sound:

1\. The issue of retreat arises only if the defendant resorted to a
deadly force. It is deadly force which is not justifiable when an
opportunity to retreat is at hand. *Model Penal Code* § 3.04(2)(b)(iii).
As defined in § 3.12(2) a deadly force means \"force which the actor
uses with the purpose of causing or which he knows to create a
substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.\"

Hence it is not the nature of the force defended against which raises
the issue of retreat, but rather the nature of the force which the
accused employed in his defense. If he does not resort to a deadly
force, one who is assailed may hold his ground whether the attack upon
him be of a deadly or some lesser character. Although it might be argued
that a safe retreat should be taken if thereby the use of *any* force
could be avoided, yet, as the comment in the *Model Penal Code* observes
(at *p.* 23), \"The logic of this position never has been accepted when
moderate force is used in self-defense; here all agree that the actor
may stand his ground and estimate necessity upon that basis.\" *Cf.
Prosser, Torts* § 19, at *p.* 90 (2*d ed.* 1955); *Restatement, Torts* §
63 (1934). Hence, in a case like the present one, the jury should be
instructed that Abbott could hold his ground when Nicholas \[72\] came
at him with his fists, and also when Michael and Mary came at him with
the several instruments mentioned, and that the question of retreat
could arise only if Abbott intended to use a deadly force.

2\. What constitutes an opportunity to retreat which will defeat the
right of self-defense? As § 3.04(2)(b)(iii) of the *Model Penal Code*
states, deadly force is not justifiable \"if the actor *knows* that he
can avoid the necessity of using such force *with complete safety* by
retreating \* \* \*.\" We emphasize \"knows\" and \"with complete
safety.\" One who is wrongfully attacked need not risk injury by
retreating, even though he could escape with something less than serious
bodily injury. It would be unreal to require nice calculations as to the
amount of hurt, or to ask him to endure any at all. And the issue is not
whether in retrospect it can be found the defendant could have retreated
unharmed. Rather the question is whether he knew the opportunity was
there, and of course in that inquiry the total circumstances including
the attendant excitement must be considered. We add that upon a retrial
the facts as developed in the light of this principle may be such that
Abbott would be entitled to an instruction that if his version of the
approach by Michael and Mary is accepted, the issue of retreat must be
resolved in Abbott\'s favor.

3\. There has been some uncertainty in the language of our cases upon
the burden of proof with respect to self-defense. The decisions are
treated in *State v. Chiarello,* 69 *N.J. Super.* 479 (1961), where the
Appellate Division correctly said that although the burden is upon a
defendant to adduce evidence to support the defense, yet if such
evidence appears either in the State\'s case or upon the defendant\'s
case, the issue must be left to the jury with this instruction: that the
burden is upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defense is untrue, and hence there must be an acquittal if there is a
reasonable doubt as to whether defendant did act in self-defense within
the definition of that defense. Accordingly, if the issue of \[73\]
retreat is raised in connection with the defense of self-defense, the
jury should be instructed that the burden is also the State\'s to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew he could have retreated
with complete safety, and that if a reasonable doubt upon that question
should exist, the issue of retreat must be resolved in defendant\'s
favor.

## C.

As we have said, the subject of retreat arises most often in homicide
cases. It is equally pertinent if the charge is assault with intent to
kill (*N.J.S.* 2A:90-2). *State v. Centalonza, supra* (18 *N.J. Super.*
154). Here the charge is atrocious assault and battery (*N.J.S.*
2A:90-1), a crime which involves vicious or brutal conduct. *State v.
Riley,* 28 *N.J.* 188, 197-198 (1958), appeal dismissed and *cert.*
denied, 359 *U.S.* 313, 79 *S.Ct.* 891, 3 *L.Ed.*2*d* 832 (1959). An
intent to kill is not an ingredient of that offense, but an intent to do
serious bodily harm would seem to be implicit. The doctrine of retreat
reflects a policy with respect to the use of deadly force, and the same
policy considerations equally obtain if the end result is something less
than murder. The Appellate Division held the doctrine applicable to
atrocious assault and battery. The comment to Article 3 of the *Model
Penal Code* (at *p.* 3) expresses the same view, saying, \"If the
particular force, for example, would be unjustifiable in a prosecution
for homicide it should be equally unjustifiable if the victim survives
and what is charged is an assault.\" This seems sound, and hence an
instruction upon the subject is appropriate in a trial for atrocious
assault and battery, but the instruction should be expressly centered
about the use of deadly force.

## D.

We turn to the instruction of the trial court. It reads:

> \"\* \* \* If you find the charges involved or either of them happened
> on the joint or common driveway and that the defendant \[74\] had an
> available opportunity to retreat and you also find that he was or
> appeared to be threatened by assault and battery with imminent danger
> of life or serious bodily harm, again there is no duty to retreat. On
> the other hand, under the latter circumstances, if you find that he
> did not appear to be threatened by assault and battery with imminent
> danger of life or great bodily harm, he had a duty to retreat and if
> he failed to retreat the defense of self-defense would not avail him
> and would not constitute a defense to these charges or any of these
> charges if you find that he had a duty to retreat.\"

It is at once apparent that the charge consists of abstract
propositions, unanchored to the factual setting. It will be recalled the
encounter had two phases, although one quickly followed the other. The
first phase was an unarmed attack by Nicholas which Abbott met in kind;
the second involved, as the jury could find, an attack or apparent
attack by hatchet in the hands of Michael and by kitchen utensils
allegedly wielded by Mary, both aided by Nicholas who had arisen from
the initial punch. We have no way of knowing whether the jury understood
Abbott was required to retreat when first assailed by Nicholas alone.
The jury may well have so gathered since the instruction excluded
self-defense \"if you find that he \[Abbott\] did *not* appear to be
threatened by assault and battery with imminent danger of life or great
bodily harm,\" and of course Nicholas\'s attack with his fists readily
fitted within those terms.

The State asks us to assume the jury understood an unarticulated
premise, *i.e.,* that the court was referring solely to the hatchet
affair. If we could so assume, still under the instruction the
obligation to retreat would depend upon the nature of the attack upon
Abbott rather than the amount of force Abbott intended to employ. In
short, there was no reference to the use of a deadly force by Abbott.
And if we should read the charge in still another way, to wit, that the
court was merely defining its prior reference to \"an available
opportunity\" to retreat and hence meant that the opportunity was not
\"available\" if retreat would have subjected Abbott to imminent danger
to his life or of great bodily harm but was \"available\" if he could
get away with \[75\] a hurt of lesser character, still the charge would
be incorrect. This is so because there is no obligation to retreat
unless retreat can be effected \"with complete safety,\" and indeed with
knowledge that retreat can be so effected. Further, upon that
interpretation, the instruction would be devoid of any statement of the
facts prerequisite for consideration of the subject, *i.e.,* an intent
by the defendant to use a deadly force.

We have said enough to indicate the insufficiency of the charge. Even
upon study and restudy we are not sure we can extract the thesis the
trial court held. A jury which listens to a single reading of an
instruction cannot be expected to debate its meaning and reach a correct
view of it. A charge should be a clear, unambiguous guide related to the
evidence in the case. The conviction must be reversed.

## II.

The record of Abbott\'s direct examination reads in part:

\"Q. How much do you weigh, Mr. Abbott? A. At the present time?

Q. At the present time. A. Just close to 200 pounds, right now.

Q. Now, on July 15, 1957 \[the date of the alleged crime\] do you know
how much you weighed? About July 15, not necessarily on that day, say
within a few pounds either way. A. About 135, 140 pounds, I guess.

Q. Why was your weight so low at that time?

Mr. Loftus: I object on the ground it is irrelevant. I don\'t see any
relevancy to this situation.

The Court: I will sustain the objection.\"

Defendant complains he was thereby barred from showing serious medical
conditions, pertinent to his ability to defend with lesser force or to
retreat with safety. The Appellate Division held defendant failed to
comply with *R.R.* 1:5-1(a) in that he did not object to the ruling, and
further held there was no manifest wrong or injury.

The cited rule reads in part:

\"\* \* \* Error in the admission or rejection of testimony, or in the
charge of the court, or in the refusal to charge as requested by \[76\]
the defendant, or in the denial by the court of any matter resting in
discretion, or in any other ruling or order made during the course of
the trial, shall be cause for reversal *if specific objection thereto
was made* and it appears from the entire record of the proceedings had
upon the trial that the defendant thereby suffered manifest wrong or
injury.\" (Emphasis added)

Read literally, this rule would seem to require a specific objection to
be stated after an offer of proof has been rejected, and some casual
statements might be read to support that theme. *State v. Gibson,* 15
*N.J.* 384, 391 (1954); *State v. Huff,* 14 *N.J.* 240, 248 (1954);
*State v. Hogan,* 20 *N.J. Super.* 1, 9 (*App. Div.* 1952). Thus
understood, the rule could be thought to continue the discredited
practice of former days under which error could not be asserted on
appeal unless at the trial counsel had intoned \"exception.\"

Our rules do not perpetuate mere ritual. Rather the purpose is to
require a litigant to make known his position to the end that the trial
court may consciously rule upon it. When that has happened, it would be
pure ceremony to require some further protest. This view is embodied in
*R.R.* 3:7-8, which reads as follows and in the light of which *R.R.*
1:5-1(a), quoted above, must be understood:

> \"Exceptions to rulings or orders of the court or instructions to the
> jury are not required in order to reserve the questions involved for
> review on appeal; and for all purposes for which an exception has
> heretofore been necessary it suffices that the defendant, at the time
> the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the
> court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection
> to the action of the court and the grounds therefor; but if a party
> has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence of an
> objection shall not thereafter prejudice him.\"

Actually in the Tentative Draft (1948) of our rules, the provisions of
this rule appeared in *Rule* 1:2-14(a), the forerunner of *R.R.*
1:5-1(a).

Applied to the admission and exclusion of evidence, these rules have
this effect: If a litigant complains of the *admission* of evidence, he
must show he objected to its receipt and stated the reasons for his
opposition. If he did, no more is required to preserve his right to
appellate \[77\] review. If the litigant complains of an *exclusion* of
evidence, it is enough that his adversary\'s objection was upheld unless
he refused an opportunity to tell the court why he thought the evidence
should be admitted. Here Abbott complains of the exclusion of proof. The
State objected to the offer as \"irrelevant.\" If the trial court wished
Abbott to explain his thesis, an opportunity to do so should have been
given. The trial court did not, but rather, apparently satisfied it
fully appreciated what was involved, upheld the State. We see no reason
to require Abbott to utter \"I object\" or to attempt to argue against a
ruling already announced. He made known the ruling he wished, *i.e.,*
admission of the evidence he offered. He did not decline an opportunity
to enlighten the court. We are satisfied the alleged error is presented
without recourse to the doctrine of \"plain error.\"

There is a different question with which the one just discussed should
not be confused. That question is whether a litigant must spread on the
record the essence of what he would have proved but for the adverse
ruling. *R.R.* 4:44-3 provides \"the examining attorney may make a
specific offer of what he expects to prove by the answer of the
witness.\" The rule in terms applies to civil matters but is merely
declaratory of prior good practice and should be observed as well in
criminal proceedings. Without such disclosure, an appellate court cannot
readily evaluate whether the exclusion, although erroneous, resulted in
manifest wrong or injury. *State v. Micci,* 46 *N.J. Super.* 454, 458
(*App. Div.* 1957); see *State v. Gambutti,* 36 *N.J. Super.* 219, 233
(*App. Div.* 1955); *New Jersey Highway Authority v. Rudd,* 36 *N.J.
Super.* 1, 5 (*App. Div.* 1955).

Of course the details of the proffered proof ultimately depend upon the
integrity of counsel, and that being so, a representation first made on
appeal might be argued to be no less meaningful. But the proffer should
be made at trial, for at least the reason that the statement may well
induce the trial judge to reconsider and perhaps to reverse his ruling.

\[78\] Our experience indicates widespread failure to place such offers
upon the trial record. Indeed, frequently we receive our first glimpse
in response to questions at oral argument. In the present case the
disclosure first appeared in the brief on appeal, wherein we are told
defendant wanted to prove serious injuries and illness from which he was
in the process of recovery at the time of the alleged offense. The
admissibility of such proof on the issues of excessive force and of
retreat is too evident to require discussion. The question disallowed
was on its face suggestive of proof of that kind. Since the judgment
must be reversed for other reasons already given, we need not speak
further of the sufficiency of the record. But we take this opportunity
to remind the bar that a failure to spread the offer on the trial record
may lead the appellate court to conclude that it cannot find the error
was harmful.

## III.

Abbott further urges the State could not move the indictment against him
because prior thereto it had brought Michael Scarano to trial for
assault with intent to kill him, which trial resulted in an acquittal.
We think the Appellate Division correctly rejected this contention.

## IV.

Since the case must be remanded, we refer to a ruling of which Abbott
does not here complain, lest it be repeated at a retrial. During direct
examination Abbott was asked, \"At any time did you intentionally strike
anybody with this ax?\" The State objected \"on the ground it is
leading,\" and was sustained. Curiously, a question essentially the same
had already been asked and answered. After that question was answered,
the State objected without specifying any ground. The trial court
replied, \"I think it is admissible and is answered anyway. I will
permit it to stand.\"

The objection that the question was \"leading\" was unsound. In a sense
every question is \"leading.\" If \[79\] interrogation did not lead, a
trial would get nowhere. Indeed one vice of a question such as, \"What
is your position in this case?,\" is that it does not lead enough, and
thus would deny the opposing party an opportunity to guard against the
rankest kind of improper proof. A question must invite the witness\'s
attention to something. No formula can be stated with confidence that it
will embrace all situations. But it may be said that ordinarily a
question is not improperly leading unless it suggests what the answer
should be or contains facts which in the circumstances can and should
originate with the witness. See generally *McCormick, Evidence* § 6
(1954); 3 *Wigmore, Evidence* §§ 769-72 (3*d ed.* 1940). The question
whether Abbott intentionally struck any of the Scaranos with the ax was
perfectly proper; we do not see how else it could be phrased. *Cf.*
*State v. Len,* 108 *N.J.L.* 439, 440 (*Sup. Ct.* 1932).

Since the objection to the earlier question was not particularized, it
is appropriate to add that questions addressed to the mental operations
of a defendant are thoroughly proper when such operations are an
ingredient of the State\'s case or of a defense. See *State v. Myers,* 7
*N.J.* 465, 483 (1951); *State v. Len, supra* (108 *N.J.L.* 439).
Relevancy and materiality are obvious. And a defendant\'s competency to
testify thereto is equally plain. Indeed no one knows better than he. Of
course, he may not be believed, but his self-interest is not a bar, and
has not been since the demise of the common-law rule which denied the
stand to a party to a controversy. See 2 *Wigmore, Evidence* § 579, at
*p.* 701 (3*d ed.* 1940).

The judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent herewith.

OPINION

SERNA, Justice.

{1} Defendant Cecil Boyett appeals from his conviction for the first
degree murder of Deborah Rhodes (Victim), contrary to NMSA 1978, Section
30-2-1(A) (1963, as amended through 1994). He alleges that the trial
court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on his theory of the case
and in denying his motion for a new trial. We discern no error and
affirm Defendant's conviction.

I. BACKGROUND

{2} Defendant and Victim had a rancorous history. The enmity that each
harbored for the other apparently had its roots in a romantic interest
that both had in Renate Wilder (Wilder).

{3} Wilder and Victim were childhood friends who eventually moved in
together and started an intimate relationship. Although their romance
ended, the two remained close friends, living and working together.
Wilder later met Defendant, and the two became romantically involved.
Wilder eventually supplanted Victim's presence in her life with that of
Defendant. She fired Victim from her bar and gave Victim's former job to
Defendant. She ousted Victim from her home with the help of a
restraining order and invited Defendant to move in. At one point, Victim
discovered the entwined couple near the hot tub behind Wilder's house.
Enraged, Victim retrieved a gun from the house and used it to threaten
the couple. Disdain developed between Defendant and Victim, and Victim
only occasionally returned to Wilder's home after she was forced out.

{4} Following a protracted courtship, Wilder and Defendant planned to
marry on February 6, 2004. A few days prior to her wedding, Wilder
absconded from the home that she shared with Defendant. She spent that
time with Victim and did not tell Defendant where she was or what she
was doing. Wondering as to her whereabouts, Defendant engaged in a
variety of activities aimed at locating her but was unsuccessful in his
attempts; he rightfully suspected that she was with Victim although he
was unable, at that time, to confirm his suspicions.

{5} On the afternoon of February 5, 2004, Wilder departed Victim's
company to return to her own home but had a car accident along the way.
**\[ ... \]** Wilder **\[ ... \]**departed the scene on foot, walking
back to the house that she shared with Defendant. Shortly after Wilder
returned to the house, Victim arrived. Victim's visit concluded when
Defendant shot her in the head with a .357 revolver from approximately
four feet away, but the events leading to that end were disputed at
trial.

{6} The State successfully argued **\[ ... \]**that Victim went to the
house to return Wilder's keys and makeup bag, which she had forgotten in
the wrecked car. The State argued that before Victim could accomplish
that goal, Defendant opened the front door, shouted at her to leave the
property, and then immediately shot her.

{7} Defendant's version of events was quite different. He claimed that
Victim came to the house that day intent on killing him to prevent his
impending marriage to Wilder. Defendant testified that he heard a loud
banging at the front door, grabbed the gun that he kept nearby, and
opened the door only to find a furious Victim on the doorstep. Defendant
said that he shouted at Victim, telling her to get off his property, but
in the process of trying to run her off, he observed her draw the gun
that he knew she routinely carried. In fear for his life, Defendant
raised his revolver and shot Victim. Defendant asserted that if he had
not shot her, she would have fired her gun and fatally wounded him.

{8} Defendant **\[ ... \]**argued that he was not guilty because he
acted lawfully in shooting Victim, either in self defense, defense of
another, or defense of habitation. **\[ ... \]**

The trial court concluded that the jury instruction related to defense
of habitation, UJI 14-5170 NMRA, did not apply in this case because
Defendant did not shoot Victim inside his home. **\[ ... \]** Based on
the instructions that it was given, the jury convicted Defendant of
first degree murder.

**\[ ... \]**

II\. DEFENDANT WAS NOT ENTITLED TO THE REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTIONS

**\[ ... \]**

B. Defense of Habitation

{14} The trial court denied the defense of habitation instruction based
on its conclusion that the defense applies to only those situations in
which an intruder is killed within the home. **\[ ... \]** the State now
argues that the defense should be limited to situations in which a
person forcibly enters a home and is killed while intruding therein. By
that argument, the State seeks our endorsement of a bright line rule
that would require an intruder to cross the threshold before an
occupant's use of force to repel that entry could be justified by
defense of habitation. Despite the State's contention, we are unwilling
to draw such a bright line.

{15} Defense of habitation **\[ ... \]**gives a person the right to use
lethal force against an intruder when such force is necessary to prevent
the commission of a felony in his or her home. **\[ ... \]**The defense
is grounded in the theory that "\[t\]he home is one of the most
important institutions of the state, and has ever been regarded as a
place where a person has a right to stand his \[or her\] ground and
repel, force by force, to the extent necessary for its protection."
*State v. Couch,* 52 N.M. 127, 134, 193 P.2d 405, 409 (1946) (quoted
authority omitted). Ultimately, in every purported defense of
habitation, the use of deadly force is justified only if the defendant
reasonably believed that the commission of a felony in his or her home
was immediately at hand and that it was necessary to kill the intruder
to prevent that occurrence.

**\[ ... \]**

{16} This Court has refused to extend the defense to situations in which
the victim was fleeing from the defendant, *Gonzales,* **\[ ... \]**, as
well as situations in which the victim had lawfully entered the
defendant's home, *see State v. Abeyta,* 120 N.M. 233, 244, 901 P.2d
164, 175 (1995) *(abrogated on other grounds by State v. Campos,*
1996-NMSC-043, 122 N.M. 148, 921 P.2d 1266). But our courts have never
held that entry into the defendant's home is a prerequisite for the
defense. On the contrary, the seminal New Mexico case on defense of
habitation was clear that, in certain circumstances, it may justify an
occupant's use of lethal force against an intruder who is outside the
home. *Bailey,* 27 N.M. at 162, 198 P. at 534.

**\[ ... \]***Bailey* explained that defense of habitation justifies
killing an intruder who is assaulting the defendant's home with the
intent of reaching its occupants and committing a felony against them.
*Id.* Protecting a defendant's right to prevent forced entry
necessitates that the defense apply when an intruder is outside the home
but endeavoring to enter it. *See id.* This interpretation of defense of
habitation is supported by *Couch,* where the defendant fired a shotgun
from within his home at an intruder who was outside, pelting the home
with rocks. 52 N.M. at 130, 193 P.2d at 406. Prior to the night of the
shooting, the defendant's home had repeatedly been broken into, which
caused he and his wife to "suffer intensely from apprehension of
violence at the hands of the unknown intruder." *Id.* at 130, 139, 193
P.2d at 406, 412. When the later assault on their home occurred, both
the defendant and his wife believed that the attackers were the same
people who had previously broken in. *Id.* at 139, 193 P.2d at 412. This
Court concluded that, even though the victim was killed outside the
home, the defendant was entitled to an instruction on defense of
habitation because he could reasonably have believed that the person
attacking it intended to enter and commit violence against the
occupants. *See id.* at 140, 145, 193 P.2d at 412-13, 416.

{18} The proposition that defense of habitation allows one to kill to
prevent an intruder's forced entry is well supported by the law in other
jurisdictions and treatises on the subject. **\[ ... \]**

{19} Based on our precedent and the authorities cited above, we cannot
accept the position that defense of habitation requires an intruder to
cross the threshold of the defendant's home. Instead, we emphasize that
a person has a right to defend his or her residence not only when an
intruder is already inside the home, but also when an intruder is
outside the home and attempting to enter to commit a violent felony.
*Bailey,* 27 N.M. at 162, 198 P. at 534.

{20} We recognize that "\[t\]he term felony in former times carried a
connotation of greater threat than" it does today. *State v.
Pellegrino,* 577 N.W.2d 590, 596 (S.D.1998). "In the common law, the
rule developed that use of lethal force to prevent a felony was only
justified if the felony was a forcible and atrocious crime." *Id.*
(quoted authority omitted). Felonies are no longer constrained to
forcible and atrocious crimes, and were we not to update *Bailey's*
"felony" language, defense of habitation may apply to situations in
which an intruder attempts to force entry into a home with the purpose
of committing a non-violent felony, such as bribing a public official
therein. *See* NMSA 1978, § 30-24-1 (1963) (bribing a public official is
a third degree felony). Seeking to avoid such absurdity, we turn to our
prior decisions to determine the meaning of "felony" as it is used in
the defense of habitation context.

{21} As noted above, the defendant in *Couch* was entitled to an
instruction on defense of habitation because he could have reasonably
believed that the people who were attacking his home intended violence
against its occupants. *See* 52 N.M. at 140, 193 P.2d at 412-13. Later,
in *Abeyta,* this Court held that the defendant did not qualify for a
defense of habitation instruction because, among other things, no
evidence had been presented that the victim "enter\[ed\] the house in
order to commit a felony involving violence." 120 N.M. at 244, 901 P.2d
at 175. Those authorities show that the term "felony" in the defense of
habitation context is properly limited to those felonies involving
violence. In other words, the felony that the defendant acted to prevent
must have been one that would have resulted in violence against the
occupants were it not\' prevented; in the event of any other felony, a
defense of habitation instruction would be unwarranted. *See Bailey,* 27
N.M. at 162-63, 198 P. at 534 ("\[I\]t is not true that a \[person\] may
kill another in his \[or her\] house when under the same circumstances
of danger, or apparent danger, to person or property, he \[or she\]
would not be justified in killing outside \[the\] house."); *see also
Pellegrino,* 577 N.W.2d at 596 ("\[P\]eople may defend their dwellings
against those who endeavor by violence to enter them and who appear to
intend violence to persons inside.").

{22} Because defense of habitation is not restricted to instances in
which the victim is killed inside the defendant's home, the trial court
in this case erred when it excluded the instruction on that ground.
Defendant would have been entitled to an instruction on the defense if
some evidence reasonably tended to show that he killed Victim to prevent
her from forcing entry into his home and committing a violent felony
once inside. Thus, the question we must now answer is whether, when
viewed in the light most favorable to giving the instruction, the
evidence supports that theory. We decide that it does not.

{23} Defendant asserts that the following evidence is enough to support
his theory that he had a reasonable belief that killing Victim was
necessary to prevent a felony from occurring within his home: (1) Victim
hated Defendant; (2) she knocked on the door to Defendant's home; (3)
she had threatened him with a gun in the past; (4) she was furious that
the couple was to be married the next day; and (5) she always carried a
loaded gun. Absent from that evidence is any demonstration that Victim
was "endeavorpng\] by violence to enter" his home or that she
"intend\[ed\] violence to persons inside." 40 C.J.S. *Homicide* § 164.
Assuming that Defendant reasonably believed that Victim intended to
commit a felony in his home, defense of habitation would have justified
his actions only if he could show that Victim was attempting to force
entry to his home. For example, if the evidence showed that Victim was
trying to break through Defendant's front door at the time he killed
her, defense of habitation would apply. However, under the facts of this
case, there is no evidence reasonably tending to support the theory that
Victim was attempting to force entry at the time Defendant killed her.
After knocking on the door, Victim had retreated some four feet from it
and was waiting for it to open. No evidence shows that, at the time she
was killed, Victim was attempting to gain entry to Defendant's home with
the intent to commit a violent felony therein.

{24} Defendant's argument seems to assert that he should have received
the instruction because he could have reasonably believed that Victim
was going to shoot him and then enter his home to continue the shooting.
While that theory justifies the instructions that Defendant received on
self defense, *see* UJI 14-5171 NMRA, and defense of another, *see* UJI
14-5172 NMRA, it does not give rise to an instruction on defense of
habitation because it does not allege any attempted forced entry on
Victim's part.

{25} Because there is no evidence to support the theory that Defendant
killed Victim in defense of his habitation, refusing the instruction was
not in error. Although the trial court erred in its reasons for denying
the instruction, the end result of its ruling was correct, and thus we
affirm. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

{37} Based on the forgoing analysis, we affirm Defendant's conviction.

People v. Goetz

 

New York Court of Appeals

68 N.Y.2d 96

1986-07-08

68 N.Y.2d 96 (1986)

### The People of the State of New York, Appellant, v. Bernhard Goetz, Respondent.

Court of Appeals of the State of New York.

Argued May 28, 1986.

Decided July 8, 1986.

**\[ ... \]**

Chief Judge WACHTLER.

A Grand Jury has indicted defendant on attempted murder, assault, and
other charges for having shot and wounded four youths on a New York City
subway train after one or two of the youths approached him and asked for
\$5. The lower courts, concluding that the prosecutor\'s charge to the
Grand Jury on the defense of justification was erroneous, have dismissed
the attempted murder, assault and weapons possession charges. We now
reverse and reinstate all counts of the indictment.

## I.

The precise circumstances of the incident giving rise to the charges
against defendant are disputed, and ultimately it will be for a trial
jury to determine what occurred. We feel it necessary, however, to
provide some factual background to \[100\] properly frame the legal
issues before us. Accordingly, we have summarized the facts as they
appear from the evidence before the Grand Jury. **\[ ... \]**

On Saturday afternoon, December 22, 1984, Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey,
James Ramseur, and Barry Allen boarded an IRT express subway train in
The Bronx and headed south toward lower Manhattan. **\[ ... \]** Two of
the four, Ramseur and Cabey, had screwdrivers inside their coats, which
they said were to be used to break into the coin boxes of video
machines.

Defendant Bernhard Goetz boarded this subway train **\[ ... \]** and sat
down on a bench towards the rear section of the same car occupied by the
four youths. Goetz was carrying an unlicensed .38 caliber pistol loaded
with five rounds of ammunition in a waistband holster. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Canty approached Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and
stated \"give me five dollars\". Neither Canty nor any of the other
youths displayed a weapon. Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out
his handgun and firing four shots in rapid succession. The first shot
hit Canty in the chest; the second struck Allen in the back; the third
went through Ramseur\'s arm and into his left side; the fourth was fired
at Cabey, who apparently was then standing in the corner of the car, but
missed, deflecting instead off of a wall of the conductor\'s cab. After
Goetz briefly surveyed the scene around him, he fired another shot at
Cabey, who then was sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet
entered the rear of Cabey\'s side and severed his spinal cord.

**\[ ... \]**Goetz told the conductor that the four youths had tried to
rob him.

While the conductor was aiding the youths, Goetz**\[ ... \]**jumped onto
the tracks and fled. **\[ ... \]** Ramseur and Canty, initially listed
in critical condition, have fully recovered. Cabey remains paralyzed,
and has suffered some degree of brain damage.

**\[ ... \]**Goetz admitted that he had been illegally carrying a
handgun in New York City for three years. He stated that he had first
purchased a gun in 1981 after he had been injured in a mugging. Goetz
also revealed that twice between 1981 and 1984 he had successfully
warded off assailants simply by displaying the pistol.

According to Goetz\'s statement, the first contact he had with the four
youths came when Canty, sitting or lying on the bench across from him,
asked \"how are you,\" to which he replied \"fine\". Shortly thereafter,
Canty, followed by one of the other youths, walked over to the defendant
and stood to his left, while the other two youths remained to his right,
in the corner of the subway car. Canty then said \"give me five
dollars\". Goetz stated that he knew from the smile on Canty\'s face
that they wanted to \"play with me\". Although he was certain that none
of the youths had a gun, he had a fear, based on prior experiences, of
being \"maimed\".

Goetz then established \"a pattern of fire,\" deciding specifically to
fire from left to right. His stated intention at that point was to
\"murder \[the four youths\], to hurt them, to make them suffer as much
as possible\". When Canty again requested money, Goetz stood up, drew
his weapon, and began firing, aiming for the center of the body of each
of the four. Goetz recalled that the first two he shot \"tried to run
through the crowd \[but\] they had nowhere to run\". Goetz then turned
to his right to \"go after the other two\". One of these two \"tried to
run through the wall of the train, but \* \* \* he had \[102\] nowhere
to go\". The other youth (Cabey) \"tried pretending that he wasn\'t with
\[the others\]\" by standing still, holding on to one of the subway hand
straps, and not looking at Goetz. Goetz nonetheless fired his fourth
shot at him. He then ran back to the first two youths to make sure they
had been \"taken care of\". Seeing that they had both been shot, he spun
back to check on the latter two. Goetz noticed that the youth who had
been standing still was now sitting on a bench and seemed unhurt. As
Goetz told the police, \"I said \`\[y\]ou seem to be all right, here\'s
another\'\", and he then fired the shot which severed Cabey\'s spinal
cord. Goetz added that \"if I was a little more under self-control \* \*
\* I would have put the barrel against his forehead and fired.\" He also
admitted that \"if I had had more \[bullets\], I would have shot them
again, and again, and again.\"

## II.

**\[ ... \]**

*\[The\]* Grand Jury filed a 10-count indictment, containing four
charges of attempted murder **\[ ... \]**, four charges of assault in
the first degree **\[ ... \]**, one charge of reckless endangerment in
the first degree **\[ ... \]**, and one charge of criminal possession of
a weapon in the second degree **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Goetz moved to dismiss the charges **\[ ... \]**
alleging**\[ ... \]**that the prosecutor\'s instructions to that Grand
Jury on the defense of justification were erroneous and prejudicial to
the defendant so as to render its proceedings defective **\[ ... \]**.

**\[ ... \]**

In an order dated January 21, 1986, *\[the trial court\]* granted
Goetz\'s motion **\[ ... \]**. The court, after inspection of the Grand
Jury minutes, **\[ ... \]** held**\[ ... \]** that the prosecutor**\[
... \]** had erroneously introduced an objective element into this
defense by instructing the grand jurors to consider whether Goetz\'s
conduct was that of a \"reasonable man in \[Goetz\'s\] situation\". The
court**\[ ... \]** concluded that the statutory test for whether the use
of deadly force is justified to protect a person should be wholly
subjective, focusing entirely on the defendant\'s state of mind when he
used such force. It concluded that dismissal was required for this error
because the justification issue was at the heart of the
case.[^\[2\]^](#X7bef0c5c7bd63d7e7dd9830431624c34230db5f)

**\[ ... \]**

On appeal by the People, a divided Appellate Division \[105\] affirmed
*\[the\]* dismissal of the charges. **\[ ... \]**

## III.

Penal Law article 35 recognizes the defense of justification, which
\"permits the use of force under certain circumstances\" **\[ ... \]**.
One such set of circumstances pertains to the use of force in defense of
a person, encompassing both self-defense and defense of a third person
(Penal Law § 35.15). Penal Law § 35.15 (1) sets forth the general
principles governing all such uses of force: \"\[a\] \[106\] person may
\* \* \* use physical force upon another person when and to the extent
he *reasonably believes* such to be necessary to defend himself or a
third person from what he *reasonably believes* to be the use or
imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person\" (emphasis
added).[^\[3\]^](#Xc56bac98d94f3d2d6ef65a14dbcf3648f3c9815)

Section 35.15 (2) sets forth further limitations on these general
principles with respect to the use of \"deadly physical force\": \"A
person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under
circumstances specified in subdivision one unless (a) He *reasonably
believes* that such other person is using or about to use deadly
physical force \* \*
\*[^\[4\]^](#Xc91880ee5a7abe0c6c7480d69588b0767dde02e) or (b) He
*reasonably believes* that such other person is committing or attempting
to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery\"
(emphasis added).

**\[ ... \]**

Because the evidence before the **\[ ... \]** Grand Jury included
statements by Goetz that he acted to protect himself from being maimed
or to avert a robbery, the prosecutor correctly chose to charge the
justification defense in section 35.15 to the Grand Jury**\[ ... \]**.

When the prosecutor had completed his charge, one of the grand jurors
asked for clarification of the term \"reasonably believes\". The
prosecutor responded by instructing the grand jurors that they were to
consider the circumstances of the incident and determine \"whether the
defendant\'s conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant\'s
situation\". It is this response by the prosecutor --- and specifically
his use of \"a reasonable man\" --- which is the basis for the dismissal
of the charges by the lower courts. As expressed repeatedly in the
Appellate Division\'s plurality opinion, because section 35.15 uses the
term *\"he* reasonably believes\", the appropriate test, according to
that court, is whether a defendant\'s beliefs and reactions were
\"reasonable *to him\"*. Under that reading of the statute, a jury which
believed a defendant\'s testimony that he felt that his own actions were
warranted and were reasonable would have to acquit him, regardless of
what anyone else in defendant\'s situation might have concluded. Such an
interpretation defies the ordinary meaning and significance of the term
\"reasonably\" in a statute, and misconstrues the clear intent of the
Legislature, in enacting section 35.15, to retain an objective element
as part of any provision authorizing the use of deadly physical force.

Penal statutes in New York have long codified the right recognized at
common law to use deadly physical force, under appropriate
circumstances, in self-defense **\[ ... \]**. These provisions have
never required that an actor\'s belief as to the intention of another
person to inflict serious injury be correct in order for the use of
deadly force to be justified, but they have uniformly required that the
belief comport with an objective notion of reasonableness. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In 1961 the Legislature established a Commission to undertake a complete
revision of the Penal Law and the Criminal Code. **\[ ... \]** The
drafting of the general provisions of the new Penal Law (*see*, Penal
Law part I), including the article on justification (*id.,* art 35), was
particularly influenced by the Model Penal Code **\[ ... \]**. While
using the Model Penal Code provisions on justification as general
guidelines, however, the drafters of the new Penal Law did not simply
adopt them verbatim.

**\[ ... \]**

New York did not follow the Model Penal Code\'s equation **\[ ... \]**
choosing instead to use a single statutory section which would provide
either a complete defense or no defense at all to a defendant charged
with any crime involving the use of deadly force. The drafters of the
new Penal Law adopted in large part the structure and content of Model
Penal Code § 3.04, but, crucially, inserted the word \"reasonably\"
before \"believes\".

The plurality below agreed with defendant\'s argument that the change in
the statutory language from \"reasonable ground,\" used prior to 1965,
to \"he reasonably believes\" in Penal Law § 35.15 evinced a legislative
intent to conform to the subjective standard contained in Model Penal
Code § 3.04. This argument, however, ignores the plain significance of
the \[111\] insertion of \"reasonably\". Had the drafters of section
35.15 wanted to adopt a subjective standard, they could have simply used
the language of section 3.04. \"Believes\" by itself requires an honest
or genuine belief by a defendant as to the need to use deadly force
(*see, e.g.*, Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses, *op. cit.* § 184 (b), at
399-400). Interpreting the statute to require only that the defendant\'s
belief was \"reasonable to *him,\"* as done by the plurality below,
would hardly be different from requiring only a genuine belief; in
either case, the defendant\'s own perceptions could completely exonerate
him from any criminal liability.

We cannot lightly impute to the Legislature an intent to fundamentally
alter the principles of justification to allow the perpetrator of a
serious crime to go free simply because that person believed his actions
were reasonable and necessary to prevent some perceived harm. To
completely exonerate such an individual, no matter how aberrational or
bizarre his thought patterns, would allow citizens to set their own
standards for the permissible use of force. It would also allow a
legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill or perform
acts of violence with impunity, contrary to fundamental principles of
justice and criminal law.

We can only conclude that the Legislature retained a reasonableness
requirement to avoid giving a license for such actions. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Goetz also argues that the introduction of an objective element will
preclude a jury from considering factors such as the prior experiences
of a given actor and thus, require it to make a determination of
\"reasonableness\" without regard to the actual circumstances of a
particular incident. This argument, however, falsely presupposes that an
objective standard means that the background and other relevant
characteristics of a particular actor must be ignored. To the contrary,
we have frequently noted that a determination of reasonableness must be
based on the \"circumstances\" facing a defendant or his \"situation\"
*(see, e.g.*, *People v Ligouri*, 284 N.Y. 309, 316, *supra;* *People v
Lumsden*, 201 N.Y. 264, 268, *supra).* Such terms encompass more than
the physical movements of the potential assailant. As just discussed,
these terms include any relevant knowledge the defendant had about that
person. They also necessarily bring in the physical attributes of all
persons involved, including the defendant. Furthermore, the defendant\'s
circumstances encompass any prior experiences he had which could provide
a reasonable basis for a belief that another person\'s intentions were
to injure or rob him or that the use of deadly force was necessary under
the circumstances.

**\[ ... \]**

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and
the dismissed counts of the indictment reinstated.

Notes & Questions (People v.Goetz)

 

By Cydney Chilimidos and Zachary Nemirovsky

**Notes & Questions**

1\. *Who are the Goetz Victims?* For a little context regarding who the
victims of the Goetz case are, check out this [12 minute
story](https://themoth.org/stories/the-birthday-present) told by Brock
Grant, a friend of the victims. Grant speaks on the plans the five
youths had made that day and how the tragedy unfolded, profoundly
impacting his life.

2\. *Aftermath.* With the reinstatement of the indictment, Goetz went to
trial. The jury was composed of eight men and four women, ten whites and
two African-Americans. The jury acquitted Goetz of all charges except
for the possession of a concealed weapon, for which he received a
one-year jail sentence. Goetz was released from jail after eight months.

     In 1996, during a civil suit by Darrel Cabey (who was permanently
paralyzed in the shooting) a six-member civil jury, with four
African-Americans and two Hispanics, found Goetz liable and ordered a
payment of 18 million dollars in compensatory damages and 25 million
dollars in punitive damages. Goetz, however, declared bankruptcy and
never paid. [In 2017, he was still living in the same apartment on 14th
Street as he was back in the
1980s](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/trial-by-media-where-is-bernhard-hugo-goetz-now-47460750).

     Episode two of the Netflix docuseries *Trial By Media* covers these
events.

3\. *Reasonable Belief.* The court makes clear that the "reasonable
belief" standard is an objective one, and yet simultaneously clarifies
that the objective standard "must be based on the 'circumstances' facing
a defendant or his 'situation.'" In your view, do any of the following
matter in determining whether a reasonable person would have believed
they were in serious danger: (1) if two of the youths were armed with
screwdrivers, of which Goetz had no knowledge; (2) that Goetz had
previously been mugged; (3) the clothing that the youths were wearing
(for example, suits and ties as opposed to clothing identified with
gangs); (4) that one of them said, "give me five dollars"; (5) that
Goetz was a middle-aged white male; and (6) that the victims were young,
African-American males?

4\. *Race - An Implicit or Explicit Role?* Should race play an explicit
factor in whether a reasonable person would believe themselves to be in
danger? Whether or not it should, it often plays at least an *implicit*
factor.

     For example, in the criminal trial of Goetz, race was never
explicitly mentioned during the trial.^1^ Goetz's attorney instead
appealed to the "Black-as-criminal" stereotype in a covert manner, such
as by referring to the four victims as "savages," "predators,"
"vultures," and a "gang of four."^2^ When re-creating the subway
shooting for the jury, Goetz's attorney also used implicit racial bias
by having four young, fit, large, muscular Black men, dressed in
T-shirts, play the parts of the victims.^3^ In *Goetz*, the jury
instructions did not mention race as a factor for reasonableness.

     By contrast, consider the civil suit between Goetz and Cabey.^4^
Although issues of race and racism were never directly argued at the
criminal trial, they were explicitly explored in the civil case.^5^ By
using character evidence of racism, the attorneys for Cabey were able to
paint a picture of the motivations underlying Goetz's attack, and
thereby counterbalance the defense's appeals to racial stereotypes. The
civil case thus painted a very different picture of the events
surrounding the subway shooting precisely *because* race was made
explicit, rather than avoided.

5\. *Reasonable Racism?* Can racism ever be reasonable in the context of
self-defense? Consider the excerpt from the following article, [*Race
Ipsa Loquitur: Of Reasonable Racists, Intelligent Bayesians, and
Involuntary
Negrophobes*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I1dc0804136e411db8382aef8d8e33c97/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
by Jody D. Armour.

            The Reasonable Racist asserts that, even if his belief that
blacks are "prone to violence" stems from pure prejudice, he should be
excused for considering the victim's race before using force because
most similarly situated Americans would have done so as well. \* \* \*

With regard to his claim that average Americans share his fear of black
violence, the Reasonable Racist can point to evidence such as a 1990
University of Chicago study which found that over 56 percent of
Americans consciously believe that blacks tend to be "violence prone."
Moreover, numerous recent news stories chronicle the widespread
exclusion of blacks from shops and taxicabs by anxious storekeepers and
cabdrivers, many of whom openly admit to making race-based assessments
of the danger posed by prospective patrons. \* \* \* \[I\]t is
unrealistic to dispute the depressing conclusion that, for many
Americans, crime has a black face.

The flaw in the Reasonable Racist's self-defense claim lies in his
primary assumption that the sole objective of criminal law is to punish
those who deviate from statistically defined norms. \* \* \* The
reasonableness inquiry, however, extends beyond typicality to consider
the social interests implicated in a given situation. Hence not all
"typical" beliefs are per se reasonable. \* \* \*

\* \* \* With respect to race, prevailing beliefs and attitudes may fall
short of what we can fairly expect of people from the standpoint of \*
\* \* "social morality." If we accept that racial discrimination
violates contemporary social morality, then an actor's failure to
overcome his racism for the sake of another's health, safety, and
personal dignity is blameworthy and thus unreasonable, independent of
whether or not it is "typical." \* \* \*

A second argument which a defendant may advance to justify acting on
race-based assumptions is that, given statistics demonstrating blacks'
disproportionate involvement in crime, it is reasonable to perceive a
greater threat from a black person than a white person. Walter Williams,
a conservative black economist, refers to such an individual an
"Intelligent Bayesian," named for Sir Thomas Bayes, the father of
statistics. \* \* \* While the Reasonable Racist explicitly admits his
prejudice and bases his claim for exoneration on the prevalence of
racial animus, the Intelligent Bayesian invokes the "objectivity" of
numbers. \* \* \*

Even if we accept the Bayesian's claim that his greater fear of blacks
results wholly from his unbiased analysis of crime statistics, biases in
the criminal justice system undermine the reliability of the statistics
themselves. A *Harvard Law Review* survey of race and the criminal
process, for example, found that "\[a\]n examination of empirical
studies suggests \* \* \* that racial discrimination by police officers
in choosing whom to arrest most likely causes arrest statistics to
exaggerate what differences might exist in crime patterns between blacks
and whites, thus making any reliance on arrest patterns misplaced." \*
\* \*

To the extent that socioeconomic status explains the overinvolvement of
blacks in robbery and assault (assuming that there is, in fact, such
overinvolvement), race serves merely as a proxy for socioeconomic
status. But if race is a proxy for socioeconomic factors, then race
loses its predictive value when one controls for those factors. Thus, if
an individual is walking through an impoverished, "crime-prone
neighborhood," \* \* \* and if he has already weighed the character of
the neighborhood in judging the dangerousness of his situation, then it
is illogical for him to consider the racial identity of the person whose
suspicious footsteps he hears. For he has already taken into account the
socioeconomic factors for which race is a proxy, and considering the
racial identity of the ambiguous person under such circumstances
constitutes \* \* \* "doublecounting." \* \* \*

\* \* \* And surely a paragon of rational thinking like the Intelligent
Bayesian would not press for the admission of evidence that subverts the
rationality of the factfinding process. \* \* \*

\* \* \* In contrast to both the "Reasonable Racist" (whose fear of
blacks stems from and is reinforced by the mass media and traditional
racial myths) and the "Intelligent Bayesian" (whose racial fears rest on
crime statistics), \[is a\] fear emerg\[ing\] after a violent personal
assault. To what extent, then, should such "involuntary negrophobia" be
relevant to claims of self-defense?

\* \* \* The doctrinal foundation of the negrophobe's claim is the
widely accepted "subjective" test of reasonableness, which takes into
account both the defendant's past experiences and the psychological
effects of those experiences. Under this standard of reasonableness, the
factfinder compares the defendant's judgments not to those of a typical
person drawn from the general population, but to those of a person in
the situation of the defendant. The defendant's "situation" \* \* \*
includes not only the immediate circumstances of the fatal encounter,
but also the psychological effects of experiences that she has undergone
prior to the fatal encounter. Thus, as long as a "typical" person could
develop the same misperceptions as did the defendant under exposure to
the same external forces, the defendant's misperceptions will be found
reasonable.\* \* \*

\* \* \* \[But, we ought to be\] concerned \* \* \* were the courts to
sanction the claim that race-based fear can be so involuntary as to
provide a basis of exculpation. To accept such a claim, the courts would
have to equate racism with recognized judgment-impairing
conditions\--such as insanity and youthfulness\--which, when
successfully invoked, justify a "not guilty determination." \* \* \*

\* \* \* Blacks, already concerned with a perceived dual standard
operating in the court system, would justifiably perceive the courts'
crediting of such claims as the advent of a new legal loophole
potentially enabling racists to express their venomous prejudices
without consequence. Furthermore, to the extent that the legal system
signals to either reasonable or "pathological" racists that they may act
without fear of serious consequences, it may ultimately inhibit blacks'
full participation in society.

5\. *The Result for Communities of Color.* Consider the following
excerpt on what acknowledging racism as an acceptable reason for
self-defense perpetuates. *It's Ten O'clock and I Worry About Where My
Husband Is, Glamour* by Rosemary L. Bray.

He phoned more than an hour ago, to say he was on his way home. But I
have yet to hear the scrape of the iron gate, the rattling keys, so I
worry.

Most married women fret about a tardy husband; young black women like
myself worry more. For most people in New York---truth be told---the
urban bogeyman is a young black man in sneakers. But we live in Central
Harlem, where every young man is black and wears sneakers, so we learn
to look into the eyes of young males and discern the difference between
youthful bravado and the true dangers of the streets. No, I have other
fears. I fear white men in police uniforms; white teenagers driving by
in a car with Jersey plates; thin panicky, middle-aged white men on the
subway. Most of all, I fear that their path and my husband's path will
cross one night as he makes his way home.

Bob is tall---5′10″ or so, dark, with thick hair and wire-rimmed
glasses. He carries a knapsack stuffed with work from the office, old
crossword puzzles, Philip Glass tapes, Ebony Man and People magazines.
When it rains, he carries his good shoes in the bag and wears his Reebok
sneakers. He cracks his knuckles a lot, and wears a peculiar grimace
when his mind is elsewhere. He looks dear and gentle to me---but then, I
have looked into those eyes for a long time.

I worry that some white person will see that grim, focused look of
concentration and see the intent to victimize. I fear that some white
person will look at him and see only his or her nightmare---another
black man in sneakers. In fact, my husband is another black man in
sneakers. He's also a writer, an amateur cyclist, a lousy basketball
player, his parents' son, my life's companion. When I put aside the book
I'm reading to peek out the window, the visions in my head are those of
blind white panic at my husband's black presence, visions of a flashing
gun, a gleaming knife: I see myself a sudden, horrified widow at
thirty-four.

Once upon a time, I was vaguely ashamed of my paranoia about his safety
in the world outside our home. After all, he is a grown man. But he is a
grown black man on the streets alone, a menace to white New
Yorkers---even the nice, sympathetic, liberal ones who smile at us when
we're together. And I am reminded, over and over, how dangerous white
people still can be, how their fears are a hazard to our health. When
white people are ruled by their fears of everything black, every black
woman is an addict, a whore; every black man is a rapist---even a
murderer. \* \* \*

So when it's ten o'clock and he's not home yet, my thoughts can't help
but wander to other black men---husbands, fathers, sons, brothers---who
never do make it home, and to other black women whose fingers no longer
rest at a curtain's edge. Even after I hear the scrape of our iron gate,
the key in the lock, even after I hear that old knapsack hit the floor
of the downstairs hallway and Bob's voice calling to me, my thoughts
return to them.^6^

6\. *Another Vigilante Killing*. In 2012, George Zimmerman shot and
killed Trayvon Martin. All of the facts that follow are taken from an
[archive of the
trial](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zimmerman1/zimmermanaccount.html).
Martin, a 17-year-old African American teen, was wandering a rainy
neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, talking on the phone to a friend from
Miami. George Zimmerman lived in the neighborhood, and had started a
"neighborhood watch" program after a series of burglaries.

     Zimmerman saw Martin around the neighborhood, and phoned 9-1-1.
When told that an officer was on their way, Zimmerman replied "\"These
assholes, they always get away.\" When Martin began leaving, Zimmerman
followed him in his car, despite the dispatcher saying "we don\'t need
you to do that.\" An altercation followed, with Zimmerman claiming he
was knocked to the ground, that Martin was on top of him and killing
him. A neighbor heard cries of help and called 9-1-1, and on the
recording cries of "Help! Help! Help!" can be heard. Martin's phone had
also been dropped during the altercation, and before it cut off, his
friend told a different story - saying she could clearly hear that
Martin (not Zimmerman) was yelling "Get off, get off!" before the phone
shut off.

     Ultimately, Zimmerman shot Martin with his gun, telling jurors that
he thought Martin had been reaching for it. At first, the Sanford police
closed the case as one of self-defense, until public outcry reignited
the investigation. "On March 22, Sanford police chief Bill Lee was
placed on paid leave.  The following day, State attorney Angela Corey,
appointed by Florida Governor Rick Scott as a special prosecutor, began
an independent review of the evidence." This eventually led to the clear
showing that Zimmerman's pursuit of Martin, if nothing else, was
racially motivated, and led to a trial.

     The jury consisted of six women, five white and one who identified
as hispanic. At trial, Zimmerman was acquitted. What happened? Lisa
Bloom, a trial attorney and NBC News analyst who covered the murder
trial, wrote that the State of Florida lost a "winnable." Among other
things, she noted that the prosecution should have pushed back on claims
such as that Martin was "going for" Zimmerman's gun, which was holstered
to his backside and would have been under him if he were truly pinned to
the ground.

     Perhaps most importantly, she said that the prosecution erred by
attempting \"to stay a million miles away\" from the \"race issue.\"^7^
The defense "comfortably handled the race issue," while the prosecution
"had the responsibility to undermine the outrageous association of
Trayvon with two \[African-American\] burglars he'd never met" but
"entirely failed to do so."^8^

State v. Norman

 

North Carolina Court of Appeals

89 N.C. App. 384

No. 8729SC676

1988-04-05

**\[ ... \]**

PARKER, Judge.

**\[ ... \]**The primary issue presented on this appeal is whether the
trial court erred in failing to instruct on self-defense. We answer in
the affirmative and grant a new trial.

Facts

At trial the State presented the testimony of a deputy sheriff **\[ ...
\]**who testified that **\[ ... \]** he was dispatched to the Norman
residence. There, in one of the bedrooms, he found decedent, John Thomas
"J.T." Norman (herein decedent or Norman) dead, lying on his left side
on a bed. The State presented an autopsy report, stipulated to by both
parties, concluding that Norman had died from two gunshot wounds to the
head. The deputy sheriff also testified that **\[ ... \]** defendant
told the officer that decedent, her husband, had been beating her all
day, that she went to her mother's house nearby and got a .25 automatic
pistol, that she returned to her house and loaded the gun, and that she
shot her husband*\[while he slept\].***\[ ... \]**

Defendant's evidence, presented through several different witnesses,
disclosed a long history of verbal and physical abuse leveled by
decedent against defendant. Defendant and Norman had been married
twenty-five years at the time of Norman's death. Norman was an
alcoholic. He had begun to drink and to beat defendant five years after
they were married. The couple had five children, four of whom are still
living. When defendant was pregnant with her youngest child, Norman beat
her and kicked her down a flight of steps, causing the baby to be born
prematurely the next day.

Norman, himself, had worked one day a few months prior to his death; but
aside from that one day, witnesses could not remember his ever working.
Over the years and up to the time of his death, Norman forced defendant
to prostitute herself every day in order to support him. **\[ ... \]**

Norman commonly called defendant "Dogs," "Bitches," and "Whores," and
referred to her as a dog. Norman beat defendant "most every day,"**\[
... \]** Defendant exhibited to the jury scars on her face from these
incidents. Norman would often make defendant bark like a dog, and if she
refused, he would beat her. He often forced defendant to sleep on the
concrete floor of their home and on several occasions forced her to eat
dog or cat food out of the dog or cat bowl.

Norman often stated both to defendant and to others that he would kill
defendant. He also threatened to cut her heart out.

Witnesses for the defense also testified to the events in the thirty-six
hours prior to Norman's death. On or about the morning of 10 June 1985,
Norman forced defendant to go to a truck stop or rest stop on Interstate
85 in order to prostitute to make some money. **\[ ... \]** Some time
later that day, Norman went to the truck stop, apparently drunk, and
began hitting defendant in the face with his fist and slamming the car
door into her. He also threw hot coffee on defendant. On the way home,
Norman's car was stopped by police, and he was arrested for driving
under the influence.

When Norman was released from jail the next morning, on 11 June 1985, he
was extremely angry and beat defendant. Defendant's mother said
defendant acted nervous and scared. Defendant testified that during the
entire day, when she was near him, her husband slapped her, and when she
was away from him, he threw glasses, ashtrays, and beer bottles at her.
**\[ ... \]**

On the evening of 11 June 1985, at about 8:00 or 8:30 p.m., a domestic
quarrel was reported at the Norman residence. The officer responding to
the call testified that defendant was bruised and crying and that she
stated her husband had been beating her all day and she could not take
it any longer. The officer advised defendant to take out a warrant on
her husband, but defendant responded that if she did so, he would kill
her. A short time later, the officer was again dispatched to the Norman
residence. There he learned that defendant had taken an overdose of
"nerve pills," and that Norman was interfering with emergency personnel
who were trying to treat defendant. Norman was drunk and was making
statements such as, " 'If you want to die, you deserve to die. I'll give
you more pills,' " and " 'Let the bitch die \... . She ain't nothing but
a dog. She don't deserve to live.' " Norman also threatened to kill
defendant, defendant's mother, and defendant's grandmother. **\[ ...
\]** Defendant was taken to Rutherford Hospital.

The therapist on call at the hospital that night stated that defendant
was angry and depressed and that she felt her situation was hopeless. On
the advice of the therapist, defendant did not return home that night,
but spent the night at her grandmother's house.

The next day, 12 June 1985, the day of Norman's death, Norman was
angrier and more violent with defendant than usual. According to
witnesses, Norman beat defendant all day long. **\[ ... \]**

Later that day, one of the Normans' daughters, Loretta, reported to
defendant's mother that her father was beating her mother again.
Defendant's mother called the sheriffs department, but no help arrived
at that time. Witnesses stated that back at the Norman residence, Norman
threatened to cut defendant's throat, threatened to kill her, and
threatened to cut off her breast. **\[ ... \]**

In the late afternoon, Norman wanted to take a nap. He lay down on the
larger of the two beds in the bedroom. Defendant started to lie down on
the smaller bed, but Norman said, " 'No bitch . . . Dogs don't sleep on
beds, they sleep in \[sic\] the floor.' " Soon after, one of the
Normans' daughters, Phyllis, came into the room and asked if defendant
could look after her baby. Norman assented. When the baby began to cry,
defendant took the child to her mother's house, fearful that the baby
would disturb Norman. At her mother's house, defendant found a gun. She
took it back to her home and shot Norman.

Defendant testified that things at home were so bad she could no longer
stand it. She explained that she could not leave Norman because he would
kill her. She stated that she had left him before on several occasions
and that each time he found her, took her home, and beat her. She said
that she was afraid to take out a warrant on her husband because he had
said that if she ever had him locked up, he would kill her when he got
out. She stated she did not have him committed because he told her he
would see the authorities coming for him and before they got to him he
would cut defendant's throat. Defendant also testified that when he
threatened to kill her, she believed he would kill her if he had the
chance.

The defense presented the testimony of two expert witnesses in the field
of forensic psychology, Dr. William Tyson and Dr. Robert Rollins. Based
on an examination of defendant and an investigation of the matter, Dr.
Tyson concluded that defendant "fits and exceeds the profile, of an
abused or battered spouse." Dr. Tyson explained that in defendant's case
the situation had progressed beyond mere " 'Wife battering or family
violence' " and had become "torture, degradation and reduction to an
animal level of existence, where all behavior was marked purely by
survival . . . Dr. Tyson stated that defendant could not leave her
husband because she had gotten to the point where she had no belief
whatsoever in herself and believed in the total invulnerability of her
husband. He stated, "Mrs. Norman didn't leave because she believed,
fully believed that escape was totally impossible. . . . She fully
believed that \[Norman\] was invulnerable to the law and to all social
agencies that were available; that nobody could withstand his power. As
a result, there was no such thing as escape." Dr. Tyson stated that the
incidences of Norman forcing defendant to perform prostitution and to
eat pet food from pet dishes were parts of the dehumanization process.
Dr. Tyson analogized the process to practices in prisoner-of-war camps
in the Second World War and the Korean War.

When asked if it appeared to defendant reasonably necessary to kill her
husband, Dr. Tyson responded, "I think Judy Norman felt that she had no
choice, both in the protection of herself and her family, but to engage,
exhibit deadly force against Mr. Norman, and that in so doing, she was
sacrificing herself, both for herself and for her family."

Dr. Rollins was defendant's attending physician at Dorothea Dix Hospital
where she was sent for a psychiatric evaluation after her arrest. Based
on an examination of defendant, laboratory studies, psychological tests,
interviews, and background investigation, Dr. Rollins testified that
defendant suffered from "abused spouse syndrome." Dr. Rollins defined
the syndrome in the following way:

> The "abused spouse syndrome" refers to situations where one spouse has
> achieved almost complete control and submission of the other by both
> psychological and physical domination. It's, to start with, it's
> usually seen in the females who do not have a strong sense of their
> own adequacy who do not have a lot of personal or occupational
> resources; it's usually associated with physical abuse over a long
> period of time, and the particular characteristics that interest us
> are that the abused spouse comes to believe that the other person is
> in complete control; that they themselves are worthless and they
> cannot get away; that there's no rescue from the other person.

When asked, in his opinion, whether it appeared reasonably necessary
that defendant take the life of J. T. Norman, Dr. Rollins responded, "In
my opinion, that course of action did appear necessary to Mrs.
Norman."**\[ ... \]**

Legal Analysis

**\[ ... \]**

The question then arising on the facts in this case is whether the
victim's passiveness at the moment the *\[killing\]* act occurred
precludes defendant from asserting **\[ ... \]** self-defense.

Applying the criteria of **\[ ... \]** self-defense to the facts of this
case, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to submit an issue of
**\[ ... \]**self-defense to the jury. An examination of the elements of
**\[ ... \]** self-defense reveals that both subjective and objective
standards are to be applied in making the crucial determinations. The
first requirement that it appear to defendant and that defendant believe
it necessary to kill the deceased in order to save herself from death or
great bodily harm calls for a subjective evaluation. This evaluation
inquires as to what the defendant herself perceived at the time of the
shooting. The trial was replete with testimony of forced prostitution,
beatings, and threats on defendant's life. The defendant testified that
she believed the decedent would kill her, and the evidence showed that
on the occasions when she had made an effort to get away from Norman, he
had come after her and beat her. **\[ ... \]** Both experts testified
that in their opinion, defendant believed killing the victim was
necessary to avoid being killed. This evidence would permit a finding by
a jury that defendant believed it necessary to kill the victim to save
herself from death or serious bodily harm.

Unlike the first requirement, the second element of self-defense ---
that defendant's belief be reasonable **\[ ... \]** --- is measured by
the objective standard of the person of ordinary firmness under the same
circumstances. Again, the record is replete with sufficient evidence to
permit but not compel a juror, representing the person of ordinary
firmness, to infer that defendant's belief was reasonable under the
circumstances in which she found herself. Both expert witnesses
testified that defendant exhibited severe symptoms of battered spouse
syndrome, a condition that develops from repeated cycles of violence by
the victim against the defendant. Through this repeated, sometimes
constant, abuse, the battered spouse acquires what the psychologists
denote as a state of "learned helplessness," defendant's state of mind
as described by Drs. Tyson and Rollins. **\[ ... \]**The inability of a
defendant to withdraw from the hostile situation and the vulnerability
of a defendant to the victim are factors considered **\[ ... \]** in
determining the reasonableness of a defendant's belief in the necessity
to kill the victim. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** Psychologists and sociologists report that battered spouse
syndrome usually has three phases --- the tension-building phase, the
violent phase, and the quiet or loving phase. **\[ ... \]** During the
violent phase, the time when the traditional concept of self-defense
would mandate that defendant protect herself, *ie.,* at the moment the
abusing spouse attacks, the battered spouse is least able to counter
because she is immobilized by fear, if not actually physically
restrained.**\[ ... \]**

Mindful that the law should never casually permit an otherwise unlawful
killing of another human being to be justified or excused, this Court is
of the opinion that with the battered spouse there can be, under certain
circumstances, a**\[ ... \]** killing of a passive victim that does not
preclude **\[ ... \]** self-defense. Given the characteristics of
battered spouse syndrome, we do not believe that a battered person must
wait until a deadly attack occurs or that the victim must in all cases
be actually attacking or threatening to attack at the very moment
defendant commits the unlawful act for the battered person to act in
self-defense. Such a standard, in our view, would ignore the realities
of the condition. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**Based on this evidence, a jury, in our view, could find
that decedent's sleep was but a momentary hiatus in a continuous reign
of terror by the decedent, that defendant merely took advantage of her
first opportunity to protect herself, and that defendant's act was not
without the provocation required for **\[ ... \]**self-defense.

Finally, the expert testimony considered with the other evidence would
permit reasonable minds to infer that defendant did not use more force
than reasonably appeared necessary to her under the circumstances to
protect herself from death or great bodily harm.

State v. Norman

 

378 S.E.2d 8 (1989)

324 N.C. 253

### STATE of North Carolina v. Judy Ann Laws NORMAN.

No. 161PA88.

Supreme Court of North Carolina.

April 5, 1989.

 

**\[ ... \]**

MITCHELL, Justice.

**\[ ... \]**

The Court of Appeals granted a new trial, citing as error the trial
court\'s refusal to submit a possible verdict of acquittal by reason of
**\[ ... \]** self-defense. Notwithstanding the uncontroverted evidence
that the defendant shot her husband three times in the back of the head
as he lay sleeping in his bed, the Court of Appeals held that the
defendant\'s evidence that she exhibited what has come to be called
\"the battered wife syndrome\" entitled her to have the jury consider
whether the homicide was an act of **\[ ... \]**self-defense and, thus,
not a legal wrong.

We conclude that the evidence introduced in this case would not support
a finding that the defendant killed her husband due to a reasonable fear
of imminent death or great bodily harm, as is required before a
defendant is entitled to jury instructions concerning **\[ ... \]**
self-defense. Therefore, the trial court properly declined to instruct
the jury on the law relating to self-defense. Accordingly, we reverse
the Court of Appeals.

**\[ ... \]**

The right to kill in self-defense is based on the necessity, real or
reasonably apparent, of killing an unlawful aggressor to save oneself
from *imminent* death or great bodily harm at his hands. ***\[ ... \]***
Our law has recognized that self-preservation under such circumstances
springs from a primal impulse and is an inherent right of natural law.
***\[ ... \]***

**\[ ... \]**

The killing of another human being is the most extreme recourse to our
inherent right of self-preservation and can be justified in law only by
the utmost real or apparent necessity brought about by the decedent. For
that reason, our law of self-defense has required that a defendant
claiming that a homicide was justified **\[ ... \]**establish that she
reasonably believed at the time of the killing she otherwise would have
immediately suffered death or great bodily harm. Only if defendants are
required to show that they killed due to a reasonable belief that death
or great bodily harm was imminent can the justification for homicide
remain clearly and firmly rooted in necessity. The imminence requirement
ensures that deadly force will be used only where it is necessary as a
last resort in the exercise of the inherent right of self-preservation.
**\[ ... \]**

The term \"imminent,\" as used to describe such perceived threats of
death or great bodily harm as will justify a homicide by reason of**\[
... \]** self-defense, has been defined as \"immediate danger, such as
must be instantly met, such as cannot be guarded against by calling for
the assistance of others or the protection of the law.\" Black\'s Law
Dictionary 676 (5th ed. 1979). **\[ ... \]**

The evidence in this case did not tend to show that the defendant
reasonably believed that she was confronted by a threat of imminent
death or great bodily harm. The evidence tended to show that no harm was
\"imminent\" or about to happen to the defendant when she shot her
husband. The uncontroverted evidence was that her husband had been
asleep for some time when she walked to her mother\'s house, returned
with the pistol, fixed the pistol after it jammed and then shot her
husband three times in the back of the head. The defendant was not faced
with an instantaneous choice between killing her husband or being killed
or seriously injured. Instead, *all* of the evidence tended to show that
the defendant had ample time and opportunity to resort to other means of
preventing further abuse by her husband. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Additionally, the lack of any belief by the defendant---reasonable or
otherwise---that she faced a threat of imminent death or great bodily
harm from the drunk and sleeping victim in the present case was
illustrated by**\[ ... \]**her own expert witnesses when testifying
about her subjective assessment of her situation at the time of the
killing. **\[ ... \]**

Dr. Tyson **\[ ... \]** testified that the defendant \"believed herself
to be doomed\... to a life of the worst kind of torture and abuse,
degradation that she had experienced over the years in a progressive
way; that it would only get worse, and that death was inevitable.\" Such
evidence of the defendant\'s speculative beliefs concerning her remote
and indefinite future, while indicating she had felt generally
threatened, did not tend to show that she killed in the
belief---reasonable or otherwise---that her husband presented a threat
of *imminent* death or great bodily harm. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

We are not persuaded by the reasoning of our Court of Appeals in this
case that when there is evidence of battered wife syndrome, neither an
actual attack nor threat of attack by the husband at the moment the wife
uses deadly force is required to justify the wife\'s killing of him in
**\[ ... \]**self-defense. The Court of Appeals concluded that to impose
such requirements \[15\] would ignore the \"learned helplessness,\"
meekness and other realities of battered wife syndrome and would
effectively preclude such women from exercising their right of
self-defense. **\[ ... \]**Other jurisdictions which have addressed this
question under similar facts are divided in their views, and we can
discern no clear majority position on facts closely similar to those of
this case. ***\[ ... \]***

**\[ ... \]**

*\[Stretching\]* the law of self-defense to fit the facts of this case
would require changing the \"imminent death or great bodily harm\"
requirement to something substantially more indefinite than previously
required and would weaken our assurances that justification for the
taking of human life remains firmly rooted in real or apparent
necessity. That result in principle could not be limited to a few cases
decided on evidence as poignant as this. The relaxed requirements **\[
... \]** proposed by our Court of Appeals would tend to categorically
legalize the opportune killing of abusive husbands by their wives solely
on the basis of the wives\' testimony concerning their subjective
speculation as to the probability of future felonious assaults by their
husbands. Homicidal self-help would then become a lawful solution, and
perhaps the easiest and most effective solution, to this problem. ***\[
... \]***

**\[ ... \]**

REVERSED.

MARTIN, Justice, dissenting.

At the outset it is to be noted that the peril of fabricated evidence is
not unique to the trials of battered wives who kill. The possibility of
invented evidence arises in all cases in which a party is seeking the
benefit of self-defense. Moreover, in this case there were a number of
witnesses other than defendant who testified as to the actual presence
of circumstances supporting a claim of self-defense. This record
contains no reasonable basis to attack the credibility of evidence for
the defendant.

**\[ ... \]**

Defendant does not seek to expand or relax the requirements of
self-defense and thereby \"legalize the opportune killing of allegedly
abusive husbands by their wives,\" as the majority overstates. **\[ ...
\]**The proper issue for this Court is to determine whether the
evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, was
sufficient to require the trial court to instruct on the law of
self-defense. I conclude that it was.

**\[ ... \]**

Evidence presented by defendant described a twenty-year history of
beatings and other dehumanizing and degrading treatment by her husband.
In his expert testimony a clinical psychologist **\[ ... \]**described
the defendant as a woman incarcerated by abuse, by fear, and by her
conviction that her husband was invincible and inescapable**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**This, in fact, is a state of mind common to the battered
spouse, and one that dramatically distinguishes Judy Norman\'s belief in
the imminence of serious harm from that asserted by *\[other kinds of
defendants\].***\[ ... \]** For the battered wife, if there is no
escape, if there is no window of relief or momentary sense of safety,
then the next attack, which could be the fatal one, is imminent. In the
context of the doctrine of self-defense, \"imminent\" is a term the
meaning of which must be grasped from the defendant\'s point of view.
Properly stated,**\[ ... \]**the question is not whether the threat was
*in fact* imminent, but whether defendant\'s belief in the impending
nature of the threat, given the circumstances as she saw them, was
reasonable in the mind of a person of ordinary
firmness.[^\[1\]^](#X2acd243c754630d627e9e97ec35b52899f957ee)

Defendant\'s intense fear**\[ ... \]**was evident in the testimony of
witnesses who recounted events of the last three days of the decedent\'s
life. This testimony could have led a juror to conclude that defendant
reasonably perceived a threat to her life as \"imminent,\" even while
her husband slept. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In *State v. Wingler,* **\[ ... \]** in which the defendant was found
guilty for the murder of his wife, Justice **\[ ... \]** Stacy
recognized the pain and oppression under which a woman suffers at the
hands of an abusive husband: \"The supreme tragedy of life is the
immolation of woman. With a heavy hand, nature exacts from her a high
tax of blood and tears.\" *Id.* at 751, 115 S.E. at 61. By his barbaric
conduct over the course of twenty years, J.T. Norman reduced the quality
of the defendant\'s life to such an abysmal state that, given the
opportunity to do so, the jury might well have found that she was
justified in acting in self-defense for the preservation of her tragic
life.

Notes & Questions (State v. Norman)

 

By Cydney Chilimidos and Zachary Nemirovsky

**Notes & Questions**

1\. *The Norman Trial and its Aftermath:* When asked why Judy Norman
killed her husband, she told the court:

"Because I was scared of him and I knowed when he woke up, it was going
to be the same thing, and I was scared when he took me to the truck stop
that night it was going to be worse than he had ever been. I just
couldn't take it no more. There ain't no way \[crying\], even if it
means going to prison. It's better than living in that. That's worse
hell than anything \[crying\]."^1^

     Norman was subsequently covicted of manslaughter and sentenced to
prison for six years. After the trial, attorney Robert Wolf collected
several thousand signatures on a petition for clemency, which he
submitted to the Governor of North Carolina, James T. Martin. Norman was
in prison for two months when [Governor Martin commuted her
sentence](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/law_review/422) to time served.

2\. *More on Battered Spouse Syndrome*: According to Sue Osthoff & Holly
Maguigan:

"Over the years, experiences in criminal courts \[have\] persuaded
advocates, lawyers, and researchers to move beyond the "battered woman
syndrome" formulation to more comprehensive testimony. They came to
understand that BWS fails to capture the full experience of battered
women, and that its risks subjecting women who are battered to labels
that deny their diversity and that portray them as helpless and
incapacitated \* \* \*.

The "syndrome" label may encourage jurors to receive the defendant as
pathological. Such a perception is at odds with a defense argument that
the woman's actions were actually reasonable in light of the
circumstances. \* \* \*

More recent work has made it clear that BWS is no longer the appropriate
term to describe either the state of our knowledge or the content of
expert testimony. The phrase, "testimony on battering and its effects"
more accurately describes the expert evidence because it focuses on
battered women's experiences, moves their social context to the
foreground, emphasizes the diversity of their range of reactions, and
highlights the utility of expert testimony to explain the psychological
sequelae of living with violence."^2^

3\. *Intimate Partner Violence Statistics*: According to the Family
Safety Center, approximately 92% of all women in California prisons have
been battered or abused in their lifetimes. As many as 90% of women in
jail today for killing men had been battered by those men, and, in 60%
of cases where a woman killed her significant other, the woman claims
that the victim abused her or assaulted her at the time of the crime.
Among victims of abuse, women are 75% of the total, while victims of
self defense were 96% male. Despite the fact that women are commonly
victims of abuse before murdering their significant other, the [average
prison
sentence](https://familysafetycenter.org/battered-women-in-prison/) of
women who kill their male partners is 15 years, whereas the average
sentence for men who kill their female partners is 2-6 years.

     While women are more commonly perceived as the victims of intimate
partner violence, it is important to note that men are not exempt from
experiencing intimate partner violence. The National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence (NCADV) reports that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have
experienced some form of physical violence by an intimate partner. It
goes further to report that [1 in 4 women and 1 in 7
men](https://ncadv.org/statistics) have been victims of severe physical
violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.

4\. *Intimate Partner Violence and the Imminancy Requirement:* Consider
the following observation by Professor Richard Rosen:

"On one level the view of the majority of the North Carolina Supreme
Court is unassailable---the threat of death or great bodily harm was not
imminent when Ms. Norman shot her husband, not, at least, by any
reasonable interpretation of the word imminent. At the time she killed
her husband, Ms. Norman had at least several hours of peace and safety
before her, and even more if she chose to be absent when her husband
awoke. Thus, to the extent the court was simply applying the settled law
\* \* \* its decision was surely correct. The attempt by the dissent to
wrestle the facts of this case into the confines of the imminence
requirement, while understandable and perhaps even laudable, was
unpersuasive. \* \* \*"

[Richard A. Rosen, *On Self-Defense, Imminence, and Women Who Kill Their
Batterers*, 71 N.C. L. Rev. 371, 375--76
(1993).](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ibb2418915a9a11dbbe1cf2d29fe2afe6/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)

     In order to successfully utilize self-defense as a justification,
the necessity element, which states that lethal force against an
aggressor may not be used unless necessary, must be satisifed. Do you
think that the application of *necessity* or *imminency* should bear
more weight when considering abuse as a precedent for a self-defense
claim? Did the *Norman* court err in emphasizing imminence over
necessity?

5\. *Brief History of the use of BWS Testimony in California*: [Rosemary
Dyer](https://www.sinbysilence.com) was sentenced to life without parole
in 1989 for killing her husband. Her conviction rested on two pieces of
evidence: lying in wait and murder for financial gain. The facts of the
case resemble those in Norman, except this case included the additional
fact that Dyer purchased a life insurance policy for her husband several
weeks before she shot him. Her explanation was that he ordered her to
purchase policies for both of them, but that she was denied coverage
because of her long history of health problems, stemming in part from
abuse. Her case, in part, led to the [passage of
legislation](https://www.npr.org/2012/10/05/162169484/jailed-domestic-abuse-victims-get-chance-at-freedom)
known as the [Sin by Silence
Bills](http://legislation.sinbysilence.com).^3^

     Prior to 1996, judges did not allow expert testimony related to
battered woman syndrome as part of the defense. The California Penal
Code stated in relevant part:

"Homicide is ... justifiable when committed by any person in any of the
following cases:

   1. When resisting any attempt to murder any person, or to commit a
felony, or to do some great bodily injury upon any person; or, ...

   3. When committed in the lawful defense of such person, ... when
there is reasonable ground to apprehend a design to commit a felony or
to do some great bodily injury, and imminent danger of such design being
accomplished; but such person, ... must really and in good faith have
endeavored to decline any further struggle before the homicide was
committed; ..."

     After Dyer\'s conviction, [California Evidence Code
1107](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/N6762E200118011D9A4628C0933BA4B78/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)
was passed, which states:

"(a) In a criminal action, expert testimony is admissible by

either the prosecution or the defense regarding intimate partner

battering and its effects, including the nature and effect of

physical, emotional, or mental abuse on the beliefs, perceptions, or

behavior of victims of domestic violence, except when offered against

a criminal defendant to prove the occurrence of the act or acts of

abuse which form the basis of the criminal charge.

 

\(b\) The foundation shall be sufficient for admission of this

expert testimony if the proponent of the evidence establishes its

relevancy and the proper qualifications of the expert witness. Expert

opinion testimony on intimate partner battering and its effects

shall not be considered a new scientific technique whose reliability

is unproven."

 

     While Dyer's case gave rise to legal reform when considering
intimate partner violence cases, it did not retroactively change the
outcome of her case. How might these new statutes and evidentiary rules
have changed the outcome of the *Norman* case? Do you think Dyer's case
would have turned out differently had these statutes been passed prior
to her conviction?

6\. In [*People v.
Humphrey*](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ia57a1903fab411d98ac8f235252e36df/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad74036000001739c04d198a9941aef%3FNav%3DCASE%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIa57a1903fab411d98ac8f235252e36df%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=49ef38ccddce33d3f4f8f9e83533b64a&list=CASE&rank=1&sessionScopeId=889794f66ffa84e4276aaa35909ae8598c73a85185b5be9602c96850d2bd44ce&originationContext=Smart%20Answer&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=%28sc.Search%29)
(1996), the defendant, Evelyn Humphrey, killed Albert Hampton, a man
with whom she had been living. She testified about the abuse he
inflicted on her while they lived together. After her testimony was
corroborated and an expert witness testified that her abuse led to the
defendant suffering from an extreme pattern of battered women's
syndrome, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the evidence
regarding battered women\'s syndrome only in deciding whether the
defendant actually believed it was necessary to kill in self-defense,
and not in deciding whether that belief was reasonable.

     The Supreme Court of California reversed the trial and appellate
court judgements indicating that the trial court erred in its
instruction because "evidence of battered women\'s syndrome is generally
relevant to the reasonableness, as well as the subjective existence, of
a defendant\'s belief in the need to defend, and, to the extent it is
relevant, the jury may consider it in deciding both questions."^4^
Consider the following excerpt from *People v. Humphrey:*

"For killing to be in self-defense, the defendant must actually and
reasonably believe in the need to defend. \*\*\* If the belief
subjectively exists but is objectively unreasonable, there is 'imperfect
self-defense,' i.e., 'the defendant is deemed to have acted without
malice and cannot be convicted of murder,' but can be convicted of
manslaughter. \*\*\* To constitute 'perfect self-defense,' i.e., to
exonerate the person completely, the belief must also be objectively
reasonable.\*\*\* As the Legislature has stated, '\[T\]he circumstances
must be sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable person \....'
\*\*\* Moreover, for either perfect or imperfect self-defense, the fear
must be of imminent harm. 'Fear of future harm-no matter how great the
fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm-will not
suffice. The defendant\'s fear must be of *imminent* danger to life or
great bodily injury.'"^5^

Assume that in the *Norman* case, because the defendant killed the
decedent while he was sleeping, her self defense claim becomes an
imperfect defense. Do you think that because the imminency requirement
was not met, her self defense claim is made in error? Should an
imperfect defense preclude someone from an acquittal in all
circumstances?

7\. Consider three different scenarios:

a\. Taylor is routinely physically and mentally abused by their partner.
After ten years of escalating abuse, Taylor kills their partner by
poisoning his food.

b\. David is routinely physically and emotionally abused by his wife.
Every time he does something innocuous that she perceives to be wrong,
she berates him and threatens him. Sometimes, it escalates to her
hitting him with objects. One day, when David is getting screamed at, he
stabs his wife, killing her.

c\. Allison is routinely physically and emotionally abused by her
husband, Steve. One day, Steve lunges toward her with a meat cleaver.
She has been hit by him before, and in her state of panic, she stabs
Steve, killing him.

     Each of these scenarios is coupled with prior abuse, but have
varying degrees of imminency of danger. If each of these individuals
experience the effects of "battered spouse syndrome," should we treat
the cases differently because the first two defenses could be considered
imperfect, whereas the third defense could be considered perfect? Do you
think this contributes to the preservation of justice?

     Would the outcome of these hypos change under [Model Penal Code §
3.04](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findtype=L&pubNum=1002069&cite=ULPNCOS3.04&transitiontype=Default&contextdata=(sc.Default)&originationcontext=RequestDirector&__lrTS=20200706221058347&firstPage=true&bhcp=1&CobaltRefresh=26570)?

Florida Statute on Justifiable Use of Force

 

CHAPTER 776

JUSTIFIABLE USE OF FORCE

 

776.012 Use or threatened use of force in defense of person.---

(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except
deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person
reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or
herself or another against the other's imminent use of unlawful force. A
person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this
subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening
to use such force.

(2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if
he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such
force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to
himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a
forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in
accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has
the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening
to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in
a place where he or she has a right to be.

 

776.013 Home protection; use or threatened use of deadly force;
presumption of fear of death or great bodily harm.---

(1) A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent
peril of death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another
when using or threatening to use defensive force that is intended or
likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if:

(a) The person against whom the defensive force was used or threatened
was in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, or had
unlawfully and forcibly entered, a dwelling, residence, or occupied
vehicle, or if that person had removed or was attempting to remove
another against that person's will from the dwelling, residence, or
occupied vehicle; and

(b) The person who uses or threatens to use defensive force knew or had
reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and
forcible act was occurring or had occurred.

(2) The presumption set forth in subsection (1) does not apply if:

(a) The person against whom the defensive force is used or threatened
has the right to be in or is a lawful resident of the dwelling,
residence, or vehicle, such as an owner, lessee, or titleholder, and
there is not an injunction for protection from domestic violence or a
written pretrial supervision order of no contact against that person; or

(b) The person or persons sought to be removed is a child or grandchild,
or is otherwise in the lawful custody or under the lawful guardianship
of, the person against whom the defensive force is used or threatened;
or

(c) The person who uses or threatens to use defensive force is engaged
in a criminal activity or is using the dwelling, residence, or occupied
vehicle to further a criminal activity; or

(d) The person against whom the defensive force is used or threatened is
a law enforcement officer, as defined in s. 943.10(14), who enters or
attempts to enter a dwelling, residence, or vehicle in the performance
of his or her official duties and the officer identified himself or
herself in accordance with any applicable law or the person using or
threatening to use force knew or reasonably should have known that the
person entering or attempting to enter was a law enforcement officer.

(3) A person who is attacked in his or her dwelling, residence, or
vehicle has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her
ground and use or threaten to use force, including deadly force, if he
or she uses or threatens to use force in accordance with s. 776.012(1)
or (2) or s. 776.031(1) or (2).

(4) A person who unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter a
person's dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle is presumed to be
doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or
violence.

(5) As used in this section, the term:

(a) "Dwelling" means a building or conveyance of any kind, including any
attached porch, whether the building or conveyance is temporary or
permanent, mobile or immobile, which has a roof over it, including a
tent, and is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night.

(b) "Residence" means a dwelling in which a person resides either
temporarily or permanently or is visiting as an invited guest.

(c) "Vehicle" means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized,
which is designed to transport people or property.

 

776.031 Use or threatened use of force in defense of property.---

(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except
deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person
reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or
terminate the other's trespass on, or other tortious or criminal
interference with, either real property other than a dwelling or
personal property, lawfully in his or her possession or in the
possession of another who is a member of his or her immediate family or
household or of a person whose property he or she has a legal duty to
protect. A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with
this subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or
threatening to use such force.

(2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force
only if he or she reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to
prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person who uses
or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this subsection does
not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground
if the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not
engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a
right to be.

 

776.032 Immunity from criminal prosecution and civil action for
justifiable use or threatened use of force.---

(1) A person who uses or threatens to use force as permitted in s.
776.012, s. 776.013, or s. 776.031 is justified in such conduct and is
immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use or
threatened use of such force by the person, personal representative, or
heirs of the person against whom the force was used or threatened,
unless the person against whom force was used or threatened is a law
enforcement officer, as defined in s. 943.10(14), who was acting in the
performance of his or her official duties and the officer identified
himself or herself in accordance with any applicable law or the person
using or threatening to use force knew or reasonably should have known
that the person was a law enforcement officer. As used in this
subsection, the term "criminal prosecution" includes arresting,
detaining in custody, and charging or prosecuting the defendant.

(2) A law enforcement agency may use standard procedures for
investigating the use or threatened use of force as described in
subsection (1), but the agency may not arrest the person for using or
threatening to use force unless it determines that there is probable
cause that the force that was used or threatened was unlawful.

(3) The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
compensation for loss of income, and all expenses incurred by the
defendant in defense of any civil action brought by a plaintiff if the
court finds that the defendant is immune from prosecution as provided in
subsection (1).

 

776.041 Use or threatened use of force by aggressor.---The justification
described in the preceding sections of this chapter is not available to
a person who:

(1) Is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping after the
commission of, a forcible felony; or

(2) Initially provokes the use or threatened use of force against

likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant; or

(b) In good faith, the person withdraws from physical contact with the

776.05 Law enforcement officers; use of force in making an arrest.---A
law enforcement officer, or any person whom the officer has summoned or

known, or reasonably appears, to be a law enforcement officer.

The Trial of Bernhard Goetz: Goetz\'s Videotaped Confession

 

**The following excerpt from the interview is included in The Trial of
Bernhard Goetz (Aae Films, 1988).**

*On December 31, 1984, after turning himself in to Concord, New
Hampshire police, Bernhard Goetz was subjected to two lengthy
interviews. The first was an audiotaped interviewed with Concord police
detectives and the second was a more contentious two-hour videotaped
interview with three New York City police detectives, Susan Braver,
Michael Clark, and Dan Hattendorf\....This excerpt from what is commonly
called Goetz\'s \"confession,\" reveals Goetz to be\--at least at the
time of the interview\--in a highly disturbed state of mind.*

Braver: Mr. Goetz, I am assistant district attorney, Susan Braver from
the New York county town of Manhattan district attorney's office, this
gentlemen are Mr. Hattendorf of the transit police squad and Detective
Clark of the New York Police Department\...Now, you indicated earlier to
us that you. You indicated earlier to the detective here that you would
to speak with us about this incident.

Goetz: Oh God, when I hear Manhattener's speak, I didn't want to.

Braver: Mr. Goetz, this is all on video tape.

Goetz: Sure, sure.

Braver: Nothing that is said in this room is off the video tape.

Goetz: That's..that's that's....

Braver: For your protection and for ours.

Goetz: That's fine. I don't, I don't want to be rude but I just don't
want to speak to you. I have nothing to say.

Clark: Bernard.

Goetz: You don't understand.

Clark: Bernard

Clark: Could I talk to you?

Goetz: Sure.

Braver: Before they do that\....I want to be sure you understand that
you have all your rights in connection with speaking to us.

Goetz: Okay.

Braver: Okay?

Goetz: Okay.

Braver: If you will let Detective Clark....please let Detective Clark
tell it to you, okay

Clark: Bernard, could I just explain some things to you\....Sit
back..first of all I would like for you to just try and relax a little
bit, okay?\...Sit back...just sit back.

Goetz: Nothing I've got to say is going to make sense.

Goetz: In order for...I know, in order I...I...I... you want this to end
huh?

Clark: I know you want this to be over. I know you came in voluntarily.
This thing must be weighing heavily on your mind.

Goetz: That's not important. That's not important. Get to the point, get
to the point.

Braver: The point...the point. The point is Mr. Goetz right off the bat,
I \'m going to tell you I want to be sure you understand exactly what it
is we're doing here, okay? Now, you have the right to remain silent\--do
you know that?

Goetz: Okay, okay

Braver: Do you understand?

Goetz: I...I... just don't know what to say to you.

Braver: Do you understand that you don't have to talk to us?

Goetz: Yes, okay...My, my\...I .. I don't want to talk to you. I don't
want to talk to you. All right, all right, all right. I can't, I can't
believe I'm saying this, I\... I\... I\... I apologize for it but I\...
I\... I\... just, I just I don't want to talk to you.

Braver: Would you like a cup of coffee or something?

Goetz: No, I'd like to get out of here.

Braver: Are you cold?

Goetz: No, I'm not. I just, I would just like to get out of this room.

Braver: We would like to resolve this.

Goetz: Okay, good you would like to resolve it. I know you would like
to.

Braver: And I know you would.

Goetz: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah isn't that great? I apologize I know, I know
I'm not being civil because for you this is all business that's, that's,
that's what this is for you, all business, you know. I\... I\... I
don't, I don't, I don't, I don't want to be rude to you, I'm, I'm, I'm
sorry, I just, I just, I just, I just you, you, you, say I have the
right to remain silent?

Braver: Yes.

Goetz: That's what I prefer to do, that's, that's what I prefer, I\'m
sorry. I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not hiding behind this thing but,
but, just when I hear I\... I\... I\... I don't know how I can explain
this to you as individuals, but just when I hear people from the
Manhattan business world talk and, and, and their tone of voice,
Manhattan.

Braver: We all live in Manhattan

Goetz: Yes and its, its, its, its, its, it makes, I.., I.., I.., I..,
I.., I can't stand it, just, just, just the sound. It's, it's, it's it's
it's, it's all, you know how, how if, if, if, if, if you, if you want
the information I'm I'm giving you all the information and, and, and if
you want to know something the worst that was said about me is true. For
a period of time I was a cold-blooded murderer. Now, they didn't, I mean
that may not even come to pass but that's what I really really was,
okay. Now, now all those things there I'll, I'll sign it. You have, you
have all the facts and and what you want to do with it but but hearing
people saying all the time what is right and and and what is wrong and
and people don't people they don't even know, they, they, they don't
even know. Is this what they typed? Is this what they typed?

Braver: This is what I was handed here in New Hampshire.

Goetz: Okay, I'll sign it. Sure yeah, this is it. This is, this is it.

Braver: Um...if you want us to take this as your statement I have to
know what it says, it's what you said.

Goetz: What, what, ah, oh, oh, okay, sure, sure, sure, ah that's, ah
that's true. Ah that's true.

Braver: Sir, I'd like you to careful and and and look at it.

Goetz: That's true.

Goetz: What is this \"yah, yah\"? I never said \"yah yah.\" I said yes.
I might of said \"yeah yeah, the train was moving,\" I never said \"yah
yah.\" Yah, yah\....Maybe um..um..well somebody else said\...

Clark: Maybe in New Hampshire a New York \"yeah \"is a New Hampshire
\"yah\"\-- a \"yeah\" in New York is a New Hampshire \"yah.\"

Braver: Are you um, um are you looking at that?

Goetz: Yes, I am.

Braver: You can read that quickly?

Goetz: Well no, I'm not reading every line but these are ah these are
these are all phrases every I.. I.. I.. I just spot things and I ...
this is true, this is true.

Braver: Would it really be a hardship for you to read that every line?

Goetz: If you insist.

Braver: It's important to you.

Goetz: If you insist.

Braver: It's better, you could, um, talk to me or you could read every
line if you say this you talking to me.

Goetz: That's that's that's so important for the technicalities isn't
it?

Braver: No.

Goetz: Oh yes it's\...It's for you\....All of this has be formalities
and and by the rules\...

Braver: No, it's for you.

Goetz: Oh yes, yes, for my protection.

Braver: It's for your protection.

Goetz: Do you know how sick your legal system makes me Miss? Miss, I..
I.. I just don't want to talk to you again. New York city is a system
that knows so much and is so good you decide what you decide what is
right and wrong.

Braver: The people will.

Goetz: Oh you're so competent the people will\...God, the people will
the people will.

Braver: This has to go the grand jury, Mr. Goetz.

Goetz: This has to go to the grand jury. Isn\'t that wonderful? It's
it's a part of your system. It's just great, it's just great. I.. I.. I
tell you the government in the city is\--it's a disgrace and if you
don't now look I may be the biggest piece of bleep in the world and you
can drag me through the dirt, I don't care, but there is a bigger issue
and that is the government of New York city is a disgrace. I've heard
things said about me\--that I am uncivilized, okay or I acted in an
uncivilized way, in the most, if you think this is vicious, if you know
what is in my mind is the most vicious thing that I can think of is that
person who said that, I.. I wish they were sitting there in that seat
instead of me, that would have been beautiful. I mean, I wish I was
never there and they were there\--that would of been great. People talk
about law and order and, you know, and and\... and lawlessness, you talk
you talk about lawlessness. This city doesn't care about lawlessness.
You talk about anarchy that's what there is now. I don't care what you
do to me\--it doesn't matter. You see I'm not hiding anything but but
all this is it's it's like a dam and water is building up behind the dam
and eventually and this is just a crack in the dam or a little hole
that's in the dam and eventually something. What I did down there was,
let's say it's wrong, that doesn't bother me, but what this did is it
showed the system as being a sham. That's why the city so vehemently
attacked the Guardian Angels\--because\...because\...because the sham
showed the city for it is. It showed the legal system for what it is. It
is a sham.

Braver: How does it show the legal system for what it is?

Goetz: Because because people who are violent are just like let back out
on the street again and again and they're charged with nothing. Do you
do you understand that? If, if..if..if\...if\...if a person has to be
reduced to this kind of animal to survive in the city\--I mean if you
take a rat, okay, I was vicious, I don't deny it, if, if, if, if you
take a rat and you corner it and you, ah let's say just one time you
start poking it with red hot needles and the rat, the rat, doesn't know
how to react when do you this okay and you wind up doing it again or you
know perhaps again and if once in awhile the rat turns viciously on you
and becomes a\...a\...a\...a\...a totally vicious killer\--which is
which is really what I was\--then don't don't go passing statements of
morality saying \"ah, well this was not warranted\" or \"this was ah or
you know he should have done this or all he had to do was show the
gun.\" I've been situations where I've shown the gun. What happened here
is I snapped, show them the gun at one point would ah...

Braver: How come you didn't show the gun the other times and this time
you did? Was there anything that that\...

Goetz: You don't, you don't, you\...you\...you weren't there, you
weren't there\--what okay I'm going to give give you an honest answer,
you don't you don't understand. The threat, when I was surrounded at at
that point showing the gun would have been enough but when I saw this
one fellow, when I saw the gleam in his eye and and the smile on his
face and and and they say it's a joke and lot of them say it's a joke...

Clark: Was he the one that ask for the money?

Goetz: What?

Clark: Was he the one that asked for the money?

Goetz: \[Sighing\]..I don't care about the technicality. Asking for the
money is bullshit. The guy\--his his exact words were \"Give me five
dollars\"\--that's bullshit. The robbery had nothing to do it. When I
saw, when I saw his smile and the look in his eye and and you\...you
can't understand this how can people like you be familiar with violence?
If okay\--if\...if you have a skull with a glass globe in the center,
people can come up to that skull and break the teeth and and break the
jaw and whatever right and ah. What the city will do is they will help
you wire up the jaw together and and put the teeth in and and patch up
and and the glass globe inside is is shattered still and on the outside
everything everything is fine so as long as things on the surface are
patched up the city says fine everything is okay and it's not like that.
If\...if\...if the city doesn't change eventually the city is going to
reap it's\...it's\...it's\...it's going to reap the harvest that it
sowed, okay? And and and sign

Braver: Mr. Goetz why these four? Why these four?

Goetz: Oh\...oh\...oh isn't that beautiful? You you ask the question in
in in an intellectual way: \"Why these four?\"

Braver: Why these four?

Goetz: I didn't pick out these four. I never met those guys. I told you
guys in here I\...I never met them.

Braver: But why these four though, I mean...

Goetz: Because, because, because I saw what they were intending to do
with me, Miss. They were intending, they were intending to play with me
like a cat plays with a mouse. Now, you're not familiar with violence ah
\[sighs\]. There, there are so many details. It's all, it's all in here.
There so many things that happen afterwards it would it would take it
would take 10 minutes, 20 minutes to describe I've been through it and
it's so painful to go through it again and again.

Clark: I know but we're just trying to verify that what you did is what
you said you did\....But, but but what about the five shots did that
come out the newspaper? Well which victim did you\...

Goetz: Victim! Victim! You call him the victim?
Okay\...okay\...I\...I\...I accept, I\...I\...I accept. I\...I accept
that, I accept that they are the victims. I'm not going to contest
anything, I'm not going to contest anything.

Clark: Bernard which one was he in the sequence of the shooting?

Goetz: Okay, okay he would have been, he would have been
ah\...ah\...ah\...um\...the\...the\...the\...ah\...the sequence is
um\...um\...um\...not, not a simple sequence\...

Clark: Okay, as best you can just tell me which one would have been
up\...

Goetz: In my mind I what what frightens me is either I missed somebody
once, and that means I shouldn't have been shooting at all. That doesn't
bother me. I, ah\...Let me say I wanted to I told those guys here
already. I wanted to kill those guys. I wanted to maim those guys. I
wanted to make those them suffer in every way I could\--and you can\'t
understand this because it's a realm of reality that you're not familiar
with. If I had more bullets I would have shot them all again and again.
My problem was I ran out of bullets. Do I have to go this route? Do do
do you want to hear it one more time?

Braver: What?

Goetz:The whole story?

Braver: We'd love to this way we could satisfy\...

Goetz: Okay, I just want to give a little background about me and
violence.

Braver: Sure.

Goetz: Okay, start with I'm\...I'm no nice guy you're going to be able
to drag me through the dirt, I don't care about that. I've got plenty of
faults,\...Several years ago I got, ah, I got jumped about 2:30 on Canal
Street\--2:30 in the afternoon during the week. I was jumped by three
guys, now. They deliberately went after my knee and they got it. Like,
ah, like I got kicked in the knee and then, and then, and what hurts you
is that they didn't have weapons and people you don't have to maimed
with a weapon what what really, what really, hurts you is is the
sidewalk. They tried to push me through a plate glass door and I'm in
good physical shape\--I\... I can do, you know, push-ups standing on my
hands. I pushed as hard as I could and when I hit that door I still hit
that door so hard, that door with my hands, I still hit that door so
hard\--the glass. the glass hard\--the glass didn't break, thank God,
you know because that that that would have been it, but the, but the,
handle\--yeah, yeah, yeah, the handle\--it it hit my chest and and
afterwards now I\...I\...I was a wreck. I was hyper in\...in\...in
hyperactivity for about four days after that. I went up to Connecticut
to work and everything and four days later I check into a emergency room
and my chest was messed up. It took about six months to heal and I had a
bad knee\--a permanent bad knee from that. Since then, since then, prior
to this incident I was, I was, attacked, I was attacked. The next day I
was carrying I was carrying a gun. Now this particular incident I\...I
was in the middle of a project. I got disgusted with it. I was working
on a piece of equipment. I said well I better take a break. I\...I went
downtown. I got on the train. When,when, the first, the fellow, one of
the fellows who was lying down there were four fellows in there. He lied
down, and he and he was lying down and, ah, he looked at me and said,
"How are you doing?"

Clark: What were you feeling when he said how were you doing? What were
you thinking then? What was your impression of how are you doing? What,
what were you feeling?

Goetz: These were just kids kidding around.

Clark: Okay\....

Goetz: That's\...that's\...that's\...that's all. It could have just been
kids kidding around but but it's just a possible warning, just a
possible warning. It\...it is wasn't even a possible warning, it was a
prime but then two of them stood up\--okay\--and they walked over to my
left, okay. Now there were two of them to my right and and and two on my
left. Now, I\...I\...I knew at that point I would have to pull the gun.
I'm, going say this. At that time I was going to pull the gun. But I
wasn't going to kill them. And that's what I wound\--what I wound up
trying to do, but I had no intention of killing them at that time.

Clark: Well, what was your intention?

Goetz: Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. What my intention was at
that time was just to follow the situation as closely as I could. The
one on my left, he asked me, he didn't ask me\...What he according to
the papers he asked me, "Give me five dollars"\--and he said it with a
smile and his eyes were bright. I knew I had to pull the gun, but it was
the look. And now you cannot understand this. It was, it was, it was,
his eyes were shiney. He had a smile on his face. I saw the smile on his
face and and and the shine, the shine is his eyes, that he was enjoying
this. I knew what they were going to do. Do you understand? Okay, do you
understand now? At that point, now. For combat you have to be cold
blooded and I was. And it was at that point I decided to kill them after
all, murder them all, do anything.

Braver: What did you think they were going to do?

Goetz: Laughing...How can you ask a question like that? What what what
they were going to do is they were going to they were going to have fun
with me with me, Miss.

Brabver: What do you mean by that?

Goetz: What do you mean?

Braver: What is your interpretation of that? I can't get inside your
head.

Goetz: Beat the shit out of you. What they were going to do was is is
enjoy me for awhile. They were going to beat the fucking shit out of me,
okay.

Clark: Did you feel trapped?

Goetz: Did I feel? What do you think? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I felt
free, I felt free. You know I was enjoying Fun City.

Clark: I see what you were felt at the time.

Goetz: I was just whistling Dixie, okay? I was in fear. And that's good,
because that helps that helps you think. That helps you think. But when
I saw his eyes, up to that point my state of mind changed and you go
through a different state of mind where reality totally totally changes.
So I had my pattern of flight laid out. It was obvious and what you do
is is is you don't think. You just, you don't think, just act. Speed is
everything, speed is everything. You just think of speed and the count.
You don't need verification. When he said, "Give me five dollars," I
pulled out the piece I just started firing. Now its\...its\...its on
point to look at what your firing at. You just target images in your
mind. You aim for the center of the mass, you keep moving. All you have
to do is be ah\...ah faster than they are. Now, perhaps they're, you
don't know what is happening on your right hand side, but it doesn't
matter. You do what you have do as quickly as possible. You don't think.
You live you live for the fraction of the moment to the
fraction\...fraction of the moment. The ah\...the ah\...the ah\...the
the you just react, you just react, you forget everything that happened
the instant before and you site. You don't understand: I'm explaining
what happened. You site, listen, listen, listen, listen you site your
target. That was number one, I got rid of number one. Got number two.

Got rid of number two. They say I shot him in the back. That doesn't
even matter. I wasn't even aiming for the back. You aim for the center.
One of the fellows looked like he was trying\...I\...I\...I\...I don't
know. I don't know if he was facing from the front or the back,
whatever. But it seemed as if he was trying to get through the steel
wall of the subway car. But he couldn't. I let him have it and I let of
the other guys have it. The one who that was pretending he wasn't with
them, and I ran up to the first two to check them. Who were on the
ground. The first two that I had shot and they were taken care of. It
was all very cold-blooded, Miss. And this is going to offend everyone.
And I went back to the other two to check on them. I wanted to know if I
had missed and I, but I\...I\...I\...I went to them a second time and I
looked at him and\--he can't verify this because he was probably out of
it by then, if I shot him or not, I don't know\--and I said, "You seem
to be doing all right, here's another."

People are looking for a hero or they are looking for a villain. And
neither is...neither is nothing is the truth. What you have
here\...here\...what you have here is nothing more...What you have here
is nothing more than a vicious rat. That's all it is is. It's not Clint
Eastwood. It's not...its not taking the law in your own hands. You can
label that. It's not being judge, judge, jury and executioner.

Clark: Bernard, can we get back...

Goetz: What this is\--what this is, what this is\--listen, I\'m going to
tell you what this is, and you won\'t understand. This is\--this is,
this is\--survival instinct, okay? And\...and\...and you can condemn it
all you want. I\...I\...I\...I\...I\...I\...just don\'t care
anymore\....

Necessity and Duress

 

Excuses, unlike justifications, do not assert that an action was morally
right: instead, they deem an action to have been wrong, but less
blameworthy under the circumstances. Every category of excuse, however,
raises problems. In the case of duress, the question becomes what level
of duress is necessary to excuse a crime, and what crimes can it excuse?
As you will see, there is both a traditional duress doctrine and a
reformed doctrine promoted by the Model Penal Code. Consider the
differences between duress (an excuse) and necessity (a justification).
What is the distinction between them, and why does blameworthiness
attach to one but not the other?

OPINION

MATTHEWS, Justice.

Shortly after midnight on May 22, 1976, Dale Nelson drove his four-wheel
drive truck onto a side road off the Steese Highway near mile 68. His
truck became bogged down in a marshy area about 250 feet off the
highway. Nelson testified that he was afraid the truck might tip over in
the soft ground. He and his two companions, Lynnette Stinson and Carl
Thompson, spent an hour unsuccessfully trying to free the vehicle. At
about 1:00, Nelson began walking with Stinson down the highway. An
acquaintance drove by and offered to help, but was unable to render much
assistance. He then drove Nelson and Stinson to a Highway Department
Yard where heavy equipment was parked. The yard was marked with
"no-trespassing" signs. After waiting several hours for someone to come
by, they decided to take a dump truck and use it to pull out Nelson's
vehicle. The dump truck also became stuck.

At approximately 10:00 that morning a man identified only as "Curly"
appeared. His vehicle was also stuck further down the highway. Curly
offered to assist Nelson. They returned to the heavy equipment yard and
took a front-end loader, which they used to free the dump truck. They
then used the dump truck to free Curly's car. The dump truck was
returned to the equipment yard, but when Nelson attempted to use the
front-end loader to free his own truck the front-end loader also became
bogged down.

Frustrated and tired after twelve hours of attempting to free his
vehicle, Nelson and his companions quit and went to sleep. Two of them
slept in a tent. One of them went to sleep in the truck. They were
awakened by a Highway Department employee, who placed them under
citizen's arrest.

Considerable damage was done to both the front-end loader and the dump
truck as a result of Nelson's attempt to free his truck.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X744285f9d0b3c3a9b0e2ab230aa54ed20fad596) Ultimately, the truck
was pulled from the mud three days later. Nelson was convicted in
district court of reckless destruction of personal property in violation
of AS 11.20.515(b)[^168] and joyriding in violation of AS
28.35.010.[^169] This conviction was affirmed on appeal to the superior
court.

The sole question presented is whether the jury was properly instructed
on the defense of necessity. Nelson requested an instruction which read:

> You are instructed that the defendant is allowed to use a motor
> vehicle of another person without permission if the use is for an
> emergency in the case of immediate and dire need.
>
> You are further instructed that once the defendant has raised the
> issue of emergency or necessity, the state must prove the lack of
> emergency or necessity beyond a reasonable doubt.

Over Nelson's objection, the court gave an instruction on the necessity
defense which read as follows:

> You are instructed that it is a defense to a crime such as joyriding
> or taking someone else's motor vehicle without his permission that the
> person acted out of necessity in a case of immediate and dire need.
> However, such a defense exists only when natural forces create a
> situation wherein it becomes necessary for a person to violate the law
> in order to avoid a greater evil to himself or his property. The harm'
> which is to be avoided must be the greater harm and it must be
> immediate and dire. Where a reasonable alternative other than
> violating the law is available in order to avoid the harm the defense
> of necessity is not applicable.[^170]

Nelson argues that the jury instruction was erroneous because it allowed
the jury to apply what he calls an "objective, after-the-fact" test of
need and emergency, rather than a "subjective, reasonable man" test. By
this we assume Nelson means that he was entitled to have explained to
the jury that they must view the question of necessity from the
standpoint of a reasonable person knowing all that the defendant did at
the time he acted.

We affirm the conviction. We note at the outset that the instruction
proposed by Nelson is similarly lacking of any explicit language
allowing the jury to find necessity if there was a reasonable belief
that an emergency existed as opposed to an actual emergency. Thus even
if Nelson's proposed instruction had been given verbatim the alleged
error would not have been corrected. Beyond this, however, we find any
error in the instruction given to have been harmless.

The defense of necessity may be raised if the defendant's actions,
although violative of the law, were necessary to prevent an even greater
harm from occurring.

> The rationale of the necessity defense is not that a person, when
> faced with the pressure of circumstances of nature, lacks the mental\'
> element which the crime in question requires. Rather, it is this
> reason of public policy: the law ought to promote the achievement of
> higher values at the expense of lesser values, and sometimes the
> greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal
> language of the criminal law.

W. LaFave & A. Scott, *Criminal Law* § 50 at 382 (1972).

Commentators generally agree that there are three essential elements to
the defense: 1) the act charged must have been done to prevent a
significant evil; 2) there must have been no adequate alternative; 3)
the harm caused must not have been disproportionate to the harm avoided.
Arnolds & Garland, *The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The Right
to Choose the Lesser Evil,* 65 J. of Crim.L.P. & C.S. 289, 292 (1974);
*See* W. LaFave & A. Scott, *supra* § 50 at 385-88.

The instruction given adequately describes these requirements for the
jury. Nelson argues that he was entitled to wording which would
explicitly allow the jury to find a necessity defense if a reasonable
person at the time of acting would have believed that the necessary
elements were present. Nelson is correct in stating that the necessity
defense is available if a person acted in the reasonable belief that an
emergency existed and there were no alternatives available even if that
belief was mistaken.[^171] Moreover, the person's actions should be
weighed against the harm reasonably foreseeable at the time, rather than
the harm that actually occurs.

Assuming that the instruction given was not worded adequately to convey
these concepts to the jury, we would find the error harmless, for Nelson
failed to make out a case for the necessity defense. The "emergency"
situation claimed by Nelson to justify his appropriation of the
construction equipment was the alleged danger that his truck, stuck in
the mud, might tip over, perhaps damaging the truck top. However by the
time Nelson decided to use the equipment the truck had already been
stuck for several hours. The dire nature of the emergency may be judged
by the fact that some twelve hours later, having unsuccessfully
attempted to remove the vehicle from the mud, one of Nelson's companions
fell asleep in the truck, which had still not tipped over.

Nor can it be said that Nelson had no lawful alternatives in his
situation. The record shows that during the time Nelson was trying to
free the vehicle people stopped on several different occasions and
offered their services in the form of physical assistance; rides, or
offers to telephone state troopers or a tow truck.

Finally, it cannot be said that the harm sought to be avoided in this
case --- potential damage to Nelson's truck --- was greater than the
harm caused by Nelson's illegal, actions. Even disregarding the actual
damage to the equipment caused by Nelson's use, the seriousness of the
offenses committed by Nelson were disproportionate to the situation he
faced. The legislature has made this clear by making reckless
destruction of personal property a crime punishable by imprisonment for
up to one year and a \$5,000 fine,[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe65cfe11453de891d6275ae57dbdbb4055e6354)and joyriding punishable
by imprisonment for up to one year and a \$1,000 fine.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xf89038e9492377fe159d9fe7e43375558c11442)The equipment taken by
Nelson was marked with no trespassing signs. Nelson's fears about damage
to his truck roof were no justification for his appropriation of
sophisticated and expensive equipment.

AFFIRMED.

I. INTRODUCTION

In August 2006 Jennifer Greenwood fled from her home in North Pole in
the middle of the night, believing that she was about to be attacked by
her former boyfriend and that he was planning to burn down his parents\'
nearby home. After screaming for help and calling 911, Greenwood got
into her van and drove away. Greenwood drove less than a mile to her
ex-boyfriend\'s parents\' home and honked to try to wake them. She then
drove a few blocks to the nearest well-lighted area along the highway,
where she stopped to wait for the troopers who were responding to her
911 call, flagging them down when they arrived.

Greenwood had been drinking, and she was arrested and charged with
felony driving under the influence. After hearing evidence and testimony
about these incidents, the trial court denied Greenwood a jury
instruction on the necessity defense, concluding that Greenwood was
justified only in driving as far as her ex-boyfriend\'s parents\' home.
A jury convicted Greenwood, and the court of appeals affirmed, reasoning
that Greenwood had presented no evidence that the danger continued after
she reached the parents\' home and that she had the alternative of
remaining in her van with the doors locked. Because we conclude that
Greenwood presented some evidence of each of the elements of the
necessity defense, we reverse and remand for a new trial with a
necessity instruction.

II FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS

On August 10, 2006, Jennifer Greenwood was home alone in her camper in
North Pole waiting for Jay Way to arrive. Greenwood wanted to speak with
Way, whom she had dated that summer, about her missing puppy that she
suspected he may have taken. Because Greenwood\'s camper did not have
electricity, she started a bonfire outside and lit some candles both
inside and outside of the camper. As it grew late, Greenwood assumed
that Way was not coming, and she let the fire burn down and began
preparing for bed.

But Way did arrive on his four wheeler, and he and Greenwood had a
couple of glasses of wine. Greenwood testified that when she brought up
the subject of the missing puppy, Way seemed \"kind of \[\] mad,\" which
made her feel vulnerable and afraid. Greenwood testified that she had
been told that Way had been physically abusive with his previous
girlfriend and had drug problems, and she decided that the best way to
avoid conflict in the situation would be to agree to have sex with Way.

Afterwards, Greenwood went outside to check on the fire. While she was
outside, she overheard Way \"mumbling\" inside the camper about how he
was going to burn down both Greenwood\'s camper and his parents\' home
and how he would not go back to jail because \"there won\'t be any
witnesses.\" Greenwood then observed Way flinging the lit candles around
her camper, so she began screaming for her neighbors to help her or call
911. When no one came to her aid, Greenwood ran into the woods barefoot
with her other dog. She testified that she could hear Way thrashing
around and throwing things, presumably in his search for her.

Greenwood\'s dog got away from her, ran towards Way, and began to bark.
Way picked up a two-by-four board and swung it at the dog. While Way was
distracted, Greenwood sneaked into the camper to grab her purse
containing her cell phone and quietly headed back into the woods.
Greenwood called her dog back to her and dialed 911 to request help.
After she explained that Way was trying to burn down her house, the
dispatch operator wanted her to stay on the line, but the dog got away
again and started barking at Way, so Greenwood hung up. Way then hit
Greenwood\'s dog with the two-by-four and began \"to ride all around\"
on his four wheeler.

At that point, Greenwood ran to her van with her dog. She testified that
she felt that she needed to get out of the situation and to drive to
Way\'s parents\' house to warn them of the danger because she did not
have their telephone number. Greenwood decided to drive on the back road
to reach Way\'s parents\' house, less than a mile away, in order to
avoid the fast traffic on the main road and to avoid crossing paths with
Way. When Greenwood arrived at Way\'s parents\' home, she saw that all
of the lights were off, so she slowed down and honked her horn to try to
rouse them. She did not stop because she was afraid of running into Way,
who lived with his parents, and because there were no lights on at the
house. Greenwood then drove a \"couple of blocks\" to the nearest
well-lighted spot on the main road, Holmes Road. She parked to wait for
the troopers who would be responding to her 911 call, and when she saw
them, she flagged them down by honking her horn and opening her door.

When the troopers arrived sometime after 2:00 a.m., they found Greenwood
distraught and crying on the side of the road. While interacting with
Greenwood, the troopers smelled alcohol and observed that she was
exhibiting signs of intoxication. Greenwood submitted to a portable
breath test and was arrested for driving under the influence. A
Datamaster test later showed Greenwood\'s blood aleohol concentration to
be 0.184 percent.

Greenwood was charged with felony driving under the influence in
violation of AS 28.35.030(n) on August 16, 2006. The case was assigned
to Superior Court Judge Randy M. Olsen for trial. Before trial began,
the State moved for a protective order that would prevent Greenwood from
raising the affirmative defense of necessity. The trial court did not
rule on this matter immediately, but instead elected to hear the
evidence before making a decision. After the State presented its case,
Greenwood made an offer of proof to the court on what her expected
evidence of the defense would be. The court allowed her to present this
evidence despite the State\'s argument that Greenwood had reasonable
alternatives available to her.

After hearing Greenwood\'s testimony, the superior court stated that
Greenwood had \"at least created a jury question\" as to whether or not
Greenwood had an adequate alternative method of warning Way\'s parents
of the evil she was seeking to prevent. The trial court ruled as a
matter of law, however, that upon Greenwood\'s arrival at Way\'s
parents\' house, the necessity ended: \"\[Ojnce she got to the parents\'
house, she would have accomplished everything that she wanted to
accomplish. It would\'ve been warning the parents. It would\'ve been
finding a safe haven. It was a house that she knew. At that point, she
was not justified in driving further.\" The court explained that \"if
there\'s a continuing offense, like drunk driving, the illegal conduct
must be stopped as soon as the necessity ends,\" and it refused to
instruct the jury on the necessity defense.

Greenwood immediately moved for reconsideration and a mistrial, arguing
that \"it would be extremely prejudicial\" for her testimony to be
stricken. The trial court denied both of the motions but did not strike
Greenwood\'s testimony. Greenwood was convicted and sentenced to 24
months in prison with 20 months suspended.

Greenwood appealed her conviction to the court of appeals, arguing that
she was entitled to a necessity instruction under the
circumstances.[^172] The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\'s
ruling, reasoning that Greenwood\'s failure to remain at Way\'s
parents\' house because she did not wish to encounter Way undermined her
argument that it was necessary for her to drive to their house to warn
them of Way\'s intentions, making an encounter with Way \"seemingly \...
inevitable.\" [^173] The court of appeals further pointed out that
Greenwood did not offer any evidence that Way ever arrived at his
parents\' house or that \"she would have been in danger had she simply
stayed in her car, with the doors locked, and continued honking her horn
until she roused Way\'s parents.\" [^174]

Chief Judge Coats dissented from the memorandum - opinion, -
maintaining - that Greenwood had \"presented \'some evidence\' to
justify her decision to drive to the main road to contact the state
troopers\" because her testimony demonstrated that she was concerned
about an encounter with Way and that she wanted to ensure that the
troopers were able to find both her and the Way residence.[^175] In the
dissent\'s view, \"a jury could reasonably find that Greenwood\'s
decision to avoid a confrontation with Way was justifiable.\" [^176]
Moreover, the dissent noted that Greenwood had \"asserted the basis for
her defense before she was arrested.\"

We granted Greenwood\'s petition for hearing on the question of whether
she was entitled to a necessity instruction at trial.

III\. STANDARD OF REVIEW

\"A defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the necessity defense
if \[she\] presents \'some evidence\' in support of that defense.\" We
review whether a defendant has presented some evidence of a proposed
defense de novo after considering the entire record [^177] and viewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant.[^178]

IV\. DISCUSSION

\"The common law defense of necessity is available to criminal
defendants in Alaska except where preempted or excluded by the
legislature.\"[^179] To receive the benefit of a necessity defense, the
defendant must show the existence of three essential elements: \"10
\[the act charged must have been done to prevent a significant evil; 2)
there must have been no adequate alternative; 3) the harm caused must
not have been disproportionate to the harm avoided.\" When the defendant
is accused of a continuing offense, such as drunk driving, she \"must
also show some evidence that \[\]4) she stopped violating the law as
soon as the necessity ended.\" In order to receive the benefit of this
defense, the accused must have \"reasonably believed at the time of
acting that the first, second, and \... fourth elements were present.\"
The defendant\'s value judgment concerning the third element, whether
the \"reasonably foreseeable harm resulting from the violation would be
less than the harm resulting from compliance with the law,\" is
evaluated objectively using the facts as the defendant reasonably
perceived them.[^180]

If a defendant presents \"some evidence\" of each of these elements, the
defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the necessity
defense.[^181] \"\'Some evidence\' is evidence that, viewed in the light
most favorable to the defendant, would allow a reasonable juror to find
in the defendant\'s favor on each element of the defense.\" The \"some
evidence\" burden is not a heavy one-as long as the defendant produces
some evidence to support each element of the defense, \"any weakness or
implausibility in that evidence is irrelevant\" [^182] and \"a matter
for the jury, not for the court.\"[^183] As the court of appeals noted,
\"a strong argument can be made that a trial judge should err on the
side of giving instructions\" on a proposed defense in order to prevent
the jury from considering \"its own understanding of what \[the
proposed\] defense is in the absence of an instruction from the
court.\"[^184]

Greenwood argues that she presented some evidence of each element of the
necessity defense and that she was therefore entitled to a jury
instruction. The State counters that Greenwood failed to present
evidence \"from which a juror could conclude that her stated belief in
the need to continue driving after reaching the Way home was
reasonable.\" We consider de novo whether Greenwood has presented some
evidence of each of the elements of the necessity defense.\"[^185]

A. Greenwood Presented Some Evidence That She Drove Under The Influence
To Prevent A Significant Evil.

Both the trial court and the court of appeals accepted Greenwood\'s
contention that she needed to drive away from her camper on the night in
question to prevent a significant evil.[^186] But both courts seemed to
define the significant evil to be prevented narrowly: \"impending
arson\" perpetrated against Way\'s parents.[^187] Greenwood argues a
broader theory of the threat she was seeking to avoid, that \"she was
terrified for her safety and the safety of Way\'s parents.\"

Greenwood testified that she overheard Way say that he was planning on
burning down his parents\' home and would leave no witnesses and that
she saw him take aggressive actions, such as throwing lit candles inside
her camper and hitting her dog with a board. This testimony provides
some evidence that Greenwood was seeking to prevent several evils:
physical harm to herself, harm to Way\'s parents, and arson to her home
and Way\'s parents\' home. These harms are significant and consistent
with the requirement that \"the harm sought to be avoided by a defendant
raising the necessity defense must have emanated either from a natural
cause or from illegal human acts.\"[^188]

As Chief Judge Coats pointed out in his dissent, \"\[ulnlike most cases
where defendants claim, after the fact, that their violation of the law
was justified by necessity, Greenwood asserted the basis for her defense
before she was arrested.\" Greenwood\'s fear apparently motivated her to
call the police and then flag them down, despite the fact that it was
obvious that she had broken the law by drinking and driving. This
persuades us that she reasonably believed that her conduct was necessary
at the time of acting. We conclude that Greenwood presented some
evidence of the first element, that there were several significant harms
that her actions were calculated to avoid.

B. Greenwood Presented Some Evidence That There Were No Adequate
Alternatives And That The Necessity Continued Until She Stopped Driving.

We next consider whether Greenwood presented some evidence of both the
second element-that there were no adequate alternatives to the unlawful
action-and the fourth element-that the legal violation stopped as soon
as the necessity ended. There is some inherent factual overlap between
the second element and the fourth element because an alternative that
becomes available at a given point during a continuing violation can
serve to end the necessity. Because we look to the reasonableness of
Greenwood\'s beliefs at the time she acted in evaluating whether she has
presented some evidence of both the second and fourth elements, we will
consider these elements together.\"[^189]

The trial court agreed with Greenwood that she provided some evidence of
a necessity that required her to drive away from her camper and to
Way\'s parents\' house, and the court of appeals did not disturb this
ruling.[^190] The court of appeals explained, \"Greenwood presented no
evidence to suggest that it was reasonable for her to believe (1) that
this danger remained an immediate one \[upon arriving at Way\'s
parents\' house\] and (2) that she needed to continue driving to avert
it.\" [^191] The majority opinion reasoned that Greenwood\'s failure to
stop at the Way residence because she did not want to encounter Way
undercut her justification for driving there in the first place-warning
Way\'s parents of his imminent arrival and intentions.[^192]

The court of appeals also pointed to a potential alternative:

> In addition, Greenwood offered no evidence that she would have been in
> danger had she simply stayed in her car, with the doors locked, and
> continued honking her horn until she roused Way\'s parents. Greenwood
> may have subjectively believed that it would not be safe for her to
> follow this course of action-but \... a defendant\'s subjective
> beliefs are not sufficient, standing alone, to establish this prong of
> the necessity defense.\[[^193]\]

As previously stated, in deciding whether a defendant has produced some
evidence that no adequate alternative existed and that the violation of
the law ceased once the necessity ended, courts consider the
defendant\'s reasonable beliefs at the time, even if those beliefs are
mistaken, rather than objectively weighing all potential
alternatives.[^194] The implausibility of a defendant\'s story, or any
weakness in the evidence supporting that story, is not a relevant
consideration.[^195] This standard is applied to both aspects of the
second element-whether the defendant believed that alternatives existed
and whether the defendant believed those alternatives were adequate-as
well as to the fourth element. In applying the \"some evidence\" test in
the related self-defense context, Alaska case law has emphasized that,

> because reasonableness is a factual question closely allied with
> considerations involving the credibility of witnesses and the weight
> to be given to their testimony, trial courts must avoid basing

It was therefore error for the court of appeals to conclude that
Greenwood\'s subjective beliefs were not sufficient to satisfy the
\"some evidence\" test for the second and fourth elements of the
necessity defense.

This is not to say, however, that a court must always hold that the
\"some evidence\" test has been met when a defendant asserts that her
belief at the time was that there were no adequate alternatives.
Instead, as the court of appeals explained in Seibold v. State, courts
may refuse to instruct the jury on the necessity defense when the
defendant had \"clear legal alternatives to violating the law.\"[^197]
When a defendant testifies to her beliefs at the time of acting, the
question for the judge is whether a \"clear legal alternative\" existed
such that the defendant is unable as a matter of law to meet her burden
of presenting some evidence that she reasonably believed that there were
no adequate alternatives to her unlawful action.

Both this court and the court of appeals have upheld rulings where the
existence of clear legal alternatives prevented a defendant from
receiving a jury instruction on the necessity defense. For example, in
Nelson v. State we held that the defendant, who had unlawfully used two
Highway Department vehicles to free his truck that was stuck in a marshy
area, had failed to make out the case for the necessity defense because
several people had stopped and offered to help him, thus providing
lawful alternatives. Similarly, in Cleveland v. Municipality of
Anchorage we held that the defense of necessity was not available to
defendants charged with trespassing at an abortion clinic in order to
prevent abortions for several reasons, including that the defendants
could have engaged in non-criminal forms of protest. The court of
appeals likewise affirmed the trial court\'s refusal to instruct the
jury on the necessity defense in Schnabel v. State when the defendant
failed to pursue the judicial and administrative remedies available to
resolve his claimed necessity. Finally, in Gerlach v. State the court of
appeals concluded that a non-custodial mother who hid her daughter out
of state for a year was not entitled to a necessity instruction based on
her claim that the father was abusive because adequate remedies were
available at law.

We next turn to the question whether Greenwood fulfilled the requirement
of some evidence for the second and fourth elements. The \"some
evidence\" test does not require

> that the defendant testify or even offer direct evidence in his own
> behalf. Some evidence establishing a dispute as to a factual issue may
> arise from weakness in the prosecution\'s evidence or from impeachment
> of its witness. Similarly, circumstantial evidence presented as part
> of the state\'s case-in-chief may give rise to some evidence of a
> disputed fact.\[\]

In this case, we consider whether Greenwood provided some evidence that
she reasonably believed at the time of driving that she had no adequate
alternatives and that the necessity continued until she stopped her
vehicle. These questions must be evaluated in light of our previous
conclusion that the harms Greenwood was seeking to prevent included the
threat to her own safety.

Our decision in McGee v. State provides guidance on when a court should
conclude that a defendant has provided some evidence of a subjective
belief that there were no adequate alternatives available. In McGeq, the
defendant presented evidence that his mother\'s boyfriend threatened
that he would run over the defendant, McGee. McGee maintained that he
feared that the boyfriend would make good on this threat because of an
earlier physical altercation, so McGee claimed to have smashed the
windows of the boyfriend\'s pickup truck to make sure that the boyfriend
could not see him to run him over. We held that, although there were
likely many other available options, McGee\'s testimony raised a
question of fact concerning whether he reasonably failed to recognize
those other options because of his agitated mental state. Consistent
with McGee, we also consider that the threat to Greenwood\'s safety was
fresh and imminent, and we take into account the emotions that a person
in her position could have experienced.

Greenwood\'s evidence, including her testimony that she first screamed
for help and called 911 before deciding to drive away to escape a
dangerous situation, demonstrates that she exhausted the most obvious of
her alternatives before deciding to take the ile-gal action. She also
offered testimony that she was unwilling to stop at the Way residence
and risk a confrontation with her attacker because Way was on a four
wheeler and she was unsure of his whereabouts when she approached the
Way residence in her van. As Greenwood argued, she had reason to suspect
that Way \"was likely to return\" to his parents\' house because \"Way
also live\[d\] at that house.\" Greenwood\'s other actions, such as
stopping of her own accord in a well-lighted area, where she waited for
police until she flagged them down, are consistent with her
understanding of the necessity-her need to escape from Way and to warn
his parents of the potential harm by waking them.

The court of appeals concluded that Greenwood failed to present some
evidence of the fourth element because Greenwood did not offer any
evidence that it would have been dangerous for her to sit in her locked
van outside of Way\'s parents\' house while honk ing to wake the
parents. We disagree. To meet the \"some evidence\" test for the fourth
element, Greenwood is not required to present evidence that every
possible alternative was unavailable to her; instead she need only
provide some evidence that she reasonably believed that the necessity
continued until the point that she stopped violating the law, even if
that belief was mistaken. Furthermore, even if she was required to
present evidence that she reasonably believed that this alternative was
not available to her and that she believed the necessity continued
because she could not stop and wait, Greenwood\'s testimony that Way had
access to a two-by-four that he had previously employed as a weapon
against her dog provided a foundation for a reasonable belief that she
was not safe waiting in a dark car, even with the doors locked.

We therefore conclude that Greenwood\'s testimony constituted some
evidence sufficient to enable a reasonable juror to decide that
Greenwood reasonably believed that she had no adequate alternatives to
breaking the law by driving under the influence-even if that belief was
mistaken-and that she stopped driving onee she believed the necessity
had ended.

C. Greenwood Presented Some Evidence That The Reasonably Foreseeable
Harm Resulting From Her Unlawful Action Would Be Less Than The Harm
Resulting From Her Compliance With The Law.

The third element of proportionality requires that \"\[aln objective
determination \... be made as to whether the defendant\'s value judgment
was correct, given the facts as \[she\] reasonably perceived them.\" As
discussed previously, the trial court and the court of appeals assumed
that the only harm that Greenwood was seeking to avoid was \"possible
arson or a threat of arson,\" but we have concluded that the potential
harm to Greenwood herself must also be considered. The harm that
Greenwood identifies, including risk to her personal safety because of
Way\'s threats and physical aggression, are significant. Further, her
testimony about the rumors that she had heard about Way\'s drug use and
violent history are relevant because the \"third element requires an
objective comparison of the relative seriousness of the harms caused and
avoided when viewed in light of the facts perceived by the defendant.\"

Our analysis and balancing process must also account for the serious
risk that drunk driving poses to the public, particularly because we
consider the harm reasonably foreseeable from a defendant\'s actions,
not the harm that actually occurred. Greenwood had already exhausted
available options such as screaming for help and calling the police, and
she testified that she took concrete steps to mitigate the risk of
driving under the influence by driving on a back road and reaching
speeds of only 35 miles per hour. Although driving any distance under
the influence poses a significant risk, Greenwood testified that she
continued driving only \"a couple of blocks\" after reaching Way\'s
parents\' home until she reached a well-lighted home on the route that
she assumed that the troopers would take in responding to her 911 call-a
total drive of less than one mile from beginning to end.

Considering that the trial court and the court of appeals agreed that
Greenwood was justified in driving the distance between her camper and
the Way residence, the question presented is whether Greenwood\'s
decision to continue driving those last few blocks was disproportionate
to the harm she was seeking to prevent-potential physical harm to
herself resulting from an altercation with Way. As Chief Judge Coats
pointed out in his dissent, \"\[plolice agencies often warn the public
to seek police help rather than to directly intervene in potentially
dangerous situations.\" The rationale behind the necessity defense is
one of public policy: \"the law ought to promote the achievement of
higher values at the expense of lesser values, and sometimes the greater
good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language
of the criminal law.\"

Because the threshold for the \"some evidence\" test only requires
\"more than a scintilla\" of evidence with any doubt resolved in
Greenwood\'s favor, we conclude that Greenwood has offered some evidence
of the third element. Viewing the totality of the situation from
Greenwood\'s perspective and considering her testimony regarding her
emotional distress, we cannot conclude that there was not some evidence
presented that the serious risk that she posed by driving under the
influence was disproportionate to the serious physical injury,
significant property damage, and other harms she reasonably feared at
the time.

v\. CONCLUSION

Because we conclude that Greenwood has met the \"some evidence\" test
with respect to all four elements required for an instruction on the
necessity defense, we REVERSE her conviction and REMAND for a new trial
at which an instruction on Greenwood\'s necessity defense be given.

BOOCHEVER, Circuit Judge:

Gregory Schoon, Raymond Kennon, Jr., and Patricia Manning appeal their
convictions for obstructing activities of the Internal Revenue Service
Office in Tucson, Arizona, and failing to comply with an order of a
federal police officer. Both charges stem from their activities in
protest of United States involvement in El Salvador. They claim the
district court improperly denied them a necessity defense. Because we
hold the necessity defense inapplicable in cases like this, we affirm.

I.

On December 4, 1989, thirty people, including appellants, gained
admittance to the IRS office in Tucson, where they chanted "keep
America's tax dollars out of El Salvador," splashed simulated blood on
the counters, walls, and carpeting, and generally obstructed the
office's operation. After a federal police officer ordered the group, on
several occasions, to disperse or face arrest, appellants were arrested.

At a bench trial, appellants proffered testimony about conditions in El
Salvador as the motivation for their conduct. They attempted to assert a
necessity defense, essentially contending that their acts in protest of
American involvement in El Salvador were necessary to avoid further
bloodshed in that country. While finding appellants motivated solely by
humanitarian concerns, the court nonetheless precluded the defense as a
matter of law, relying on Ninth Circuit precedent. The sole issue on
appeal is the propriety, of the court's exclusion of a necessity defense
as a matter of law.

II\.

A district court may preclude a necessity defense where "the evidence,
as described in the defendant's offer of proof, is insufficient as a
matter of law to support the proffered defense." *United States v.
Dorrell,* 758 F.2d 427, 430 (9th Cir.1985). To invoke the necessity
defense, therefore, the defendants colorably must have shown that: (1)
they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2)
they acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) they reasonably anticipated a
direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be
averted; and (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law.
*United States v. Aguilar,* 883 F.2d 662, 693 (9th Cir.1989), *cert.
denied,* --- U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 751, 112 L.Ed.2d 771 (1991). **\[ ...
\]**

The district court denied the necessity defense on the grounds that (1)
the requisite immediacy was lacking; (2) the actions taken would not
abate the evil; and (3) other legal alternatives existed. Because the
threshold test for admissibility of a necessity defense is a conjunctive
one, a court may preclude invocation of the defense if "proof is
deficient with regard to any of the four elements." *Id.* at 693.

While we could affirm substantially on those grounds relied upon by the
district court, \>Jwe-find a deeper, systemic reason for the complete
absence of federal case law recognizing a necessity defense in an
indirect civil disobedience case. As used in this opinion, "civil
disobedience" is the wilful violation of a law, undertaken for the
purpose of social or political protest. *Cf. Webster's Third New
International Dictionary* 413 (unabridged, 1976) ("refusal to obey the
demands or commands of the government" to force government concessions).
Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law or interfering with
a government policy that is not, itself, the object of protest. Direct
civil disobedience, on the other hand, involves protesting the existence
of a law by breaking that law or by preventing the execution of that law
in a specific instance in which a particularized harm would otherwise
follow. *See* Note, *Applying the Necessity Defense to Civil
Disobedience Cases,* 64 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 79, 79-80 & n. 5 (1989). This case
involves indirect civil disobedience because these protestors were not
challenging the laws under which they were charged. In contrast, the
civil rights lunch counter sit-ins, for example, constituted direct
civil disobedience because the protestors were challenging the rule that
prevented them from sitting at lunch counters. Similarly, if a city
council passed an ordinance requiring immediate infusion of a suspected
carcinogen into the drinking water, physically blocking the delivery of
the substance would constitute direct civil disobedience: protestors
would be preventing the execution of a law in a specific instance in
which a particularized harm --- contamination of the water supply ---
would otherwise follow.

**\[ ... \]**Today, we conclude, for the reasons stated below, that the
necessity defense is inapplicable to cases involving indirect civil
disobedience.

III\.

Necessity is, essentially, a utilitarian defense. *See* Note, *The State
Made Me Do It: The Applicability of the Necessity Defense to Civil
Disobedience,* 39 Stan.L.Rev. 1173, 1174 (1987). It therefore justifies
criminal acts taken to avert a greater harm, maximizing social welfare
by allowing a crime to be committed where the social benefits of the
crime outweigh the social costs of failing to commit the crime. *See,
e.g., Dorrell,* 758 F.2d at 432 (recognizing that "the policy underlying
the necessity defense is the promotion of greater values at the expense
of lesser values") (citation omitted). Pursuant to the defense,
prisoners could escape a burning prison, *see, e.g., Baender v.
Barnett,* 255 U.S. 224, 226, 41 S.Ct. 271, 272, 65 L.Ed. 597 (1921); a
person lost in the woods could steal food from a cabin to survive, *see*
Posner, *An Economic Theory of the Criminal Law,* 85 Colum.L.Rev. 1193,
1205 (1985); an embargo could be violated because adverse weather
conditions necessitated sale of the cargo at a foreign port, *see The
William Gray,* 29 F.Cas. 1300, 1302 (C.C.D.N.Y. 1810); a crew could
mutiny where their ship was thought to be unseaworthy, *see United
States v. Ashton,* 24 F.Cas. 873, 874 (C.C.D.Mass. 1834); and property
could be destroyed to prevent the spread of fire, *see, e.g., Surocco v.
Geary,* 3 Cal. 69, 74 (1853).

What all the traditional necessity cases have in common is that the
commission of the "crime" averted the occurrence of an even greater
"harm." In some sense, the necessity defense allows us to act as
individual legislatures, amending a particular criminal provision or
crafting a one-time exception to it, subject to court review, when a
real legislature would formally do the same under those circumstances.
For example, by allowing prisoners who escape a burning jail to claim
the justification of necessity, we assume the lawmaker, confronting this
problem, would have allowed for an exception to the law proscribing
prison escapes.

Because the necessity doctrine is utilitarian, however, strict
requirements contain its exercise so as to prevent nonbeneficial
criminal conduct. For example, " '\[i\]f the criminal act cannot abate
the threatened harm, society receives no benefit from the criminal
conduct.' " *Applying the Necessity Defense,* 64 N.Y.U.L.Rev. at 102
(quoting *United States v. Gant,* 691 F.2d 1159, 1164 (5th Cir.1982)).
Similarly, to forgive a crime taken to avert a lesser harm would fail to
maximize social utility. The cost of the crime would outweigh the harm
averted by its commission. Likewise, criminal acts cannot be condoned to
thwart threats, yet to be imminent, or those for which there are legal
alternatives to abate the harm.

Analysis of three of the necessity defense's four elements leads us to
the conclusion that necessity can never be proved in a case of indirect
civil disobedience. We do not rely upon the imminent harm prong of the
defense because we believe there can be indirect civil disobedience
cases in which the protested harm is imminent.

A.

7\. *Balance of Harms*

*It is* axiomatic that, if the thing to be averted is not a harm at all,
the balance of harms necessarily would disfavor any criminal action.
Indirect civil disobedience seeks first and foremost to bring about the
repeal of a law or a change of governmental policy, attempting to
mobilize public opinion through typically symbolic action. These
protestors violate a law, not because it is unconstitutional or
otherwise improper, but because doing so calls public attention to their
objectives. Thus, the most immediate "harm" this form of protest targets
is the *existence* of the law or policy. However, the mere existence of
a constitutional law or governmental policy cannot constitute a legally
cognizable harm. *See* Comment, *Political Protest and the Illinois
Defense of Necessity,* 54 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1070, 1083 (1987) ("In a society
based on democratic decision making, this is how values are ranked --- a
protester cannot simply assert that her view of what is best should
trump the decision of the majority of elected representatives."); *cf.
Dorrell,* 758 F.2d at 432 ("\[T\]he law should \[not\] excuse criminal
activity intended to express the protestor's disagreement with positions
reached by the lawmaking branches of the government.").

There may be, of course, general harms that result from the targeted law
or policy. Such generalized "harm," however, is too insubstantial an
injury to be legally cognizable. We have in the past rejected the use of
the necessity defense in indirect civil disobedience cases as a " 'back
door' attempt to attack government programs in a manner foreclosed by
\[federal\] standing requirement\^\]." *United States v. Lowe,* 654 F.2d
562, 566-67 (9th Cir. 1981) (citing *Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee
to Stop the War,* 418 U.S. 208, 220-21, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 2931-32, 41
L.Ed.2d 706 (1974) (standing to attack governmental conduct requires
direct, concrete injury; abstract injury insufficient)); *see United
States v. May,* 622 F.2d 1000, 1009 (9th Cir.) (same), *cert. denied,*
449 U.S. 984, 101 S.Ct. 402, 66 L.Ed.2d 247 (1980). The law could not
function were people allowed to rely on their *subjective* beliefs and
value judgments in determining which harms justified the taking of
criminal action. *See United States v. Moylan,* 417 F.2d 1002, 1008-09
(4th Cir.1969) ("\[E\]xercise of a moral judgment based upon individual
standards does not carry with it legal justification or immunity from
punishment for breach of the law\.... Toleration of such conduct would
\[be\] inevitably anarchic."), *cert, denied,* 397 U.S. 910, 90 S.Ct.
908, 25 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970).

The protest in this case was in the form of indirect civil disobedience,
aimed at reversal of the government's El Salvador policy. That policy
does not violate the Constitution, and appellants have never suggested
as much. There is no evidence that the procedure by which the policy was
adopted was in any way improper; nor is there any evidence that
appellants were prevented systematically from participating in the
democratic processes through which the policy was chosen. *See United
States v. Carotene Products Co.,* 304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n. 4, 58 S.Ct.
778, 783-84 n. 4, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938) (implicitly reserving special
solicitude for discrete and insular minorities). The most immediate harm
the appellants sought to avert was the existence of the government's El
Salvador policy, which is not in itself a legally cognizable harm.
Moreover, any harms resulting from the operation of this policy are
insufficiently concrete to be legally cognizable as harms for purposes
of the necessity defense.

Thus, as a matter of law, the mere existence of a policy or law validly
enacted by Congress cannot constitute a cognizable harm. If there is no
cognizable harm to prevent, the harm resulting from criminal action
taken for the purpose of securing the repeal of the law or policy
necessarily outweighs any benefit of the action.

*2. Causal Relationship Between Criminal Conduct and Harm to be Averted*

This inquiry requires a court to judge the likelihood that an alleged
harm will be abated by the taking of illegal action. In the sense that
the likelihood of abatement is required in the traditional necessity
cases, there will never be such likelihood in cases of indirect
political protest. In the traditional cases, a prisoner flees a burning
cell and averts death, or someone demolishes a home to create a
firebreak and prevents the conflagration of an entire community. The
nexus between the act undertaken and the result sought is a close one.
Ordinarily it is the volitional illegal act alone which, once taken,
abates the evil.

In political necessity cases involving indirect civil disobedience
against congressional acts, however, the act alone is unlikely to abate
the evil precisely because the action is indirect. Here, the IRS
obstruction, or the refusal to comply with a federal officer's order,
are unlikely to abate the killings in El Salvador, or immediately change
Congress's policy; instead, it takes another *volitional* actor not
controlled by the protestor to take a further step; Congress must change
its mind.

*3. Legal Alternatives*

A final reason the necessity defense does not apply to these indirect
civil disobedience cases is that legal alternatives will never be deemed
exhausted when the harm can be mitigated by congressional action. As
noted above, the harm indirect civil disobedience aims to prevent is the
continued existence of a law or policy. Because congressional action can
*always* mitigate this "harm," lawful political activity to spur such
action will always be a legal alternative. On the other hand, we cannot
say that this legal alternative will always exist in cases of direct
civil disobedience, where protestors act to avert a concrete harm
flowing from the operation of the targeted law or policy.

Thé necessity defense requires the absence of any legal alternative to
the contemplated illegal conduct which could reasonably be expected to
abate an imminent evil. *See United States v. Bailey,* 444 U.S. 394,
410, 100 S.Ct. 624, 635, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (alternative exists if
there is "a chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to
avoid the threatened harm") (quoting W. LaFave & A. Scott, *Handbook on
Criminal Law* 379 (1972)). A prisoner fleeing a burning jail, for
example, would not be asked to wait in his cell because someone might
conceivably save him; such a legal alternative is ill-suited to avoiding
death in a fire. In other words, the law implies a reasonableness
requirement in judging whether legal alternatives exist.

Where the targeted harm is the existence of a law or policy, our
precedents counsel that this reasonableness requirement is met simply by
the possibility of congressional action. For example, in *Dorrell,* an
indirect civil disobedience case involving a trespass on Vandenburg Air
Force Base to protest the MX missile program, we rejected Dorrell's
claims that legal alternatives, like lobbying Congress, were unavailable
because they were futile. Dorrell, we said, "differed\] little from many
whose passionate beliefs are rejected by the will of the majority
legitimately expressed." 758 F.2d at 432. We assumed there that the
"possibility" that Congress will change its mind is sufficient in the
context of the democratic process to make lawful political action a
reasonable alternative to indirect civil disobedience. Without expressly
saying so, *Dorrell* decided that petitioning Congress to change a
policy is *always* a legal alternative in such cases, regardless of the
likelihood of the plea's success. Thus, indirect civil disobedience can
never meet the necessity defense requirement that there be a lack of
legal alternatives.

B.

As have courts before us, we could assume, as a threshold matter, that
the necessity defense is conceivably available in these cases, but find
the elements never satisfied. Such a decision, however, does not come
without significant costs. First, the failure of the federal courts to
hold explicitly that the necessity defense is unavailable in these cases
results in district courts expending unnecessary time and energy trying
to square defendants' claims with the strict requirements of the
doctrine. Second, such an inquiry oftentimes requires the courts to
tread into areas constitutionally committed to other branches of
government. For example, in *May,* which involved trespass on a naval
base to protest American nuclear weapons policy, we noted that, "\[t\]o
consider defendants' argument \[that trespassing was justified by the
nefariousness of the Trident missile\] would put us in the position of
usurping the functions that the Constitution has given to the Congress
and to the President." *May,* 622 F.2d at 1009; *cf. Schlesinger v.
Reservists Committee to Stop the War,* 418 U.S. 208, 222, 94 S.Ct. 2925,
2933, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974) (to grant standing to protestors would both
risk distortion of "the role of the Judiciary in its relationship to the
Executive and the Legislature and open the Judiciary to an arguable
charge of providing 'government by injunction' "). Third, holding out
the possibility of the defense's applicability sets a trap for the
unwary civil disobedient, rather than permitting the individual to
undertake a more realistic cost-benefit analysis before deciding whether
to break the law in political protest. Fourth, assuming the
applicability of the defense in this context may risk its distortion in
traditional cases. Finally, some commentators have suggested that the
courts have sabotaged the usually low threshold for getting a defense
theory before the jury as a means of keeping the necessity defense from
the jury. *See, e.g., Applying the Necessity Defense,* 64 N.Y.U.L.Rev.
at 85-89; *The State Made Me Do It,* 39 Stan L.Rev. at 1178-79.

The real problem here is that litigants are trying to distort to their
purposes an age-old common law doctrine meant for a very different set
of circumstances. What these cases are really about is gaining notoriety
for a cause --- the defense allows protestors to get their political
grievances discussed in a courtroom. *The State Made Me Do It,* 39
Stan.L.Rev. at 1176. It is precisely this political motive that has left
some courts, like the district court in this case, uneasy. *See* March
23, 1990 Order of District Court at 4-5 ("Neither a small nonpolicy
making service office of the IRS nor this Courtroom is the proper venue
for deciding political questions."); *May,* 622 F.2d at 1009. Because
these attempts to invoke the necessity defense "force the courts to
choose among causes they should make legitimate by extending the defense
of necessity," *Dorrell,* 758 F.2d at 432, and because the criminal
acts, themselves, do not maximize social good, they should be subject to
a *per se* rule of exclusion.

Thus, we see the failure of any federal court to recognize a defense of
necessity in a case like ours not as coincidental, but rather as the
natural consequence of the historic limitation of the doctrine. Indirect
protests of congressional policies can never meet all the requirements
of the necessity doctrine. Therefore, we hold that the necessity defense
is not available in such cases.

CONCLUSION

Because the necessity defense was not intended as justification for
illegal acts taken in indirect political protest, we affirm the district
court's refusal to admit evidence of necessity.

AFFIRMED.

FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge,

concurring:

I agree with much of what the majority says regarding the application of
the necessity defense to this type of case.

I do not mean to be captious in questioning whether the necessity
defense is grounded on pure utilitarianism,[^198] but fundamentally, I
am not so sure that this defense of justification should be grounded on
utilitarian theory alone rather than on a concept of what is right and
proper conduct under the circumstances. *See, e.g.,* G. Fletcher,
Rethinking Criminal Law, 759-875 (1978). *Cf,* J. Thomson, Rights,
Restitution and Risk, 78-116 (1986) (some reflections on the trolley
problem). At any rate this doubt would not prevent me from joining in
the majority's opinion.

I do, however, feel that the law of this circuit constrains me from
saying that the necessity defense is not available in these kinds of
cases. That law is canvassed in the majority's opinion and need not be
restated by me. Of course, the majority is exactly right about the
outcome of this case. It is also probably right about the outcome of all
other cases of this type in the future. Those who would think to use
this defense should first think deeply about what the majority has
written.

Therefore, I concur in the result.

Before FERGUSON and BOOCHEVER, Circuit Judges, and COYLE, District
Judge[**\[ ... \]**](#Xb07727ea9f971137de149d0ca2939a069cd0478)

BOOCHEVER, Circuit Judge.

This case presents an appeal from a conviction for unlawful possession
with intent to distribute a narcotic controlled substance in violation
of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (1976). At trial, the defendant attempted to
offer evidence of duress and necessity defenses. The district court
excluded this evidence on the ground that it was insufficient to support
the defenses. We reverse because there was sufficient evidence of duress
to present a triable issue of fact.

I. FACTS

The defendant-appellant, Juan Manuel Contento-Pachon, is a native of
Bogota, Colombia and was employed there as a taxicab driver. He asserts
that one of his passengers, Jorge, offered him a job as the driver of a
privately-owned car. Contento-Pachon expressed an interest in the job
and agreed to meet Jorge and the owner of the car the next day.

Instead of a driving job, Jorge proposed that Contento-Pachon swallow
cocaine-filled balloons and transport them to the United States.
Contento-Pachon agreed to consider the proposition. He was told not to
mention the proposition to anyone, otherwise he would "get into serious
trouble." Contento-Pachon testified that he did not contact the police
because he believes that the Bogota police are corrupt and that they are
paid off by drug traffickers.

Approximately one week later, Contento-Pachon told Jorge that he would
not carry the cocaine. In response, Jorge mentioned facts about
Contento-Pachon's personal life, including private details which
Contento-Pachon had never mentioned to Jorge. Jorge told Contento-Pachon
that his failure to cooperate would result in the death of his wife and
three year-old child.

The following day the pair met again. Contento-Pachon's life and the
lives of his family were again threatened. At this point,
Contento-Pachon agreed to take the cocaine into the United States.

The pair met two more times. At the last meeting, Contento-Pachon
swallowed 129 balloons of cocaine. He was informed that he would be
watched at all times during the trip, and that if he failed to follow
Jorge's instruction he and his family would be killed.

After leaving Bogota, Contento-Pachon's plane landed in Panama.
Contento-Pachon asserts that he did not notify the authorities there
because he felt that the Panamanian police were as corrupt as those in
Bogota. Also, he felt that any such action on his part would place his
family in jeopardy-

When he arrived at the customs inspection point in Los Angeles,
Contento-Pachon consented to have his stomach x-rayed. The x-rays
revealed a foreign substance which was later determined to be cocaine.

At Contento-Pachon's trial, the government moved to exclude the defenses
of duress and necessity. The motion was granted. We reverse.

A. DURESS

There are three elements of the duress defense: (1) an immediate threat
of death or serious bodily injury, (2) a well-grounded fear that the
threat will be carried out, and (3) no reasonable opportunity to escape
the threatened harm. *United States v. Shapiro,* 669 F.2d 593, 596 (9th
Cir.1982). Sometimes a fourth element is required: the defendant must
submit to proper authorities after attaining a position of safety.
*United States v. Peltier,* 693 F.2d 96 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).

Factfinding is usually a function of the jury, and the trial court
rarely rules on a defense as a matter of law. *See Sandstrom v.
Montana,* 442 U.S. 510, 523, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2459, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979).
If the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support a duress
defense, however, the trial court should exclude that evidence. *United
States v. Glaeser,* 550 F.2d 483, 487 (9th Cir.1977).

The trial court found Contento-Pachon's offer of proof insufficient to
support a duress defense because he failed to offer proof of two
elements: immediacy and inescapability.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xe44535ad1fce83aa3d85de1c223dd3cfd6e1c96)We examine the elements
of duress.

*Immediacy:* The element of immediacy requires that there be some
evidence that the threat of injury was present, immediate, or impending.
"\[A\] veiled threat of future unspecified harm" will not satisfy this
requirement.**\[ ... \]** The district court found that the initial
threats were not immediate because "they were conditioned on defendant's
failure to cooperate in the future and did not place defendant and his
family in immediate danger."

Evidence presented on this issue indicated that the defendant was
dealing with a man who was deeply involved in the exportation of illegal
substances. Large sums of money were at stake and, consequently,
Contento-Pachon had reason to believe that Jorge would carry out his
threats. Jorge had gone to the trouble to discover that Contento-Pachon
was married, that he had a child, the names of his wife and child, and
the. location of his residence. These were not vague threats of possible
future harm. According to the defendant, if he had refused to cooperate,
the consequences would have been immediate and harsh.

Contento-Pachon contends that he was being watched by one of Jorge's
accomplices at all times during the airplane trip. As a consequence, the
force of the threats continued to restrain him. Contento-Pachon's
contention that he was operating under the threat of immediate harm was
supported by sufficient evidence to present a triable issue of fact.

*Escapability:* The defendant must show that he had no reasonable
opportunity to escape. *See United States v. Gordon,* 526 F.2d 406, 407
(9th Cir.1975). The district court found that because Contento-Pachon
was not physically restrained prior to the time he swallowed the
balloons, he could have sought help from the police or fled.
Contento-Pachon explained that he did not report the threats because he
feared that the police were corrupt. The trier of fact should decide
whether one in Contento-Pachon's position might believe that some of the
Bogota police were paid informants for drug traffickers and that
reporting the matter to the police did not represent a reasonable
opportunity of escape.

If he chose not to go to the police, Contento-Pachon's alternative was
to flee. We reiterate that the opportunity to escape must be reasonable.
To flee, Contento-Pachon, along with his wife and three year-old child,
would have been forced to pack his possessions, leave his job, and
travel to a place beyond the reaches of the drug traffickers. A juror
might find that this was not a reasonable avenue of escape. Thus,
Contento-Pachon presented a triable issue on the element of
escapability.

*Surrender to Authorities:* As noted above, the duress defense is
composed of at least three elements. The government argues that the
defense also requires that a defendant offer evidence that he intended
to turn himself in to the authorities upon reaching a position of
safety. Although it has not been expressly limited, this fourth element
seems to be required only in prison escape cases. **\[ ... \]** Under
other circumstances, the defense has been defined to include only three
elements. **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

In cases not involving escape from prison there seems little difference
between the third basic requirement thát there be no reasonable
opportunity to escape the threatened harm and the obligation to turn
oneself in to authorities on reaching a point of safety. Once a
defendant has reached a position where he can safely turn himself in to
the authorities he will likewise have a reasonable opportunity to escape
the threatened harm.

That is true in this case. Contento-Pachon claims that he was being
watched at all times. According to him, at the first opportunity to
cooperate with authorities without alerting the observer, he consented
to the x-ray. We hold that a defendant who has acted under a
well-grounded fear of immediate harm with no opportunity to escape may
assert the duress defense, if there is a triable issue of fact whether
he took the opportunity to escape the threatened harm by submitting to
authorities at the first reasonable opportunity.

B. NECESSITY

The defense of necessity is available when a person is faced with a
choice of two evils and must then decide whether to commit a crime or an
alternative act that constitutes a greater evil. **\[ ...
\]**Contento-Pachon has attempted to justify his violation of 21 U.S.C.
§ 841(a)(1) by showing that the alternative, the death of his family,
was a greater evil.

Traditionally, in order for the necessity defense to apply, the coercion
must have had its source in the physical forces of nature. The duress
defense was applicable when the defendant's acts were coerced by a human
force. W. LaFave & A. Scott, *Handbook on Criminal Law* § 50 at 383
(1972). This distinction served to separate the two similar defenses.
But modern courts have tended to blur the distinction between duress and
necessity.

It has been suggested that, "the major difference between duress and
necessity is that the former negates the existence of the requisite mens
rea for the crime in question, whereas under the latter theory there is
no actus reus." *United States v. Micklus,* 581 F.2d 612, 615 (7th
Cir.1978). The theory of necessity is that the defendant's free will was
properly exercised to achieve the greater good and not that his free
will was overcome by an outside force as with duress.

The defense of necessity is usually invoked when the defendant acted in
the interest of the general welfare. For example, defendants have
asserted the defense as a justification for (1) bringing laetrile into
the United States for the treatment of cancer patients, *Richardson,*
588 F.2d at 1239; (2) unlawfully entering a naval base to protest the
Trident missile system, *United States v. May,* 622 F.2d 1000, 1008-09
(9th Cir.), *cert. denied,* 449 U.S. 984, 101 S.Ct. 402, 66 L.Ed.2d 247
(1980); (3) burning Selective Service System records to protest United
States military action, *United States v. Simpson,* 460 F.2d 515, 517
(9th Cir.1972).

Contento-Pachon's acts were allegedly coerced by human, not physical
forces. In addition, he did not act to promote the general welfare.
Therefore, the necessity defense was not available to him.
Contento-Pachon mischaracterized evidence of duress as evidence of
necessity. The district court correctly disallowed his use of the
necessity defense.

II\. CONCLUSION

Contento-Pachon presented credible evidence that he acted under an
immediate and well-grounded threat of serious bodily injury, with no
opportunity to escape. Because the trier of fact should have been
allowed to consider the credibility of the proffered evidence,[^199] we
reverse. The district court correctly excluded Contento-Pachon's
necessity defense.

Opinion

CHIN, J.

Over two centuries ago, William Blackstone, the great commentator on the
common law, said that duress is no excuse for killing an innocent
person: "And, therefore, though a man be violently assaulted, and hath
no other possible means of escaping death, but by killing an innocent
person, this fear and force shall not acquit him of murder; for he ought
rather to die himself than escape by the murder of an innocent." (2
Jones's Blackstone (1916) p. 2197.)

We granted review to decide whether these words apply in California. We
conclude that, as in Blackstone's England, so today in California: fear
for one's own life does not justify killing an innocent person. Duress
is not a defense to murder. We also conclude that duress cannot reduce
murder to manslaughter. Although one may debate whether a killing under
duress should be manslaughter rather than murder, if a new form of
manslaughter is to be created, the Legislature, not this court, should
do it.

I. The Facts and Procedural History

Defendant was charged with kidnapping and murdering Margaret Armstrong
in a camp area near Eureka called the South Jetty. Defendant and others
apparently suspected the victim of molesting two girls who resided in
the camp. Ron Kiem, the father of one of the girls, pleaded guilty to
Armstrong's second degree murder and testified at defendant's trial.

The prosecution evidence showed that a group of people, including
defendant and Kiem, confronted Armstrong at the camp. Members of the
group dragged Armstrong to a nearby field, beat her, put duct tape over
her mouth, tied her naked to a bush, and abandoned her. Later, defendant
and Kiem, in Kiem's car, saw Armstrong going naked down the street away
from the jetty. The two grabbed Armstrong, forced her into the car, and
drove away. They then put Armstrong into a sleeping bag, wrapped the bag
with duct tape, and placed her, screaming, into the trunk of Kiem's car.

Witnesses testified that defendant picked up a large rock, brought it to
the trunk, and handed it to Kiem. Kiem appeared to hit Armstrong with
the rock, silencing her. Kiem testified that defendant said Armstrong
had to die. After they put her into the trunk, defendant dropped a small
boulder onto her head. Eaem also said that defendant picked up the rock
again, handed it to Kiem, and told him to drop it on Armstrong or
something would happen to his family. Kiem dropped the rock but believed
it missed Armstrong. Kiem and defendant later commented to others that
Armstrong was dead.

The evidence indicated that defendant and Kiem disposed of Armstrong's
body by rolling it down a ravine. One witness testified that Kiem stated
he had stepped on her neck until it crunched to ensure she was dead
before putting her in the ravine. The body was never found.

Defendant testified on his own behalf. He said he had tried to convince
Kiem to take Armstrong to the hospital after she had been beaten. When
he and Kiem saw her going down the road beaten and naked, Kiem grabbed
her and put her in the backseat of the car. Back at camp, Kiem put
Armstrong in the sleeping bag and bound it with duct tape. At Kiem's
instruction, defendant opened the trunk and Kiem put Armstrong inside.
Kiem told defendant to retrieve a certain rock the size of a cantaloupe.
Defendant said, "Man, you are out of your mind for something like that."
Kiem responded, "Give me the rock or I'll beat the shit out of you."
Defendant gave him the rock because Kiem was bigger than he and he was
"not in shape" to fight. When asked what he thought Kiem would have done
if he had said no, defendant replied: "Punch me out, break my back,
break my neck. Who knows." Kiem hit Armstrong over the head with the
rock two or three times. Kiem's wife was standing there yelling, "Kill
the bitch."

Defendant testified that later they left in Kiem's car. They pulled over
and Kiem opened the trunk. Armstrong was still moaning and moving
around. Defendant tried to convince Kiern to take her to a hospital, but
Kiem refused. Defendant got back into the car. A few minutes later, Kiem
closed the trunk, got in the car, and said, "She's dead now. I stomped
on her neck and broke it."

A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder and kidnapping. Based
primarily on his testimony that Kiem threatened to "beat the shit out
of' him, defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in
refusing to instruct the jury on duress as a defense to the murder
charge. The Court of Appeal concluded that duress is not a defense to
first degree murder and affirmed the judgment. We granted defendant's
petition for review to decide to what extent, if any, duress is a
defense to a homicide-related crime, and, if it is a defense, whether
the trial court prejudicially erred in refusing a duress instruction.

II\. Discussion

A. *Whether Duress Is a Defense to Murder*

At common law, the general rule was, and still is today, what Blackstone
stated: duress is no defense to killing an innocent person.[^200]
"Stemming from antiquity, the nearly 'unbroken tradition' of
Anglo-American common law is that duress never excuses murder, that the
person threatened with his own demise 'ought rather to die himself, than
escape by the murder of an innocent.' " (Dressler, *Exegesis of the Law
of Duress: Justifying the Excuse and Searching for Its Proper Limits*
(1989) 62 So.Cal. L.Rev. 1331, 1370, fns. omitted; see also *id.* at p.
1343 & fn. 83, and cases cited.)[^201]

The basic rationale behind allowing the defense of duress for other
crimes "is that, for reasons of social policy, it is better that the
defendant, faced with a choice of evils, choose to do the lesser evil
(violate the criminal law) in order to avoid the greater evil threatened
by the other person." (LaFave, Criminal Law, *supra,* § 5.3, p. 467.)
This rationale, however, "is strained when a defendant is confronted
with taking the life of an innocent third person in the face of a threat
on his own life. . . . When the defendant commits murder under duress,
the resulting harm---i.e. the death of an innocent person---is at least
as great as the threatened harm---i.e. the death of the defendant."
*(U.S. v. LaFleur, supra,* 971 F.2d at p. 205.) We might add that, when
confronted with an apparent kill-an-innocent-person-or-be-killed
situation, a person can always choose to resist. As a practical matter,
death will rarely, if ever, inevitably result from a choice not to kill.
The law should require people to choose to resist rather than kill an
innocent person.

A state may, of course, modify the common law rule by statute. The Model
Penal Code, for example, does not exclude murder from the duress
defense. (See LaFave, Criminal Law, *supra,* § 5.3(b), p. 469, fn. 13.)
Defendant contends the California Legislature modified the rule in the
19th century and made duress a defense to some murders.

Since its adoption in 1872, Penal Code section 26[^202] has provided:
"All persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to
the following classes: \[\*¡\[\] . . . \[f\] . . . Persons (unless the
crime be punishable with death) who committed the act or made the
omission charged under threats of menaces sufficient to show that they
had reasonable cause to and did believe their lives would be endangered
if they refused." Defendant contends the reference to a "crime . . .
punishable with death" means that the crimes to which duress is not a
defense include only those forms of murder that are punishable with
death, and that these forms change with changes in death penalty law. In
1872, when the current Penal Code was adopted, all first degree murder
was punishable with death. *(People v. Green* (1956) 47 Cal.2d 209, 218
\[302 P.2d 307\].) Today only first degree murder with special
circumstances is so punishable. (§§ 190, subd. (a), 190.2, subd. (a).)
Accordingly, defendant contends that today, duress is a defense to all
murder except first degree murder with special circumstances. In effect,
he argues that a killing under duress is either first degree murder with
special circumstances or no crime at all. Because the prosecution did
not allege special circumstances in this case, he continues, duress
provides a full defense.

The sparse relevant California case law is inconclusive. In *People* v.
*Martin* (1910) 13 Cal.App. 96, 102 \[108 P. 1034\], the court noted
that "\[i\]t has ever been the rule that necessity is no excuse for
killing an innocent person." It cited but did not construe section 26
and ultimately found duress was not available under the facts because
the person was not in immediate danger. *(People v. Martin, supra,* at
pp. 102-103.) In both *People* v. *Son* (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 224,
232-233 \[93 Cal.Rptr.2d 871\], and *People v. Petro* (1936) 13
Cal.App.2d 245, 247-248 \[56 P.2d 984\], the court cited section 26 and
stated that duress was not available as a defense, but in each case the
defendant had been convicted of a form of murder then punishable with
death. In *People* v. *Moran* (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 398 \[114 Cal.Rptr.
413\], the court stated in dicta, without analysis, that our decision in
*People v. Anderson* (1972) 6 Cal.3d 628 \[100 Cal.Rptr. 152, 493 P.2d
880\], which had declared unconstitutional the death penalty law then in
effect, "rendered meaningless the exception pertaining to capital crimes
of Penal Code section 26," and therefore "the defense of compulsion was
available to defendant at the time of trial." *(People* v. *Moran,
supra,* at p. 417; see also *Tapia* v. *Roe* (9th Cir. 1999) 189 F.3d
1052, 1057 \[dicta stating, without analysis, that under California law,
"duress can excuse crimes, including murder without special
circumstances"\].) Citing section 26, Witkin states, "The defense of
coercion is generally held unavailable where the crime is homicide;
i.e., the threat even of death to oneself does not excuse the killing of
another innocent person." (1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed.
2000) Defenses, § 54, p. 390.)

In this case, the Court of Appeal concluded that, because all first
degree murders were punishable with death in 1872, when section 26 was
enacted, duress is not a defense to any first degree murder. In effect,
the court concluded that section 26's exception for a "crime . . .
punishable with death" includes any crime punishable with death as of
1872 unaffected by later changes in death penalty law. As we explain, we
agree, except that the Court of Appeal did not go back far enough in
time. The exception for a crime punishable with death refers to a crime
punishable with death as of *1850,* not 1872. Section 26 derives from
section 10 of the original 1850 Act Concerning Crimes and Punishments,
which similarly excepted a crime "punishable with death" from the duress
defense.[^203] Section 5, enacted as part of the original Penal Code in
1872 and unchanged since, provides: "The provisions of this Code, so far
as they are substantially the same as existing statutes, must be
construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments." As
relevant, section 26 was merely a continuation of the then existing 1850
statute. For this reason, we must "begin \... by inquiring into the
intent of the Legislature in 1850 . . . ." *(Keeler v. Superior Court*
(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 625 \[87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d
420\] \[applying § 5 to § 187\].)

In 1850, all murder was punishable with death. (Stats. 1850, ch. 99, §
21, p. 231.) Not until 1856 was murder divided into degrees, with death
the punishment for first degree but not second degree murder. (Stats.
1856, ch. 139, § 2, p. 219.) This means that in 1850, duress was no
defense to any murder. Thus, like many of California's early penal
statutes (see, e.g., *People v. Davis* (1998) 19 Cal.4th 301, 304, fn. 1
\[79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d 1165\] \[theft\]; *Keeler v. Superior
Court, supra,* 2 Cal.3d at pp. 624-625 \[murder\]), section 26
effectively adopted the common law, although the Legislature used a
problematic method in which to do so. The question before us is whether
the exception for a crime punishable with death changes with every
change in death penalty law, which would mean that by 1872, the
exception included only first degree murder and today it includes only
first degree murder with special circumstances. We think not, for
several reasons.

We see no suggestion that the 1850, or any, Legislature intended the
substantive law of duress to fluctuate with every change in death
penalty law. That interpretation would create strange anomalies. For
example, special circumstances were added to the murder laws in the
1970's to conform California's death penalty law to the requirements of
the United States Constitution. *(People v. Frierson* (1979) 25 Cal.3d
142, 173-175 \[158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587\].) Defendant's position
would mean that constitutional death penalty jurisprudence would control
the substantive law of duress, something we doubt the Legislature
intended. Even more anomalously, defendant's position would mean that
when the Legislature created special circumstances to give California a
valid death penalty law, it simultaneously *expanded* the circumstances
in which someone may kill an innocent person.

The presence or absence of special circumstances has no relationship to
whether duress should be a defense to killing an innocent person. For
example, because a prior murder conviction is a special circumstance (§
190.2, subd. (a)(2)), defendant's position would mean that a person with
a prior murder conviction who intentionally kills an innocent person
under duress without premeditating commits no crime, but if the person
premeditates, the killing is a capital crime. A person without the prior
conviction committing the same premeditated killing would commit no
crime unless some other special circumstance happened to attach, in
which case the killing would be a capital crime. The Legislature can
hardly have intended such random results.

Defendant's interpretation would also force prosecutors to charge
special circumstances to prevent duress from becoming a defense. As the
Court of Appeal said in this case, "a rule making the availability of
the duress defense turn on the manner in which prosecutorial discretion
is exercised is potentially pernicious, and may do an unnecessary
disservice to criminal defendants. The decision of whether to seek the
death penalty . . . should not be encumbered by tactical considerations,
such as blocking anticipated defenses. The charging decision must be
governed by more sagacious considerations than whether the punishment
charged will deprive a defendant of a defense to the crime."

Other statutory provisions lead to the conclusion that, like the common
law, section 26 excludes all murder from the duress defense. By itself,
section 26 (or its 1850 predecessor) is not clear whether the reference
to a "crime" punishable with death means the crime of murder in all its
forms or only those forms of murder punishable with death. But section
26 does not exist by itself. A court does not determine the meaning of a
statute from a single word or sentence but in context; provisions
relating to the same subject must be harmonized to the extent possible.
*(Lungren* v. *Deukmejian* (1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 \[248 Cal.Rptr.
115, 755 P.2d 299\].) Accordingly, a statute should be construed with
reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part. *(Landrum v.
Superior Court* (1981) 30 Cal.3d 1, 14 \[177 Cal.Rptr. 325, 634 P.2d
352\].) When read in conjunction with other statutes, it becomes clear
that section 26's reference to a "crime" means the crime of murder in
general and not just those forms of murder punishable with death at any
given time.

The original 1850 statute defining murder provided that the "punishment
of any person convicted of the *crime of murder* shall be death."
(Stats. 1850, ch. 99, § 21, p. 231, italics added.) The 1856 statute
that divided murder into degrees, with death the punishment only for
first degree murder---and thus, under defendant's position, the statute
that first abrogated the common law of duress---referred to determining
"the degree of the crime." (Stats. 1856, ch. 139, § 2, p. 219.) These
statutes thus indicate that the "crime" was and remained "murder" even
after it was divided into degrees.

Other statutes also indicate that the "crime" is "murder." Section 951
provides guidelines as to how to charge a crime in an information or
indictment. It states the pleading may simply "giv\[e\] the name of the
*crime,* as murder, burglary, etc. . . ." (Italics added.) An accusatory
pleading charging simply murder, without specifying the degree, is
sufficient to charge any degree of murder. *(In re Walker* (1974) 10
Cal.3d 764, 781 \[112 Cal.Rptr. 177, 518 P.2d 1129\]; *People* v.
*Mendez* (1945) 27 Cal.2d 20, 23 \[161 P.2d 929\].) Moreover, section
1157 provides that when "a defendant is convicted of a *crime* . . .
which is distinguished into degrees," the jury or court must find the
degree of the crime. (Italics added.) Both sections 951 and 1157 were
substantially identical in relevant respects in 1872, when section 26
was enacted. Section 1157 apparently has no antecedent before the 1872
Penal Code (but compare the 1856 law dividing murder into degrees, cited
in the preceding paragraph \[Stats. 1856, ch. 139, § 2, p. 219\]), but
section 951 derives from the 1850 law, which was similar as relevant
here.[^204] In accordance with these statutes, the information in this
case charged defendant simply with the crime of "murder." The jury then
found the crime to be first degree.

Thus, sections 951 and 1157 provide that the "crime" is "murder." In
light of those provisions, it is apparent that section 26 also refers to
the "crime" of murder, not a particular form of murder. Indeed, we have
explained that when, in 1856, the Legislature created the degrees of
murder, it merely "divide\[d\] the crime of murder into two degrees . .
. ." *(People v. Dillon* (1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 466 \[194 Cal.Rptr. 390,
668 P.2d 697\].) Moreover, we have explained that a special
circumstance, today necessary to permit the death penalty, is itself
"not a 'crime,' and an element of a special circumstance thus is not an
'element of a crime.'" *(People* v. *Garcia* (1984) 36 Cal.3d 539, 552
\[205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826\].) Even when special circumstances
are alleged, the substantive crime remains murder. Murder is punishable
with death, although not all forms of murder are so punishable. Here,
defendant was properly charged simply with murder. Hence, duress was no
defense to that charge.

Other provisions of the Penal Code bolster this conclusion. Sections 195
and 197, both enacted in 1872, describe those situations in which
homicide is excusable or justifiable. If the homicide is excusable or
justifiable under these provisions, the person must be acquitted. (§
199.) The original 1850 law had provisions comparable to, although
somewhat different from, sections 195 and 197. (Stats. 1850, ch. 99, §§
29-36, p. 232.) None of these provisions mention duress as excusing or
justifying homicide. It is unreasonable to suppose the Legislature
carefully described the situations in which homicide is excusable or
justifiable in those provisions, but also intended to create by oblique
implication in section 26 (or any other statute) yet another form of
excusable or justifiable homicide, especially when doing so would
abrogate the settled common law rule that duress is no defense to
killing an innocent person.

Moreover, no reason appears for the Legislature to have silently
abrogated the common law rule. The reasons for the rule applied as well
to 19th-century California as to Blackstone's England. They apply, if
anything, with greater force in California today. A person can always
choose to resist rather than kill an innocent person. The law must
encourage, even require, everyone to seek an alternative to killing.
Crimes are often committed by more than one person; the criminal law
must also, perhaps especially, deter those crimes. California today is
tormented by gang violence. If duress is recognized as a defense to the
killing of innocents, then a street or prison gang need only create an
internal reign of terror and murder can be justified, at least by the
actual killer. Persons who know they can claim duress will be more
likely to follow a gang order to kill instead of resisting than would
those who know they must face the consequences of their acts. Accepting
the duress defense for any form of murder would thus encourage killing.
Absent a stronger indication than the language of section 26, we do not
believe the Legislature intended to remove the sanctions of the criminal
law from the killing of an innocent even under duress.

Defendant cites *In re Boyle* (1974) 11 Cal.3d 165 \[113 Cal.Rptr. 99,
520 P.2d 723\] as supporting his position. *Boyle* interpreted former
California Constitution, article I, section 6, which then provided, "All
persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, *unless for capital
offenses* when the proof is evident or the presumption great." (Italics
added.) We held that only when defendants are actually death eligible
under the law applicable to that case are "capital offenses" involved
within the meaning of this provision. *(In re Boyle, supra,* 11 Cal.3d
at p. 167.) Other statutes involving procedural rules that depend on
whether the case is a capital case have generally also been interpreted
to apply only to actual capital cases under the applicable law. (E.g.,
former Pen. Code, § 1074, now Code Civ. Proc., § 229 \[specifying
grounds to challenge prospective jurors for cause\]; Pen. Code, § 1095
\[concerning the number of counsel permitted to argue\]; Pen. Code, §
1272 \[governing bail on appeal\]; see *Ex Parte Wolff* (1880) 57 Cal.
94; see also 4 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, *supra,* Pretrial
Proceedings, § 82, pp. 281-282.) Defendant argues that because what is a
capital offense for these purposes changes with changes in death penalty
law, so too does the law of duress.

We do not believe that these procedural provisions govern the
substantive law of duress. First, the procedural provisions generally
use different terminology than section 26 or its predecessor, which
refer to a "crime" punishable with death. The constitutional bail
provision construed in *Boyle* referred to "capital offenses." *(In re
Boyle, supra,* 11 Cal.3d at p. 167.) Former Penal Code section 1074,
subdivision 8, provided, "If the offense charged be punishable with
death . . . ." (The current Code Civ. Proc., § 229, subd. (h), uses
substantially equivalent language.) As enacted in 1872, Penal Code
section 1095 provided, "If the indictment is for an offense punishable
with death . . . ." (It is substantially identical today.) The statutes
governing bail at trial referred and still refer to someone "charged"
with an "offense punishable with death" or a "capital offense." (Pen.
Code, former § 1270, later § 1268a, now again § 1270; see also current §
1270.5.) The statute governing bail on appeal refers to "conviction of
an offense not punishable with death . . . ." (Pen. Code, § 1272.) None
of these provisions use the term "crime" and so shed no light on whether
the 1850 or 1872 Legislature meant simply the "crime" of murder or only
those forms of murder punishable with death at any given time. (An
exception now exists. By a 1974 initiative, the electorate amended the
constitutional bail provision so that it now refers to "\[c\]apital
crimes," not offenses. \[Cal. Const., art. I, § 12, as enacted Nov. 5,
1974.\] This 1974 change does not help us determine what the Legislature
intended in 1850 \[or 1872\].)

Moreover, without deciding how all procedural provisions should be
interpreted, we note that it generally makes sense for the procedures
prescribed for capital cases to apply only to an actual capital
case---hence, what is a capital case logically varies as the Legislature
changes the death penalty law. But the same rationale does not apply to
questions of *substantive* criminal law. It makes no sense, and creates
only anomalies, for the substantive law of duress to fluctuate with
every change in substantive death penalty law including, as with special
circumstances, changes constitutionally compelled for reasons irrelevant
to the law of duress.

Defendant and the concurring and dissenting opinion cite the principle
of statutory construction that where a reference to another law is
specific, the reference is to that law as it then existed and not as
subsequently modified, but where the reference is general, "such as \...
to a system or body of laws or to the general law relating to the
subject in hand," the reference is to the law as it may be changed from
time to time. *(Palermo* v. *Stockton Theatres, Inc.* (1948) 32 Cal.2d
53, 58-59 \[195 P.2d 1\]; also quoted in *In re Jovan B.* (1993) 6
Cal.4th 801, 816 \[25 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 863 P.2d 673\].) They argue that
section 26's reference to a "crime . . . punishable with death" is
general rather than specific. The question is not so clear. Section 26
does not cite specific statutes, but the subject of crimes punishable
with death is quite specific. It is, for example, far narrower than the
reference that the *Palermo* court found to be *specific* for this
purpose: " 'any treaty now existing between the government of the United
States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or
subject.' " *(Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc., supra,* 32 Cal.2d at
pp. 59-60.) In any event, when the statutory words themselves "do not
make clear whether \[the statute\] contemplates only a time-specific
incorporation, 'the determining factor will be . . . legislative intent.
. . *I" (In re Jovan B., supra,* at p. 816.) Here, for the reasons
stated, we believe the Legislature intended to refer to crimes
punishable with death as they existed in 1850.

The concurring and dissenting opinion also argues that duress especially
should be a defense to implied-malice second degree murder. It evokes
the image of an innocent person who is forced at gunpoint by fleeing
armed robbers to drive recklessly, and who is then charged with murder
when a fatal accident ensues. In reality, the situation is not so grim.
Although duress is not an affirmative defense to murder, the
circumstances of duress would certainly be relevant to whether the
evidence establishes the elements of implied malice minder. The reasons
a person acted in a certain way, including threats of death, are highly
relevant to whether the person acted with a conscious or wanton
disregard for human life. *(People v. Watson* (1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 300
\[179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279\].) This is not due to a special
doctrine of duress but to the requirements of implied malice murder.

Defendant argues that the rule of lenity compels a different result.
(See *People v. Avery* (2002) 27 Cal.4th 49, 57-58 \[115 Cal.Rptr.2d
403, 38 P.3d 1\].) We disagree. As explained in *Avery,* the rule of
lenity compels courts to resolve true statutory ambiguities in a
defendant's favor, but this rule applies only if two reasonable
interpretations of the statute stand in relative equipoise. Courts
should not strain to interpret a penal statute in a defendant's favor if
they can fairly discern a contrary legislative intent. Here, for the
reasons stated, the possible interpretations of section 26 do not stand
in relative equipoise. Reasonably construed, section 26 preserves the
common law rule that duress is not a defense to murder.

Defendant also cites legislative inaction in support of his position.
The Legislature amended section 26 in 1976 and again in 1981, both times
to delete a class of persons that the original statute had made
incapable of committing crimes. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1181, § 1, p. 5285
\[deleting the class of married women acting under threats by their
husbands\]; Stats. 1981, ch. 404, § 3, p. 1592 \[deleting the class of
"lunatics and insane persons"\].) Defendant argues that because the
Legislature did not also amend the provision relating to duress, it
"made the decision that not only should not all murderers be eligible
for the penalty of death, but not all should be deprived of the defense
of duress." Again, we disagree. "To be sure, where the Legislature
amends a statute without altering a consistent and long-standing
judicial interpretation of its operative language, courts generally
indulge in a presumption that the Legislature has ratified that
interpretation." *(People v. Escobar* (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 750-751 \[12
Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 837 P.2d 1100\].) But legislative inaction is a weak
indication of intent at best; it is generally more fruitful to examine
what the Legislature has done rather than not done. *(Id.* at p. 751.)
Here, there is no indication the Legislature even considered duress when
it amended section 26 in other areas. Moreover, when it did amend the
section, there was no long-standing and consistent judicial
interpretation that duress was a defense to some but not all murder,
only fleeting dicta in a single intermediate appellate court decision
that duress was a defense to all murder when there was no death penalty.

Accordingly, we conclude that duress is not a defense to any form of
murder.

B. *Whether Duress Can Reduce Murder to a Lesser Crime*

Defendant also argues that even if duress is not a complete defense to
murder, at least it reduces the crime to manslaughter by negating
malice.

"Manslaughter is 'the unlawful killing of a human being without malice.'
(§ 192.) A defendant lacks malice and is guilty of voluntary
manslaughter in 'limited, explicitly defined circumstances: either when
the defendant acts in a "sudden quarrel or heat of passion" (§ 192,
subd. (a)), or when the defendant kills in "unreasonable
self-defense"---the unreasonable but good faith belief in having to act
in self-defense (see *In re Christian S.* (1994) 7 Cal.4th 768 \[30
Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574\]; *People v. Flannel* \[(1979)\] 25 Cal.3d
668 \[160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1\]).' " *(People v. Blakeley* (2000)
23 Cal.4th 82, 87-88 \[96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675\].) Neither of
these two circumstances describes the killing of an innocent person
under duress. Nevertheless, defendant argues that we should make duress
a third way in which a defendant lacks malice.

No California case has recognized the killing of an innocent person
under duress as a form of manslaughter. Some states have provided by
statute that a killing under duress is manslaughter. (See Perkins &
Boyce, Criminal Law, *supra,* ch. 9, § 2, p. 1058 & fn. 18; LaFave,
Criminal Law, *supra,* § 7.11(c), pp. 719-720.) But California has not
done so. The cases that have considered the question absent a statute
have generally rejected the argument that duress can reduce murder to
manslaughter. (E.g., *U.S.* v. *LaFleur, supra,* 971 F.2d at p. 206;
*State* v. *Nargashian* (1904) 26 R.I. 299 \[58 A. 953, 955\] \[often
cited as a leading case on the subject\]; contra, *Wentworth v. State*
(1975) 29 Md.App. 110 \[349 A.2d 421, 428\].) Relying heavily on *People
v. Flannel, supra, 25* Cal.3d 668, and legal commentators, defendant
argues that this court should do what the Legislature has not done:
recognize a killing under duress as a form of manslaughter.

Some commentators do, indeed, argue that fear for one's own life,
although not justifying the killing of an innocent, should at least
mitigate murder to manslaughter. "\[T\]he holding that a killing in such
an extremity is necessarily murder has not been adequately considered.
While moral considerations require the rejection of any claim of excuse,
they do not require that the mitigation of the circumstances be
overlooked. A killing in such an extremity is far removed from
cold-blooded murder, and should be held to be manslaughter." (Perkins &
Boyce, Criminal Law, *supra,* ch. 9, § 2, p. 1058.) "\[I\]t is arguable
that \[a defendant's\] crime should be manslaughter rather than murder,
on the theory that the pressure upon him, although not enough to justify
his act, should serve at least to mitigate it to something less than
murder." (LaFave, Criminal Law, *supra,* § 7.11(c), p. 719.)

This court has never decided the question. (See *People v. Bacigalupo*
(1991) 1 Cal.4th 103, 124-125 \[2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 820 P.2d 559\]
\[concluding only that any error in not giving duress instructions was
harmless\]; *People v. Beardslee* (1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 86 \[279
Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311\] \[not deciding "what relevance, if any,"
*People v. Flannel, supra,* 25 Cal.3d 668, has in the duress context\].)
The problem with making a killing under duress a form of manslaughter is
that no statute so provides. The difference between murder and
manslaughter "is that murder includes, but manslaughter lacks, the
element of malice." *(People v. Rios* (2000) 23 Cal.4th 450, 460 \[97
Cal.Rptr.2d 512, 2 P.3d 1066\].) Both forms of voluntary manslaughter
currently recognized---provocation and imperfect self-defense---are
grounded in statutory language. The provocation form of manslaughter is
obviously based on statute. Section 192 "specifies\] that an unlawful
killing that lacks malice because committed 'upon a sudden quarrel or
heat of passion' is voluntary manslaughter." *(People v. Rios, supra,*
23 Cal.4th at p. 461; see also § 188 \[malice is "implied, when no
considerable provocation appears"\].)

Although less obviously, the imperfect self-defense form of manslaughter
is also based on statute. *People v. Flannel, supra, 25* Cal.3d 668, the
leading case developing the doctrine, "had two *independent* premises:
(1) the notion of mental capacity . . . and (2) a grounding in both
well-developed common law and in the statutory requirement of malice
(Pen. Code, § 187)." *(In re Christian S., supra, 1* Cal.4th at p.
*111.)* In 1981, the Legislature abolished diminished capacity, thus
making the first premise no longer valid. *(Ibid.)* But the second
premise remains valid. *(Ibid.)* Express malice exists "when there is
manifested a deliberate intention *unlawfully* to take away the life of
a fellow creature." (§ 188, italics added.) A killing in self-defense is
*lawful.* Hence, a person who actually, albeit unreasonably, believes it
is necessary to kill in self-defense intends to kill lawfully, not
unlawfully. "A person who actually believes in the need for self-defense
necessarily believes he is acting lawfully." *(In re Christian S.,
supra, 1* Cal.4th at p. 778.) Because express malice requires an *intent
to* kill unlawfully, a killing in the belief that one is acting lawfully
is not malicious. The statutory definition of implied malice does not
contain similar language, but we have extended the imperfect
self-defense rationale to any killing that would otherwise have malice,
whether express or implied. "\[T\]here is no valid reason to distinguish
between those killings that, absent unreasonable self-defense, would be
murder with express malice, and those killings that, absent unreasonable
self-defense, would be murder with implied malice." *(People v.
Blakeley, supra,* 23 Cal.4th at p. 89.)

Defendant's reliance on *People v. Flannel, supra, 25* Cal.3d 668, and
its recognition of unreasonable self-defense as a form of manslaughter,
is thus misplaced. A killing in self-defense is lawful, but a killing of
an innocent person under duress is unlawful. In contrast to a person
killing in imperfect self-defense, a person who kills an innocent
believing it necessary to save the killer's own life intends to kill
unlawfully, not lawfully. Nothing in the statutes negates malice in that
situation. Recognizing killing under duress as manslaughter would create
a new form of manslaughter, which is for the Legislature, not courts, to
do.

When this court developed the doctrine of diminished capacity as a form
of manslaughter, we rejected the argument that we were improperly
creating a nonstatutory crime: "In *People v. Conley* \[(1966)\] 64
Cal.2d 310 \[49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911\], we pointed out that
section 192 had been adopted before the concept of diminished capacity
had been developed and therefore that section's enumeration of
nonmalicious criminal homicides could not be considered exclusive. We
did not thereby create a 'non statutory crime,' nor could we do so
consistently with Penal Code section 6. Rather we gave effect to the
*statutory* definition of manslaughter by recognizing that factors other
than sudden quarrel or heat of passion may render a person incapable of
harboring malice." *(People* v. *Mosher* (1969) 1 Cal.3d 379, 385, fn. 1
\[82 Cal.Rptr. 379, 461 P.2d 659\].) This justification of diminished
capacity does not apply to duress. Sections 26, 187, and 192, all
enacted in 1872 and unchanged since as far as duress is concerned,
postdate the development of the law that duress does not justify killing
an innocent person. Moreover, the Legislature has now abolished the
doctrine of diminished capacity. *(In re Christian S., supra,* 7 Cal.4th
at p. 774; *People v. Saille* (1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103 \[2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364,
820 P.2d 588\].) Thus, we see no basis on which to create a new,
nonstatutory, form of voluntary manslaughter.

Two other circumstances also point to this conclusion. First, section
190.3 lists factors a jury should consider in deciding whether to impose
the death penalty when the defendant has been convicted of first degree
murder with special circumstances. Among the factors is whether the
defendant "acted under extreme duress . . . ." (§ 190.3, factor (g).)
This provision implies that a person acting even "under extreme duress"
may be convicted of first degree murder with special circumstances, an
implication inconsistent with the notion that duress reduces what would
otherwise be murder to manslaughter. Second, recognizing that duress
could reduce murder to manslaughter would create a conundrum with no
obvious solution. Manslaughter has always been a separate crime from
murder. Both section 187, defining murder, and section 192, defining
manslaughter, were enacted in 1872. They derive from the 1850 law.
(Stats. 1850, ch. 99, §§ 19-26, p. 231.) But manslaughter has never been
punishable by death. If a killing under duress were a form of
manslaughter, it would seem that the same duress would then provide a
*defense* to manslaughter. Thus, duress would become a complete defense
to murder by a two-step process: first, duress would reduce murder to
manslaughter; second, duress would supply a defense to that
manslaughter. These problems are for the Legislature to sort out if it
should choose to do so.

We recognize that policy arguments can be made that a killing out of
fear for one's own life, although not justified, should be a crime less
than the same killing without such fear. On the other hand, because
duress can often arise in a criminal gang context, the Legislature might
be reluctant to do anything to reduce the current law's deterrent effect
on gang violence. These policy questions are for the Legislature, not a
court, to decide. Accordingly, we reject defendant's argument that we
should create a new form of voluntary manslaughter. His arguments are
better directed to the Legislature.

Defendant also argues that, at least, duress can negate premeditation
and deliberation, thus resulting in second degree and not first degree
murder. We agree that a killing under duress, like any killing, may or
may not be premeditated, depending on the circumstances. If a person
obeys an order to kill without reflection, the jury might find no
premeditation and thus convict of second degree murder. As with implied
malice murder, this circumstance is not due to a special doctrine of
duress but to the legal requirements of first degree murder. The trial
court instructed the jury on the requirements for first degree murder.
It specifically instructed that a killing "upon a sudden heat of passion
or *other condition precluding the idea of* deliberation" would not be
premeditated first degree murder. (Italics added.) Here, the jury found
premeditation. In some other case, it might not. It is for the jury to
decide. But, unless and until the Legislature decides otherwise, a
malicious, premeditated killing, even under duress, is first degree
murder.

On a final point, we note, contrary to the Attorney General's argument,
that duress can, in effect, provide a defense to murder on a
felony-murder theory by negating the underlying felony. (See *People v.
Anderson* (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1646, 1666-1667, fn. 18 \[285 Cal.Rptr.
523\]; Perkins & Boyce, Criminal Law, *supra,* ch. 9, § 2, pp.
1058-1059; LaFave, Criminal Law, *supra,* § 5.3(b), pp. 468-469.) If one
is not guilty of the underlying felony due to duress, one cannot be
guilty of felony murder based on that felony. Here, for example, the
court instructed the jury that duress could be a defense to the
kidnapping charge. It also instructed on felony murder with kidnapping
as the underlying felony. If the jury had found defendant not guilty of
kidnapping due to duress (it did not), it could not have found that he
killed during the commission of that kidnapping. Defendant could not
have killed during the perpetration of a crime of which he was innocent.

Our conclusion that duress is no defense to murder makes it unnecessary
to decide whether the evidence would have warranted duress instructions
in this case.

III\. Conclusion

We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

George, C. J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J.,
concurred.

**^1^**By "innocent," we mean merely that the person did not cause the
duress, not that the person has never committed a crime.

**^5^** As originally enacted in 1872, section 951 provided that the
accusatory pleading might accuse the defendant "of the crime of (giving
its legal appellation, such as murder, arson, or the like \...)\...."
The 1850 antecedent provided that an indictment might accuse the
defendant "of the crime of (giving its legal appellation, such as
*Murder, Arson, Manslaughter,* or the like \...)\...." (Stats. 1850, ch.
119, § 259, p. 294, original italics.) As originally enacted in 1872,
section 1157 referred to "a crime \[that\] is distinguished into degrees
. . . ."

Under California law, the death penalty may be imposed for the crime of
murder only if the murder is of the first degree and committed with one
or more of the statutorily defined special circumstances. (Pen. Code, §§
190, 190.2.) California law allows a person accused of crime to defend
against any criminal charge on the ground that the defendant acted under
duress "unless the crime be punishable with death." *(Id.,* § 26, subd.
Six.) Here, defendant contends that, because the death penalty may not
be imposed for second degree murder, the trial court erred in not
instructing the jury that duress, if proven, was a complete defense to
second degree murder.

The majority concludes that the trial court did not err because, under
California law, duress is not a defense to second degree murder, or to
any form of murder, whether or not the particular form of murder is
punishable by death. I disagree. Applying established rules of statutory
construction, I would hold that duress is unavailable as a defense only
when the offense is capital murder---that is, first degree murder with a
special circumstance--- and that duress is available as a defense to all
noncapital forms of murder, including murder in the second degree.
Because no substantial evidence of duress was presented here, however, I
agree with the majority that defendant was not entitled to have the
trial court instruct the jury on that defense.

When deciding what a statute means, courts seek to determine what effect
the legislative body that enacted it intended to achieve. *(People v.
Trevino* (2001) 26 Cal.4th 237, 240 \[109 Cal.Rptr.2d 567, 27 P.3d
283\].) To make this determination, courts begin with the text of the
statute, because the words used are the best evidence of legislative
intent. *(Id.* at p. 241; see also *Holloway* v. *United States* (1999)
526 U.S. 1, 6 \[119 S.Ct. 966, 969, 143 L.Ed.2d 1\].) Unless there is
reason to believe that a special or technical meaning was intended,
courts give the words of the statute their usual, ordinary meaning.
*(People v. Trevino, supra,* at p. 241.) If the statutory text, viewed
in light of the ordinary meaning of its words, is not ambiguous, courts
usually accept this meaning as the proper construction of the statute
without further inquiry. *(People v. Gardeley* (1996) 14 Cal.4th .605,
621 \[59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713\].) If the statutory text is
ambiguous, however, courts examine the context of the statute and
consider its legislative history and the historical circumstances of its
enactment to arrive at the interpretation that is most likely to reflect
legislative intent. *(Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. County of
Stanislaus* (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1143, 1152 \[69 Cal.Rptr.2d 329, 947 P.2d
291\].)

Here, the provision to be construed, subdivision Six of Penal Code
section 26 (section 26), includes among the persons who are incapable of
committing crimes "\[pjersons *(unless the crime be punishable with
death)* who committed the act or made the omission charged under threats
or menaces sufficient to show that they had reasonable cause to and did
believe their lives would be endangered if they refused." (Italics
added.) As applied to the crime of murder, the italicized phrase is
ambiguous because some but not all forms of murder are punishable by
death.

The crime of murder is divided into first degree murder and second
degree murder. (Pen. Code, § 189.) Second degree murder is never
punishable by death, and first degree murder is punishable by death only
if committed under one or more special circumstances. *(Id.,* §§ 190,
190.2; see *People v. Bacigalupo* (1993) 6 Cal.4th 457, 467-470 \[24
Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 862 P.2d 808\] \[describing California death penalty
law\].) This court has stated that "\[i\]n the California scheme the
special circumstance is not just an aggravating factor: it is a fact or
set of facts, found beyond reasonable doubt . . . which *changes the
crime* from one punishable by imprisonment of 25 years to life *to one
which must be punished either by death* or life imprisonment without
possibility of parole." *(People v. Superior Court (Engert)* (1982) 31
Cal.3d 797, 803 \[183 Cal.Rptr. 800, 647 P.2d 76\], italics added.)
Thus, it is the pleading and proof of special circumstances that make
murder a crime punishable by death. Considering only the ordinary
meaning of the words appearing in section 26, making duress unavailable
as a defense to a "crime . . . punishable by death," this could mean
either, as the majority concludes, that duress is unavailable as a
defense to any form of murder, or, as I conclude, that duress is
unavailable only when the crime is capital murder--- that is, first
degree murder with at least one special circumstance.

This ambiguity is resolved by applying two well-established rules of
statutory construction. The first of these rules is used to determine
whether a statutory provision mentioned in another provision is
incorporated only in its contemporary form or instead as it might later
be changed from time to time. The rule is this: If the reference to the
other law is specific, as to a particular code provision by section
number, then the referenced provision is incorporated only as it then
existed, but if instead the reference is general, " 'such as . . . to a
system or body of laws or to the general law relating to the subject in
hand, the referring statute takes the law or laws referred to not only
in their contemporary form, but also as they may be changed from time to
time . . . . \[Citations.\]'" *(Palmero v. Stockton Theatres, Inc.*
(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 59 \[195 P.2d 1\]; accord, *People v. Cooper*
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 38, 44 \[115 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 37 P.3d 403\]; *Kirk v.
Rhoads* (1873) 46 Cal. 398, 402; *Pearce v. Director, Office of
Workers', etc.* (9th Cir. 1979) 603 F.2d 763, 767; 2B Singer, Sutherland
Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th ed. 2000) § 51.07, p. 270.)

Section 26, making duress a defense "unless the crime be punishable with
death," implicitly incorporates by reference other statutory provisions
defining crimes and prescribing their punishments. Section 26's
reference to other statutory provisions is general rather than specific.
A specific reference would identify by name or by the Penal Code section
the crimes to which duress is not a defense. By instead referring
generally to "a crime not punishable with death," the Legislature
expressed an intention to incorporate the general body of law relating
to capital punishment as it might change from time to time.

The question remains, however, whether, as applied to the crime of
murder, the phrase "crime . . . punishable with death" in section 26
means murder in all its forms or only capital murder.

This question is best answered by applying another settled rule of
statutory construction, long accepted by both this court and the United
States Supreme Court: "A term appearing in several places in a statutory
text is generally read the same way each time it appears." *(Ratzlaf v.
U.S.* (1994) 510 U.S. 135, 143 \[114 S.Ct. 655, 660, 126 L.Ed.2d 615\];
accord, *People v. McCart* (1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 344 \[185 Cal.Rptr.
284, 649 P.2d 926\]; *Hoag v. Howard* (1880) 55 Cal. 564, 565.) Here,
the Legislature adopted the original Penal Code of 1872 as a single
statutory text, and references to crimes "punishable by death" appear in
several places in that text. Until now, this court has consistently
interpreted this phrase as excluding all noncapital forms of murder.

For example, section 1095 of the original Penal Code provided that
"\[i\]f the indictment is for an offense punishable with death, two
counsel on each side may argue the cause to the jury." This provision
has since been amended to eliminate the reference to indictment, but its
substance remains unchanged. This court has construed Penal Code section
1095 as allowing two counsel to argue for the defendant only in capital
cases. *(People v. Darling* (1962) 58 Cal.2d 15, 19 \[22 Cal.Rptr. 484,
372 P.2d 316\]; *People v. Ah Wee* (1874) 48 Cal. 236, 238.) Section
1270 of the original Penal Code provided that "\[a\] defendant charged
with an offense punishable with death cannot be admitted to bail, when
the proof of his guilt is evident or the presumption thereof great.
\..." In 1880, this court held that a defendant charged with murder was
entitled to bail when the evidence showed that the offense was at most
second degree murder, because second degree murder was not a capital
crime. *(Ex Parte Wolff* (1880) 57 Cal. 94; see also *Ex parte Brown*
(1885) 68 Cal. 176 \[8 P. 829\]; 4 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law
(3d ed. 2000) Pretrial Proceedings, § 82, p. 281.) Section 1272 of the
original Penal Code provides for bail on appeal "\[a\]fter conviction of
an offense not punishable with death . . . ." This court has construed
section 1272 as giving the court discretion to grant bail on appeal when
the defendant is convicted of a noncapital offense like second degree
murder. (See *In re Podesto* (1976) 15 Cal.3d 921, 929 \[127 Cal.Rptr.
97, 544 P.2d 1297\]; *Ex parte Brown, supra,* 68 Cal. at p. 182; *People
v. Superior Court (Roam)* (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1220, 1230 \[82
Cal.Rptr.2d 119\].)

Thus, two established rules of statutory construction resolve the
ambiguity in section 26 concerning the availability of duress as a
defense to murder. In making duress unavailable for a "crime . . .
punishable with death," the Legislature intended to bar the defense only
as to those murders for which capital punishment was authorized as
punishment when the murder was committed. Under current law, the
category includes only first degree murders with special circumstances.
This conclusion is consistent with every published decision that has in
any way spoken to the issue. (See *Tapia v. Roe* (9th Cir. 1999) 189
F.3d 1052, 1057 \[stating that "\[a\]s defined by California law, duress
can excuse crimes, including murder without special circumstances . .
."\]; *People v. Petro* (1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 245, 248 \[56 P.2d 984\]
\[stating that duress is unavailable "where the crime charged may be
punished with death, and the evidence clearly shows that the death
penalty may be imposed"\]; see also *People v. Beardslee* (1991) 53
Cal.3d 68, 85 \[279 Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311\] \[quoting with
apparent approval a standard jury instruction stating that duress is
unavailable " '\[w\]here a person commits first degree murder with a
special circumstance' "\]; *People v. Moran* (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 398,
416 \[114 Cal.Rptr. 413\] \[holding evidence failed to prove duress as a
matter of law, thereby implying duress can be a defense to noncapital
murder\]; *People* v. *Son* (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 224, 232, fn. 9 \[93
Cal.Rptr.2d 871\], quoting *People v. Petro, supra,* at p. 248.)

II

To resolve the ambiguity in section 26's reference to a "crime . . .
punishable by death," the majority uses an entirely different reasoning
process. The majority traces the history of section 26. Although section
26 was enacted in 1872 as part of the original Penal Code, the majority
construes it as a continuation of an even earlier provision, enacted in
1850 as section 10 of the Act Concerning Crimes and Punishments (the
1850 Act).

The majority asserts that the 1850 Legislature intended to codify a
common law exception to the defense of duress and to make duress forever
unavailable as a defense to the crimes that in 1850 were punishable with
death, regardless of any later changes in laws relating to capital
punishment. I disagree with these assertions.

The majority is wrong in asserting that section 10 of the 1850 Act
merely codified a common law exception to the defense of duress for the
killing of an innocent person. The majority quotes only the last
sentence of the following explanation by Blackstone: "Another species of
compulsion or necessity is what our law calls duress *per minas* (by
threats), or threats and menaces, which induce a fear of death or other
bodily harm, and which take away for that reason the guilt of many
crimes and misdemeanors, at least before the human tribunal. But then
that fear, which compels a man to do an unwarrantable action, ought to
be just and well-grounded; such, *'qui cadere possit in virum
constantem, non timidum et meticulosum* (as might seize a courageous man
not timid or fearful),' as Bracton expresses it, in the words of the
civil law. Therefore, in time of war or rebellion, a man may be
justified in doing many treasonable acts by compulsion of the enemy or
rebels, which would admit of no excuse in time of peace. This, however,
seems only, or at least principally, to hold as to positive crimes, so
created by the laws of society, and which, therefore, society may
excuse; but not as to natural offenses, so declared by the law of God,
wherein human magistrates are only the executioners of divine
punishment. And, therefore, though a man be violently assaulted, and
hath no other possible means of escaping death, but by killing an
innocent person, this fear and force shall not acquit him of murder; for
he ought rather to die himself than escape by the murder of an
innocent." (2 Jones's Blackstone (1916) p. 2197, fiis. omitted.)

Thus, as Blackstone explained, under the common law duress was a defense
to treason but not to murder because the former was merely a "positive
crime" established by the laws of society while the latter was a
"natural offense" established by the law of God. But California law has
never drawn this distinction between positive and natural crimes, and
the 1850 Legislature, by specifying death as the punishment for both
treason and murder, made duress unavailable as a defense to either. "A
code section is presumed to be a continuation of the common law only
when it and the common law are *substantially* the same." *(People* v.
*Valentine* (1946) 28 Cal.2d 121, 142 \[169 P.2d 1\], italics added.)
Because the availability of the duress defense under the 1850 Act was
not substantially the same as under the common law, there can be no
presumption that section 10 of the 1850 Act is a continuation of the
common law.

Nor do I agree with the majority that the 1850 Legislature intended
duress to remain unavailable as a defense to all those crimes, and only
those crimes, that in 1850 were punishable with death, regardless of any
later changes in laws relating to capital punishment. As explained
above, a general rather than specific statutory reference to other law
incorporates the referenced law as it may change over time. *(Palmero v.
Stockton Theatres, Inc., supra,* 32 Cal.2d at p. 59.) The language of
section 10 of the 1850 Act making duress a defense to "a crime not
punishable with death," like the language of current section 26 making
duress a defense "unless the crime be punishable with death," is a
general rather than a specific reference to other laws concerning
capital punishment. Had the 1850 Legislature wanted to exclude the
effects of later changes in the scope of capital punishment, it need
only have referred by name to the three crimes that the 1850 Act made
punishable by death---murder, treason, and perjury procuring an innocent
person's execution---or to the sections of the 1850 Act defining those
crimes.

Attempting to cast doubt on this conclusion, the majority asserts that
section 26's reference to a "crime . . . punishable with death" may be
considered a specific reference because it is "far narrower" than the
reference found to be specific in *Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc.,
supra,* 32 Cal.2d 53. (Maj. opn., *ante,* at p. 779.) At issue there was
a provision of the California Alien Land Act (Stats. 1921, p. lxxxiii)
as amended in 1923 (Stats. 1923, p. 1021), under which a corporation
owned by Japanese nationals could lease land " 'to the extent and for
the purposes prescribed by any treaty now existing between the . . .
United States' and Japan." *(Palermo* v. *Stockton Theatres, Inc,
supra,* at p. 55.) This court said that the question whether this
reference to "any treaty now existing" is general or specific "might, as
an abstract proposition, admit of different opinions" *(id.* at p. 59),
but that this court was "constrained to hold that reference is specific"
because there was "grave doubt whether our Legislature could
constitutionally delegate to the treaty-making authority of the United
States the right and power thus directly to control our local
legislation with respect to future acts" *(id.* at p. 60).

Section 26's reference to a "crime . . . punishable by death" is in no
way similar to the Alien Land Act's reference to "any treaty now
existing" between the United States and Japan. Most obviously, section
26 does not refer to a crime *now* punishable with death, but simply to
a crime punishable by death. The word "now" is a strong indication that
the Legislature, when it adopted and amended the Alien Land Act, was
referring to treaties then in existence and not to treaties that might
later come into force. In addition, the reference to a "treaty" is a
reference to a specific legislative act rather to a general body of law.
By comparison, section 26 does not refer to a "statute" or "section" or
"law" prescribing the penalty of death but instead, more generally and
simply, to a "crime . . . punishable with death." Finally, recognizing
that section 26's reference is general rather than specific does not
raise any grave doubts about its validity. Thus, upon examination, this
court's decision in *Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc., supra,* 32
Cal.2d 53, provides no support for the majority.

The majority makes no effort to compare section 26's reference language
with other reference language that the courts of this state have found
to be general rather than specific. For example, in 1873 this court
concluded that a reference in a city's act of incorporation to "all the
provisions of law in force regulating elections" was a general reference
incorporating state election law as it might change over time. *(Kirk*
v. *Rhoads, supra,* 46 Cal. 398, 402-403.) More recently, this court
concluded that the reference in Welfare and Institutions Code section
726 to the "maximum term of imprisonment" for an offense was a general
reference to the determinate sentencing law. *(In re Jovan B.* (1993) 6
Cal.4th 801, 816 \[25 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 863 P.2d 673\].) And the Court of
Appeal, in an opinion authored by Justice Chin, concluded that the
reference in Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision
(c), to the "good behavior and participation credit provisions of
Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of
Part 3 of the Penal Code" was a general reference to a system or body of
laws. *(People v. Eddy* (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1106 \[38
Cal.Rptr.2d 563\].) Finally, this court has construed references to
crimes "punishable with death" in other provisions of the Penal Code as
referring to the capital punishment laws in effect when the crime was
committed, not when the provision was first enacted. *(People* v.
*Darling, supra,* 58 Cal.2d at p. 19; *Ex Parte Wolff, supra,* 57 Cal.
94; *In re Podesto, supra,* 15 Cal.3d at p. 929.) Examination of these
other decisions further confirms that section 26's reference to a "crime
. . . punishable with death" is general rather than specific.

The majority broadly asserts that the 1850 Legislature must have
intended to exclude the effects of later changes in capital punishment
law because there is no reason why the Legislature would have wanted the
availability of the duress defense to vary over time as the Legislature
expanded or contracted the category of crimes punishable with death.

The majority's assertion is belied by the very words of the provision
this court is construing. In 1850, when it enacted the 1850 Act, and
again in 1872, when it enacted the original Penal Code, the Legislature
declared duress to be a defense to all crimes except those "punishable
with death." This language reflects the Legislature's decision to link
the availability of the duress defense with the laws prescribing death
as a punishment for crime.

The Legislature's decisions whether to allow a duress defense and
whether to authorize the death penalty both reflect societal judgments
about the seriousness of the offense in question. In the first instance,
the societal judgment is whether an offense-is so serious that an
individual is expected to forfeit his or her life rather than commit it.
In the second instance, the societal judgment is whether an offense is
so serious that a person who has committed it should forfeit his or her
life. The Legislature could reasonably have concluded that the same
small category of highly serious offenses that warranted capital
punishment could not be excused by a claim of duress. Also, if duress is
not a defense to a noncapital crime, then the law has created a
situation in which one is better off breaking the law than obeying it
because by committing the crime one risks only a prison sentence, while
by refusing to commit the crime one risks death or very serious injury
from the person imposing the duress. The Legislature may well have
concluded that a just system of laws does not place those who obey the
law in a worse position than those who break it.

The majority acknowledges that under an established rule of statutory
construction a term appearing in several places in a statutory text
should be given the same meaning throughout. (See *Ratzlaf v. U.S.,
supra,* 510 U.S. at p. 143 \[114 S.Ct. at p. 660\].) But the majority
offers two reasons for not applying the rule here: because section 26
refers to a "crime" that is "punishable with death" whereas other
provisions of the Penal Code refer to an "offense" that is so
punishable, and because the other provisions define the scope of
procedural rights rather than substantive defenses. Neither of these
suggested reasons is persuasive.

It makes no difference that the other provisions refer to "offenses"
punishable with death rather than to "crimes" punishable with death.
This court has stated that " 'the word "offense" and the word "crime"
hav\[e\] the same legal significance.' " *(Doble* v. *Superior Court*
(1925) 197 Cal. 556, 571 \[241 P. 852\]; see also Pen. Code, § 15
\[giving a single definition for the words *crime* and *public
offense\].)* The rule of statutory construction that phrases repeated in
a statute are presumed to have the same meaning throughout applies not
only when the words are identical but also when the words are
equivalent. *(Cohen v. De la Cruz* (1998) 523 U.S. 213, 220 \[118 S.Ct.
1212, 1217, 140 L.Ed.2d 341\].)

Nor is there any support for the majority's distinction between
procedural and substantive purposes of the references in different
provisions of the Penal Code to a crime "punishable by death." The
majority bases that distinction on its assumption that although it is
reasonable and logical to distinguish capital and noncapital forms of
murder for purposes of procedural rights, it is not logical and
reasonable to distinguish capital and noncapital forms of murder for
purposes of defining when the defense of duress is available and when it
is not available. As I have explained, there is nothing unreasonable or
illogical about linking the availability of the duress defense to the
seriousness of the charge as reflected in the laws governing capital
punishment.

Ill

The majority appears to argue that this court *must* construe section 26
as not permitting the defense of duress to any form of murder because
sound considerations of public policy require that no amount of threats
or menaces can justify the taking of innocent human life. In my view,
such public policy considerations have a very limited role to play in
the process of statutory construction. In general, this court may not
substitute its public policy views for those of the Legislature under
the guise of statutory construction. When the language of a statute is
ambiguous, however, this court may prefer a resolution of the ambiguity
that avoids absurd consequences or that no reasonable legislative body
could have intended. *(People* v. *Rubalcava* (2000) 23 Cal.4th 322, 328
\[96 Cal.Rptr.2d 735, 1 P.3d 52\].)

Here, a construction of section 26 that makes the defense of duress
unavailable as to capital murder but available as to noncapital murder
does not produce results that are absurd or that no reasonable
legislative body could have intended. On the contrary, the question of
the proper boundaries or limits on the defense of duress is one on which
reasonable minds can differ and have differed, and the construction of
section 26 that I have arrived at by applying well-established rules of
statutory construction represents a moderate approach in line with
mainstream legal thinking.

For example, the Model Penal Code allows the defense of duress to be
asserted against *all* criminal charges, including murder. (Model Pen.
Code, § 2.09.) Under the Model Penal Code's formulation of the defense,
duress is a defense whenever "a person of reasonable firmness in \[the
defendant's\] situation would have been unable to resist." *(Id.,* §
209, subd. (1).) In the official comment to this provision, the American
Law Institute explains that "persons of reasonable firmness surely break
at different points depending on the stakes that are involved"; it
further observes "that even homicide may sometimes be the product of
coercion that is truly irresistible, that danger to a loved one may have
greater impact on a person of reasonable firmness than a danger to
himself, and, finally, that long and wasting pressure may break down
resistance more effectively than a threat of immediate destruction."
(Model Pen. Code & Commentaries, com. 3 to § 209, p. 376.)

The states of Connecticut, New York, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and
Utah have adopted statutes similar to the Model Penal Code allowing
duress as a defense to homicide. (See Rutkowski, *A Coercion Defense for
the Street Gang Criminal: Plugging the Moral Gap in Existing Law* (1996)
10 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics and Pub. Pol'y 137, 205, fn. 332.) Also, the
laws of most civil law countries---including Belgium, Greece, the
Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden---recognize duress as a
defense to any crime, including murder. (Swaak-Goldman, *International
Decision: Prosecutor v. Erdemovic, Judgement* (1998) 92 Am. J. Internat.
L. 282, 284, fn. 14.)

As a leading commentator on the law of duress has stated, "\[d\]uress
always is a matter of line drawing about which reasonable minds can
differ" (Dressier, *Exegesis of the Law of Duress: Justifying the Excuse
and Searching for Its Proper Limits* (1989) 62 So.Cal. L.Rev. 1331,
1367). Indeed, the weight of scholarly commentary favors the Model Penal
Code's definition of duress and its abolition of the common law murder
exception to the duress defense. (See Alexander, *A Unified Excuse of
Preemptive Self Protection* (1999) 74 Notre Dame L.Rev. 1475, 1488;

Duress, and American Nationality Law* (1982) 82 Colum. L.Rev. 120, 142,

I do not here suggest that the Legislature should adopt the Model Penal
Code approach, under which duress is available as a defense to any
crime, including capital murder. I suggest only that a construction of
section 26 under which duress is a defense to noncapital murder, but not
to capital murder, represents a moderate, middle-of-the road approach
that a legislative body plausibly could have adopted to resolve a
difficult and complex issue on which reasonable minds may differ.

The majority's discussion appears to assume that murder necessarily
involves a *choice* to take an innocent life. Second degree murder,
however, does not require an intent to kill. A person who engages in a
provocative act (see *People v. Nieto Benitez* (1992) 4 Cal.4th 91,
107-108 \[13 Cal.Rptr.2d 864, 840 P.2d 969\]) or who drives with great
recklessness (see *People v. Watson* (1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 297-299 \[179
Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279\]) may be convicted of second degree murder
under an implied malice theory. Yet, under the majority's construction,
section 26 does not allow a duress defense even in situations of
unintentional implied malice killings.

Imagine, for example, this scenario: Two armed robbers fleeing the scene
of a store robbery force their way into a car that is leaving the
parking lot. One robber holds a gun to the ¿river's head, while the
other places a gun against the head of the driver's wife. They order the
driver to take off at high speed and not to stop or \"slow down for stop
signs or signal lights, threatening immediate death to the driver and
his wife. If the driver complies, and an accident ensues resulting in
the death of an innocent person, the driver could be prosecuted for
second degree murder on an implied malice theory, and, under the
majority's construction of section 26, the driver could not assert
duress as a defense. I doubt that our Legislature intended to withhold
the defense of duress under these or similar circumstances.

The majority expresses concern that if defendants can assert a duress
defense to noncapital murder, the defense may be used to excuse killings
by gang members. But most if not all gang-motivated killings are capital
murder because it is a special circumstance that "the defendant
intentionally killed the victim while the defendant was an active
participant in a criminal street gang . . . and the murder was carried
out to further the activities of the criminal street gang." (Pen. Code,
§ 190.2, subd. (a)(22).) Moreover, the defense of duress is not
available to a defendant who recklessly or intentionally placed himself
in a situation where coercion to commit criminal acts could reasonably
be anticipated. Because persons who join criminal street gangs or
terrorist organizations can anticipate pressure to commit crimes, the
defense would usually be unavailable to those individuals. (See *State
v. Scott* (1992) 250 Kan. 350 \[827 P.2d 733, 739-740\] \[defendant who
voluntarily joined drug-selling organization barred from asserting
duress when coerced into torturing fellow gang member\]; Rutkowski, *A
Coercion Defense for the Street Gang Criminal: Plugging the Moral Gap in
Existing Law, supra,* 10 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol'y at p. 186,
fn. 239 \["Most jurisdictions hold that intentionally placing oneself in
the position where one would likely be the subject of coercion will
defeat a duress defense."\].)

IV

Because, as I have concluded, duress is a defense to noncapital murder,
a defendant charged with noncapital murder is entitled to a jury
instruction on the defense if there is substantial evidence to support
it. This means " 'evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable
\[people\] could have concluded that there was \[duress\] sufficient to
negate the requisite criminal intent.'" *(People* v. *Flannel* (1979) 25
Cal.3d 668, 685 \[160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1\], quoting *People v.
Carr* (1972) 8 Cal.3d 287, 294 \[104 Cal.Rptr. 705, 502 P.2d 513\].)
Under section 26, the defense of duress is only available to defendants
who present evidence of threats or menace sufficient to show a
reasonable and actual belief that their life was presently and
immediately endangered if participation was refused. *(People v. Perez*
(1973) 9 Cal.3d 651, 657 \[108 Cal.Rptr. 474, 510 P.2d 1026\]; *People
v. Quinlan* (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 1063, 1068 \[88 Cal.Rptr. 125\].)

Here, defendant failed to present substantial evidence of duress. He
testified that Ron Kiem told him, "Give me the rock or I'll beat the
shit out of you" and that he complied because he feared that Kiem, a
stronger and bigger man, would beat him severely. Yet, Kiem did not
threaten him with death, and there was no history of violence between
the two men despite their long acquaintance. In addition, defendant
voluntarily joined Kiem in the initial attack on the victim, thereby
placing himself in the situation where he should have anticipated that
Kiem would pressure him to commit further acts of violence. Throughout
the day, defendant made no use of opportunities to leave Kiem and to
obtain help for the victim.

Because defendant presented insufficient evidence of duress to warrant a
jury instruction on that defense, I agree with the majority that the
Court of Appeal properly affirmed defendant's conviction.

Conclusion

Under California law, duress is a defense to any criminal charge "unless
the crime be punishable with death." (§ 26.) According to the majority,
this means that duress is never a defense to murder, even though
California law restricts the death penalty to first degree murders with
special circumstances. The majority reaches its result largely by
applying a maxim---no amount of duress excuses the taking of innocent
human life---that it treats as an infallible solution to a profound
moral quandary. I cannot agree, not only because the majority's maxim is
not a fair reading of the far different statutory language, but also
because the majority oversimplifies a highly complex issue. I would
adopt a statutory construction more consistent with the ordinary meaning
of the statutory text, barring the defense of duress only as to capital
murder and other capital crimes, and leaving to the jury in all other
situations the question whether duress excuses an otherwise criminal
act.

**THE QUEEN v. DUDLEY AND STEPHENS**

**December 9, 1884**

**\[ ... \]**

At the trial**\[ ... \]**, the jury, at the suggestion of the learned
judge, found the facts of the case in a special verdict which stated

> "that, on July 5,1884, the prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edward

**\[ ... \]**

LORD COLERIDGE, C.J. The two prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edwin
Stephens, were indicted for the murder of Richard Parker on the high
seas on the 25th of July in the present year. They were tried before my
Brother Huddleston at Exeter on the 6th of November, and, under the
direction of my learned Brother, the jury returned a special verdict,
the legal effect of which has been argued before us, and on which we are
now to pronounce judgment.

**\[ ... \]** From these facts, stated with the cold precision of a
special verdict, it appears sufficiently that the prisoners were subject
to terrible temptation, to sufferings which might break down the bodily
power of the strongest man, and try the conscience of the best. Other
details yet more harrowing, facts still more loathsome and appalling,
were presented to the jury, and are to be found recorded in my learned
Brother\'s notes. But nevertheless this is clear, that the prisoners put
to death a weak and unoffending boy upon the chance of preserving their
own lives by feeding upon his flesh and blood after he was killed, and
with the certainty of depriving him, of any possible chance of survival.
The verdict finds in terms that \"if the men had not fed upon the body
of the boy they would probably not have survived,\" and that "the boy
being in a much weaker condition was likely to have died before them.\"
They might possibly have been picked up next day by a passing ship; they
might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is
obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and
profitless act. It is found by the verdict that the boy was incapable of
resistance, and, in fact, made none; and it is not even suggested that
his death was due to any violence on his part attempted against, or even
so much as feared by, those who killed him. Under these circumstances
the jury say that they are ignorant whether those who killed him were
guilty of murder, and have referred it to this Court to determine what
is the legal consequence which follows from the facts which they have
found.

**\[ ... \]**

It was further objected that**\[ ... \]** there was no jurisdiction in
the Court at Exeter to try these prisoners. But **\[ ... \]**17 & 18
Vict. c. 104, s. 267, is absolutely fatal to this objection. By that
section it is enacted as follows: \-- "All offences against property or
person committed in or at any place either ashore or afloat, out of her
Majesty\'s dominions by any master seaman or apprentice who at the time
when the offence is committed is or within three months previously has
been employed in any British ship, shall be deemed to be offences of the
same nature respectively, and be inquired of, heard, tried, determined,
and adjudged in the same manner and by the same courts and in the same
places as if such offences had been committed within the jurisdiction of
the Admiralty of England." We are all therefore of opinion that this
objection likewise must be overruled.

There remains to be considered the real question in the case whether
killing under the circumstances set forth in the verdict be or be not
murder. The contention that it could be anything else was, to the minds
of us all, both new and strange, and we stopped the Attorney General in
his negative argument in order that we might hear what could be said in
support of a proposition which appeared to us to be at once dangerous,
immoral, and opposed to all legal principle and analogy. **\[ ... \]**
First it is said that it follows from various definitions of murder in
books of authority, which definitions imply, if they do not state, the
doctrine, that in order to save your own life you may lawfully take away
the life of another, when that other is neither attempting nor
threatening yours, nor is guilty of any illegal act whatever towards you
or any one else. But if these definitions be looked at they will not be
found to sustain this contention. **\[ ... \]**

It is, if possible, yet clearer that the doctrine contended for receives
no support from the great authority of Lord Hale. It is plain that in
his view the necessity which justified homicide is that only which has
always been and is now considered a justification. **\[ ... \]** Lord
Hale regarded the private necessity which justified, and alone
justified, the taking the life of another for the safeguard of one\'s
own to be what is commonly called "self-defence." (Hale\'s Pleas of, the
Crown, i. 478.)

But if this could be even doubtful upon Lord Hale\'s words, Lord Hale
himself has made it clear. For in the chapter in which he deals with the
exemption created by compulsion or necessity he thus expresses himself:
"If a man be desperately assaulted and in peril of death, and cannot
otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his assailant\'s fury, he will kill
an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force will not
acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit the fact,
for he ought rather to die himself than kill an innocent; but if he
cannot otherwise save his own life the law permits him in his own
defence to kill the assailant, for by the violence of the assault, and
the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself, the law of
nature, and necessity, hath made him his own protector cum debito modera
mine inculpatee tutelae.\" (Hale\'s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. i. 51.)

But, further still, Lord Hale in the following chapter deals with the
position asserted by the casuists, and sanctioned, as he says, by
Grotius and Puffendorf, that in a case of extreme necessity, either of
hunger or clothing; \"theft is no theft, or at least not punishable as
theft, as some even of our own lawyers have asserted the same.\"
\"But,\" says Lord Hale, \"I take it that herein England, that rule, at
least by the laws of England, is false; and therefore, if a person,
being under necessity for want of victuals or clothes, shall upon that
account clandestinely and animo furandi steal another man\'s goods, it
is felony, and a crime by the laws of England punishable with death.\"
(Hale, Pleas of the Crown, i. 54.) If, therefore, Lord Hale is clear \--
as he is \-- that extreme necessity of hunger does not justify larceny,
what would he have said to the doctrine that it justified murder?

**\[ ... \]**

The one real authority of former time is Lord Bacon, who**\[ ... \]**
lays down the law as follows:\" Necessity carrieth a privilege in
itself. Necessity is of three sorts \-- necessity of conservation of
life, necessity of obedience, and necessity of the act of God or of a
stranger. First of conservation of life ; if a man steal viands to
satisfy his present hunger, this is no felony nor larceny. So if divers
be in danger of drowning by the casting away of some boat or barge, and
one of them get to some plank, or on the boat\'s side to keep himself
above water, and another to save his life thrust him from it, whereby he
is drowned, this is neither se defendendo nor by misadventure, but
justifiable.\"**\[ ... \]** Lord Bacon was great even as a lawyer; but
it is permissible to much smaller men, relying upon principle and on the
authority of others, the equals and even the superiors of Lord Bacon as
lawyers, to question the soundness of his dictum. There are many
conceivable states of things in which it might possibly be true, but if
Lord Bacon meant to lay down the broad proposition that a man may save
his life by killing, if necessary, an innocent and unoffending
neighbour, it certainly is not law at the present day.

**\[ ... \]**

Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and
unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified
by some well-recognised excuse admitted by the law. It is further
admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing
was justified by what has been called "necessity." But the temptation to
the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called
necessity. Nor is this to be regretted. Though law and morality are not
the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily
illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal
consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder
in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it. It is not
so. To preserve one\'s life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be
the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of
instances in which it is a man\'s duty not to live, but to die. The
duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the
passengers, of soldiers to women and children, as in the noble case of
the Birkenhead; these duties impose on men the moral necessity, not of
the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others from
which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will
men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk. It is not correct,
therefore, to say that there is any absolute or unqualified necessity to
preserve one\'s life. \"Necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam,\" is a saying
of a Roman officer quoted by Lord Bacon himself with high eulogy in the
very chapter on necessity to which so much reference has been made. It
would be a very easy and cheap display of commonplace learning to quote
from Greek and Latin authors, from Horace, from Juvenal, from Cicero,
from Euripides, passage after passage, in which the duty of dying for
others has been laid down in glowing and emphatic language as resulting
from the principles of heathen ethics; it is enough in a Christian
country to remind ourselves of the Great Example whom we profess to
follow. It is not needful to point out the awful danger of admitting the
principle which has been contended for. Who is to be the judge of this
sort of necessity? By what measure is the comparative value of lives to
be measured? Is it to be strength, or intellect, or \'what? It is plain
that the principle leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the
necessity which will justify him in deliberately taking another\'s life
to save his own. In this case the weakest, the youngest, the most
unresisting, was chosen. Was it more necessary to kill him than one of
the grown men? The answer must be \"No\" --

> \"So spake the Fiend, and with necessity
>
> The tyrant\'s plea, excused his devilish deeds.\"

It is not suggested that in this particular case the deeds were
\"devilish,\" but it is quite plain that such a principle once admitted
might be made the legal cloak for unbridled passion and atrocious crime.
There is no safe path for judges to tread but to ascertain the law to
the best of their ability and to declare it according to their judgment;
and if in any case the law appears to be too severe on individuals, to
leave it to the Sovereign to exercise that prerogative of mercy which
the Constitution has intrusted to the hands fittest to dispense it.

It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an
excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how
awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment
straight and the conduct pure. We are often compelled to set up
standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we
could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare
temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it,
nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner
the legal definition of the crime. It is therefore our duty to declare
that the prisoners\' act in this case was wilful murder, that the facts
as stated in the verdict are no legal justification of the homicide; and
to say that in our unanimous opinion the prisoners are upon this special
verdict guilty of
murder.[^\[2\]^](#Xc83751619039f0ed29ec403e32917010da48007)

OPINION

MARTHA CRAIG DAUGHTREY, Circuit Judge.

The defendant, Darwin Veach, appeals from his conviction and sentence
for resisting a federal law enforcement officer and threatening to
assault and murder two federal law enforcement officers with intent to
impede the performance of their official duties. **\[ ... \]**Because we
conclude that the district judge improperly restricted Veach's ability
to present a diminished capacity defense to a specific-intent crime, we
reverse the defendant's convictions for threatening to assault and
murder law enforcement officers with intent to impede the performance of
their official duties and remand this matter for retrial on those
counts. **\[ ... \]**

I. *FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND*

There is no dispute concerning the relevant facts underlying the
defendant's convictions. **\[ ... \]**Veach's automobile was involved in
a collision with another vehicle in Cumberland Gap National Historic
Park. When United States Park Rangers Greg Mullin and Karen Bradford
arrived on the scene, they suspected that the defendant was intoxicated
and performed various field sobriety tests and a portable breath test on
Veach that confirmed their initial impressions.

While securing the defendant for transport, Ranger Mullin was forced to
struggle with Veach, who "attempted to pull away from" Mullin. **\[ ...
\]**as Mullin drove the defendant to the police station for booking,
Veach stated, "I'm going to mess with you; if I get a shot at you\[,\]
God dammit I'll kill you, I will; and I'm going to cut your head off."
Veach was later transported to a local hospital for treatment of a
facial cut, and once there he again threatened to decapitate one of the
rangers. On the way back to the detention center, Veach threatened
Mullin and Bradford once more, saying, "I will put a fuckin' bullet
straight in your fuckin' head. The sheriff won't always be in office and
15 years later I'll walk up on you \.... I'm going to drive you'ans all
straight to hell."

Based on these facts, the jury convicted Veach of one count of resisting
a federal law enforcement officer, 18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1), and two counts
of threatening to assault and murder a federal law enforcement officer
with intent to impede such officer in the performance of official
duties, 18 U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(B). **\[ ... \]**

II\. *DISCUSSION*

**\[ ... \]**

1\. Presentation of a Diminished Capacity Defense

As we have held, "\[i\]t is well established that intoxication, whether
voluntary or involuntary, may preclude the formation of specific-intent
and thus serve to negate an essential element of certain crimes."
*United States v. Newman,* 889 F.2d 88, 92 (6th Cir.1989). It is,
however, only "the mens rea of a specific-intent crime" that may be
negated by a diminished capacity or voluntary intoxication defense**\[
... \]**

Pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1):

> Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or
> interferes with \[any officer or employee of the United States or of
> any agency in any branch of the United States Government, or any
> person assisting such an officer or employee\] while engaged in or on
> account of the performance of official duties \... shall, where the
> acts \... constitute only simple assault, be fined \... or imprisoned
> not more than one year, or both \....

This statutory provision clearly indicates that any violator will be
punished solely for the forcible assault on, resistance to, opposition
to, impedance of, intimidation of, or interference with a designated
individual. No other intent on the part of a defendant need be shown;
the mere intentional performance of the prohibited act is sufficient to
subject the perpetrator to federal criminal liability. The plain
language of the statute thus supports the district judge's conclusion
that voluntary intoxication or diminished functional capacity is not a
viable defense to a charge of a violation of § 111.

**\[ ... \]**

Unlike 18 U.S.C. § 111, however, § 115(a)(1)(B) does contain additional
language not found in the former general intent statute. That latter
statutory provision reads:

> Whoever threatens to assault, kidnap, or murder, a United States
> official, a United States judge, a Federal law enforcement officer, or
> an official whose killing would be a crime under \[18 U.S.C. § 1114\],
> *with intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with such official,
> judge, or law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of
> official duties, or with intent to retaliate against such official,
> judge, or law enforcement officer on account of the performance of
> official duties,* shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).
> (Emphasis added.)

Despite the clear linguistic differences in the two statutes, the
government argues that § 115, like § 111, contains no element of
specific intent. **\[ ... \]**

the additional, specific intent requirement in 18 U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(B)
differentiates that statute from 18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1). Not only does §
115(a)(1)(B) require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant threatened certain action against a government
official but also that the defendant made such a threat for the specific
purpose of interfering with the performance of official duties or of
retaliating for the performance of such duties. Indeed, we have assumed
the requirement of specific intent in numerous opinions, both published
and unpublished, involving § 115 prosecutions. **\[ ... \]**

Both the actual language of the statute itself and our allusions to the
requirements for conviction under that provision lead to the inescapable
conclusion that 18 U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(B) contains a specific intent
element that must be proven by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.
Consequently, because a defendant must possess a particular *mens rea*
in order to be guilty of the crimes described in that statute, in this
case Veach should have been allowed to present evidence to the jury that
he was too intoxicated at the time of his arrest to form the requisite
specific intent. Instead, the district judge specifically forbade the
defendant from "making intoxication \... a defense" or from attempting
to show "that he could not form an opinion."

That ruling was in error and prevented Veach from challenging
effectively the government's assertion that it had proved all essential
elements of a charge under 18 U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(B) beyond a reasonable
doubt. Because the admitted evidence thus does not establish all offense
elements, we must reverse Veach's § 115 convictions and remand this
matter to the district court for retrial on those charges only.

Stephen Morse, Excusing the Crazy: The Insanity Defense Reconsidered

 

Morse, Stephen J., \"Excusing the Crazy: The Insanity Defense
Reconsidered\" (1985). Faculty Scholarship at Penn Law. 1355.
https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/1355, pp780-782.

 

The basic moral issue regarding the insanity defense is whether it is
just to hold responsible and punish a person who was extremely crazy at
the time of the offense.4 Those who believe that the insanity defense
should be abolished must claim either that no defendant is extremely
crazy at the time of the offense or that it is morally proper to convict
and punish such people. Neither claim is easy to justify.

In all societies some people at some times behave crazily---that is, the
behavior at those times is recognizably, aberrantly irrational. A small
number of these people behave extremely crazily on occasion, including
those times when an offense is committed. A hypothetical defendant with
a delusional belief that he is the object of a murderous plot, who kills
one of the alleged plotters after hallucinating that he hears the
plotter\'s foul threats, is crazy. Such cases are rare, but clearly
exist; the influence of extreme craziness on some criminal behavior
cannot be denied.

 For hundreds of years the common law has recognized the unfairness of
holding some crazy persons responsible for their criminal behavior.5 The
legal test for insanity, designed to identify the appropriate persons to
be excused, has changed over the years. Whether the test seeks to excuse
only those akin to wild beasts or also those who lack substantial
capacity to conform their conduct to the requirements of law, the moral
perception has remained constant: at least some crazy persons should be
excused. Those who would abolish the defense must argue that no sound
principles underlie the law\'s consistent retention of the defense. That
most past discussions of the issue have failed clearly to identify such
principles6 is hardly an argument that they do not exist. I maintain
that such sound principles do exist; some persons whose craziness
influences their criminal behavior cannot fairly be held responsible and
thus do not deserve punishment.

To justify the moral necessity of the insanity defense, I must set forth
some assumptions I make about our system of criminal justice. Conviction
and punishment are justified only if the defendant deserves them. The
basic precondition for desert in all contexts, legal and otherwise, is
the actor\'s responsibility as a moral agent. Any condition or
circumstance that sufficiently compromises responsibility must therefore
negate desert; a just criminal law will incorporate such conditions and
circumstances in its doctrines of excuse. A coherent, purely
consequentialist theory of criminal justice, while conceivable, is so
unattractive morally that few persons, including most critics of the
insanity defense, adhere to such a position.7 Moreover, our present
system clearly rests on a much different basis:8 our system of criminal
justice accepts desert, whether viewed as a defining or limiting
principle,9 as fundamental to guilt and punishment.

\...

The insanity defense is rooted in moral principles of excuse that are
accepted in both ordinary human interaction and criminal law. Our
intuition is that minimal rationality (a cognitive capacity) and minimal
self-control or lack of compulsion (a volitional capacity) are the
essential preconditions for responsibility.10 Young children are not
considered responsible for the harms they cause precisely because they
lack these capacities.11 Similarly, adults who cause harm while
terrifically distraught because of a personal tragedy, for instance,
will typically be thought less responsible and culpable for the harm
than if they had been normally rational and in control.12 Aristotle
recognized these fundamental requirements for responsibility by noting
that persons may be less blameworthy for actions committed under the
influence of mistake (a cognitive problem) or compulsion (a so-called
volitional problem).13

Criminal law defenses that focus on the moral attributes of the
defendant are based on these same intuitions and principles. Even if the
defendant\'s conduct fulfills the usual requirements for prima facie
guilt---that is, act, mental state, causation, result---the defendant
will be found not guilty, not culpable, if the acts committed were the
products of cognitive (e.g., infancy) or volitional (e.g., duress)
circumstances that were not under the defendant\'s control. These
defenses are considered relevant at the time of guilt determination as
well as at the time of sentencing. It would be indeed illogical in a
criminal justice system based partly on desert to hold that a defendant
with a valid claim of duress is culpable (because he or she intended to
do the compelled act), but then to decide to release the defendant
because he or she does not deserve punishment. To convict a person with
a meritorious defense would offend our conception of the relationship
between legal guilt and blameworthiness. A person acting under duress is
not culpable, although it is unfortunate that a prohibited act has been
committed.

In sum, the moral basis of the insanity defense is that there is no just
punishment without desert and no desert without responsibility.
Responsibility is, in turn, based on minimal cognitive and volitional
competence. Thus, an actor who lacks such competence is not responsible,
does not deserve punishment, and cannot justly be punished.

This news article highlights the difference between mental illness,
which is a medical term, and insanity, which is a legal term. The
mothers in both situations were diagnosed with postpartum psychosis,
they both killed their children, yet one received an insanity defense

Report to Minnesota Legislature: Mentally Ill Criminals and the Insanity
Defense (excerpt), pp.2-14

 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329453919_MENTALLY_ILL_CRIMINALS_AND_THE_INSANITY_DEFENSE_A_Report_to_the_Minnesota_Legislature

 

 

This report is about how the criminal justice system deals with people
who have a severe mental illness. Mental illness is a conundrum for the
courts. People with schizophrenia, for example, have a profound loss of
ability to think, plan, and make decisions because their brains don\'t
work correctly. Some may have a delusion that their life is in danger
and commit a crime to protect themselves. Others may hear over-powering
voices commanding them to do something wrong. Are such people competent
to stand trial or agree to a plea bargain? Do they meet the legal
standard of intent to commit a crime? Does their illness excuse them or
mitigate the severity ofpunishment? What should happen to them if
convicted, or if not convicted?

Because no clear answers exist to these questions, states have taken
different legal paths with mental illness. Minnesota, for instance, uses
a legal test for judging whether someone is not guilty by reason of
insanity that came from a 19th century British case. Other states,
however, have adopted newer tests for insanity or have added the verdict
\"guilty but mentally ill.\" Some states allow a defendant to claim
mental illness as a mitigating factor; others do not. A few states have
abolished the insanity defense. Usually these changes reflect shifting
public sentiments about whether mentally ill criminals should be
punished or treated for their illness, and about how best to protect the
public from mentally ill criminals.

New discoveries about mental illness might also cause us to re-examine
the treatment of mentally ill people in criminal justice. Until
recently, the biological basis of serious mental illness was virtually
unknown. Now, high-tech brain scans show the exact areas of a sick brain
that are not working properly, and biochemists have discovered some of
the chemical pathways in the brain that malfunction in mental illness.
These discoveries have increased public awareness ofmental illness and
helped reduce the social stigma that is often attached to those who
suffer these illnesses\....

**Severe Mental Illness**

Authorities distinguish severe or serious mental illnesses, which are
physical diseases of the brain, from less serious mental conditions that
are usually psychological but not physical in origin.! Serious mental
illness includes schizophrenia, bipolar (manic- depressive) illness, and
major depression. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks are
often added to the list. Together, these illnesses are more common than
cancer or heart disease and, over a lifetime, affect one in five
families. About 20 percent of the nation\'s hospital beds are taken by
people with a mental illness. Severe brain disorders have both
hereditary and environmental causes that are not yet fully understood.

Serious mental illness does not include mental retardation,
hyperactivity, multiple personality, personality or character disorder,
psychopathic personality, sexual psychopathology, pedophilia, addiction,
or similar conditions, although research points increasingly to the
likelihood that some of these, too, are related to brain disorders.

Serious mental illness disrupts a person\'s ability to think, feel, and
relate to other people and the physical environment. Many people with a
severe mental illness lose their jobs, become estranged from their
families, are homeless, or commit suicide. About 160,000 people with
severe mental illnesses are in the nation\'s jails and prisons.

Schizophrenia is the most chronic and disabling mental illness,
affecting 1 percent of the population. It usually strikes people in
their late teens or early twenties, although victims may have subtle
signs ofbrain dysfunction in childhood. Typical symptoms are
hallucinations, delusions, and bizarre thinking, collectively referred
to as psychosis. People with the illness may believe that their thoughts
are under control of someone else or coming from outside their head.
Poor brain functioning also causes a breakdown of social relationships,
poor communication skills, and lack of motivation. Schizophrenia has
different subtypes; one is paranoid schizophrenia, in which the victim
has intense fears or feelings of persecution accompanying
hallucinations. Although many people with schizophrenia are helped by
drug therapy and social assistance, few recover from the disease.

Bipolar illness and depression affect a person\'s mood more than
thinking ability. In bipolar illness, a person\'s mood cycles between
extreme depression, normal mood, and extreme euphoria or mania. In the
manic stage a person may have grandiose delusions or psychotic thought
processes similar to those of schizophrenia and may abuse illegal drugs
or alcohol. At the other extreme, a person who is extremely depressed
may feel life is hopeless and have difficulty concentrating or making
decisions; suicide is a strong possibility. Mood disorders can usually
be treated successfully with drugs and electroconvulsive therapy, but
the illness may return intermittently.

**Mental Illness and Crime**

Crimes by mentally ill people are sometimes very sensational, which may
give the public the misperception that mentally ill people often commit
violent crimes. Researchers have closely examined the link between
mental illness and violent crime. They have found that most people who
commit violent crimes are not mentally ill and most mentally ill people
do not commit crimes. One study found that about 3 percent of the
variation in violent crime in the United States is related to mental
illness.

In general, mentally ill people are more likely to be victims of violent
crime than perpetrators. But research has pointed to a small group of
people with severe mental illness who are at higher risk for violent
behavior.  People with psychoses - bizarre thinking, hallucinations, and
delusions - as found in schizophrenia and, less often, in mood
disorders, are more likely to commit violent crimes than people with no
mental disorder. This has been reported in many research studies

A connection with violence also applies to people with some neurological
brain diseases, such as Huntington\'s chorea, and to people who have had
head injuries that damaged the brain.

A recent study of mentally ill people looked at their use of medication
and alcohol in relation to violence. Results showed that when mentally
ill people stop taking their medicine and abuse alcohol or illegal
drugs, they are more likely to be violent. Violent behavior is also more
likely among people with paranoia who hear command voices telling them
to kill someone, or who believe their mind is dominated by forces beyond
their control. The victims of mentally ill people are often members of
their own family.

**Frequency of Insanity Pleas and Acquittals**

For centuries the law has encompassed the widely held belief that some
people are too mentally deranged to know what they are doing and,
therefore, cannot be held morally responsible for a crime. This
principle came from English common law, which presumed that an illegal
act was not a crime unless performed with criminal intent. In a criminal
trial, a mentally ill person might be found not guilty by reason of
insanity, despite proof that the person had committed a crime.

Insanity pleas and acquittals are relatively uncommon. An eight-state
study of 581,000 indictments found 8,979 insanity pleas - a rate of 1.5
percent,6 A different study of insanity cases in four states
(California, Georgia, Montana, and New York) showed that of 586,000
felony indictments, only 5,300 (0.9%) had a plea of insanity by the
defendant,? And of the 5,300 insanity pleas, there were 1,385 acquittals
by reason of insanity - 0.23 percent of indictments and 26 percent of
insanity pleas. A study of adult defendants represented by the Public
Defender\'s office in New Jersey found 52 insanity pleas for 32,000
defendants (less than 0.2%) and of the 52 cases, 15 were successful. 

The connection between serious mental illness and successful insanity
pleas is well documented.  The eight-state study of almost 2,600
criminal defendants who were found not guilty by reason of insanity
(NGRl) reported that 68 percent had schizophrenia and 16 percent had a
severe mood disorder - a total of 84 percent with a severe
mental illness.  The others were mentally retarded (5%) had another
illness (5%), a  personality disorder (3.5%), or were chemically
dependent. The crimes they had been charged with were murder (150/0),
physical assault (38%), other violent crimes (12%), robbery (7%),
property crimes (18%), and other minor crimes (10%).

**Mentall Illness in \[ \] Prisons**

\... A report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that
10 percent of inmates in the nation\'s state prisons and 10 percent of
those in local jails currently have a mental illness; another 6 percent
have previously had a mental condition. These data are based on
self-reporting by inmates in a national survey. About 19 percent of
inmates reported that they have taken a prescribed medication for a
\"mental or emotional condition.\" Mental illness was reported more
often by female prisoners than males, and more often by white prisoners
than other races. Alcohol and drug use were more strongly associated
with mentally ill inmates than others, and nearly 6 of 10 mentally ill
inmates reported that they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs
at the time of their current offense. Mentally ill inmates in state
prisons serve longer than average sentences because they are more
frequently involved in fights and have more disciplinary problems than
other inmates.

Legal Dimensions of Mental/Illness and Crime

The large numbers of mentally ill inmates in jails and prisons show that
the legal concept of \"insanity\" is not the same as a medical diagnosis
of mental illness, such as schizophrenia or paranoia. In fact, few
people who are mentally ill meet t4e legal standard of insanity. The
courts use one of several legal tests - not medical tests - to determine
whether people meet the standard of insanity that would excuse them from
guilt for a crime.

 

\[..\]

We first review the most common tests for insanity, then other
dimensions of legal process.

**McNaughtan test**

In 1843 Daniel McNaughtan shot and killed the secretary of the British
Prime Minister by mistake while intending to kill the Prime Minister. At
trial, McNaughtan was found \"not guilty, on the ground of insanity.\"
Public outcry and royal concern about the acquittal led a panel
ofjustices to establish a standard for insanity, which is still used by
British courts. The test was meant to be used by a jury after hearing
medical testimony from prosecution and defense experts. Under this rule
a defendant was presumed sane unless the defense proved that:

\"At the time of committing the act, the party accused was laboring
under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know
the nature and quality of the act he was doing or, ifhe did know it,
that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.\"

About half of American states use the test \[or a modified version, as
in New York\]. Notice, however, that it does not excuse mentally ill
people who knew what they did was wrong but were unable to control their
actions. To allow for this possibility, several states have added an
exculpatory provision for a person who could not contro

 

**American Law Institute test**

In 1972 the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia endorsed a
Model Penal Code standard, which the American Law Institute had proposed
in the 1950s. Under the ALI test,

A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such
conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial
capacity either to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his
conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

The ALI test is less stringent than McNaughtan because it does not
require a total lack of self-control or inability to know right from
wrong, but only that someone with mental illness \"lacks substantial
capacity\" to act and reason normally. The ALI test is used in about 20
states, and it was used in federal courts until 1984, when a more
stringent test was adopted.

**Appreciation test**

In 1984 the appreciation test was made law in all federal courts by act
of Congress.  A few states have adopted similar laws. These changes were
largely a response to public dismay when John Hinckley was found NGRI
after his attempted assassination of President Reagan. Federallaw
requires that a defendant prove by clear and convincing evidence that:

\"At the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense,
the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was
unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his
acts.\"

At the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the
defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable
to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.  
The requirement of \"unable to appreciate\" is tougher than ALI\'s
\"lacks substantial capacity.\"

**No test**

Three states have abolished the insanity defense: Utah, Montana, and
Idaho.  \[Note, more states have abolished the test since then\]. In
these states, however, defendants can offer evidence at trial that they
lacked the mental capacity to form the intent to commit the crime they
are charged with. The prosecution must rebut this claim beyond a
reasonable doubt.

**Civil commitment test**

Sometimes mentally ill persons who commit crimes go through the civil
commitment process instead of being prosecuted. This option might be
pursued by the county attorney after an arrest for a misdemeanor, or a
mentally ill person might be diverted into the medical system without
being arrested or charged for the crime. Mentally ill persons can be
committed to supervision and care by the state in a state hospital when
they are a danger to themselves or others. (Commitment is also possible
for mentally ill persons who are unable to care for themselves.)
Behavior that meets the test of dangerousness for civil commitment
overlaps with behavior that might be prosecuted as a criminal offense.

Several decades ago, the standards for civil commitment were less
stringent than today, and people with a severe mental illness were often
committed to care in a state hospital before they would have met
today\'s test of dangerousness. Now, restrictive commitment laws make it
more likely that people with severe mental illness are caught up in the
criminal justice system. This is a well recognized and often debated
national phenomenon.

M\'Naughten\'s Case

 

**DANIEL M\'NAGHTEN\'S CASE.**

**May 26, June 19, 1843.**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

prisoner had been indicted for that he, on the 20th day of January 1843,
at the parish of Saint Martin in the Fields, in the county of Middlesex,
and within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, in and upon
one Edward Drummond, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice
aforethought, did make an assault; and that the said Daniel M\'Naghten,
a certain pistol of the value of 20s., loaded and \[201\] charged with
gunpowder and a leaden bullet (which pistol he in his right hand had and
held), to, against and upon the said Edward Drummond, feloniously,
wil-fully, and of his malice aforethought, did shoot and discharge; and
that the said Daniel M\'Naghten, with the leaden bullet aforesaid, out
of the pistol aforesaid, by force of the gunpowder, etc., the said
Edward Drummond, in and upon the back of him the said Edward Drummond,
feloniously, etc. did strike, penetrate and wound, giving to the said
Edward Drummond, in and upon the back of the said Edward Drummond, one
mortal wound, etc., of which mortal wound the said E. Drummond
languished until the 25th of April and then died; and that by the means
aforesaid, lie the prisoner did kill and murder the said Edward
Drummond. The prisoner pleaded Not guilty. 

Evidence having been given of the fact of the shooting of Mr .Drummond,
and of his death in consequence thereof, witnesses were called on the
part of the prisoner, to prove that he was not, at the time of
committing the act, in a sound state of mind. The medical evidence was
in substance this: That persons of otherwise sound mind, might be
affected by morbid delusions: that the prisoner was in that condition:
that a person so labouring under a morbid delusion, might have a moral
perception of right and wrong, but that in the case of the prisoner it
was a delusion which carried him away beyond the power of his own
control, and left him no such perception; and that he was not capable of
exercising any control over acts which had connexion with his delusion:
that it was of the nature of the disease with which the prisoner was
affected, to go on gradually until it had reached a climax, when it
burst forth with irresistible \[202\] intensity: that a man might go on
for years quietly, though at the same time under its influence, but
would all at once break out into the most extrava- gant and violent
paroxysms.

**\[ ... \]**

Lord Chief Justice Tindal (in his charge): -The question to be
determined is, whether at the time the act in question was committed,
the prisoner had or had not the use of his understanding, so as to know
that he was doing a wrong or wicked act. If the jurors should be of
opinion that the prisoner was not sensible, at the time he committed it,
that he was violating the laws both of God and man, then he would be
entitled to a verdict in his favour: but if, on the contrary, they were
of opinion that when he committed the act he was in a sound state of
mind, then their verdict must be against him. 

Verdict, Not guilty, on the ground of insanity.

**\[ ... \]**

Your Lordships are pleased to inquire of us, secondly, \"What are the
proper ques- tions to be submitted to the jury, where a person alleged
to be afflicted with insane delusion respecting one or more particular
subjects or persons, is charged with the commission of a crime (murder,
for example), and insanity is set up as a defence?\" And, thirdly, \"In
what terms ought the question to be left to the jury as to the
prisoner\'s state of mind at the time when \[210\] the act was
committed? \" And as these two questions appear to us to be more
conveniently answered together, we have to submit our opinion to be.
that the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be
presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be
respon- sible for his crimes,until the contrary be proved to their
satisfaction ; and that to estab- lish a defence on the ground of
insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing
of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of
reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality
of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not, know he
was doing what was wrong. The mode of putting the latter part of the
question to the jury on these occasions has generally been, whether the
accused at the time of doing the act knew the difference between right
and wrong: which mode, though rarely, if ever, leading to any mistake
with the jury, is not, as we conceive, so accurate when put generally
and in the abstract, as when put with reference to the party\'s
knowledge of right and wrong in respect to the very act with which he is
charged. If the question were to be put as to the knowledge of the
accused solely and exclusively with reference to the law of the land, it
might tend to confound the jury, by inducing them to believe that an
actual knowledge of the law of the land was essential in order to lead
to a convic- tion ; whereas the law is administered upon the principle
that every one must be taken conclusively to know it, without proof that
he does know it. If the accused was con- scious that the act was one
which he ought not to do, and if that act was at the same time contrary
to the law of the land, he is punishable; and the usual course therefore
\[211\] has been to leave the question to the jury, whether the party
accused had a suffi- cient degree of reason to know that he was doing an
act that was wrong: and this course we think is correct, accompanied
with such observations and explanations as the circumstances of each
particular case may require.

**\[ ... \]**

Justice Souter

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The case presents two questions: whether due process prohibits Arizona's
use of an insanity test stated solely in terms of the capacity to tell
whether an act charged as a crime was right or wrong; and whether
Arizona violates due process in restricting consideration of defense
evidence of mental illness and incapacity to its bearing on a claim of
insanity, thus eliminating its significance directly on the issue of the
mental element of the crime charged (known in legal shorthand as the
*mens rea,* or guilty mind). We hold that there is no violation of due
process in either instance.

I

In the early hours of June 21, 2000, Officer Jeffrey Moritz of the
Flagstaff Police responded in uniform to complaints that a pickup truck
with loud music blaring was circling a residential block. When he
located the truck, the officer turned on the emergency lights and siren
of his marked patrol car, which prompted petitioner Eric Clark, the
truck's driver (then 17), to pull over. Officer Moritz got out of the
patrol car and told Clark to stay where he was. Less than a minute
later, Clark shot the officer, who died soon after but not before
calling the police dispatcher for help. Clark ran away on foot but was
arrested later that day with gunpowder residue on his hands; the gun
that killed the officer was found nearby, stuffed into a knit cap.

Clark was charged with first-degree murder under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §
13-1105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005) for intentionally or knowingly killing a
law enforcement officer in the line of duty.[^205] In March 2001, Clark
was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a state
hospital for treatment, but two years later the same trial court found
his competence restored and ordered him to be tried. Clark waived his
right to a jury, and the case was heard by the court.

At trial, Clark did not contest the shooting and death, but relied on
his undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident in
denying that he had the specific intent to shoot a law enforcement
officer or knowledge that he was doing so, as required by the statute.
Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark
knew Officer Moritz was a law enforcement officer. The evidence showed
that the officer was in uniform at the time, that he caught up with
Clark in a marked police car with emergency lights and siren going, and
that Clark acknowledged the symbols of police authority and stopped. The
testimony for the prosecution indicated that Clark had intentionally
lured an officer to the scene to kill him, having told some people a few
weeks before the incident that he wanted to shoot police officers. At
the close of the State's evidence, the trial court denied Clark's motion
for judgment of acquittal for failure to prove intent to kill a law
enforcement officer or knowledge that Officer Moritz was a law
enforcement officer.

In presenting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he
sought to introduce for two purposes. First, he raised the affirmative
defense of insanity, putting the burden on himself to prove by clear and
convincing evidence, § 13-502(C) (West 2001), that "at the time of the
commission of the criminal act \[he\] was afflicted with a mental
disease or defect of such severity that \[he\] did not know the criminal
act was wrong," §13-502(A).[^206] Second, he aimed to rebut the
prosecution's evidence of the requisite *mens rea,* that he had acted
intentionally or knowingly to kill a law enforcement officer. See, *e.
g.,* Record in No. CR 2000-538 (Ariz. Super. Ct.), Doc. 374 (hereinafter
Record).

The trial court ruled that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing on
insanity to dispute the *mens rea.* The court cited *State* v. *Mott,*
187 Ariz. 536, 931 P. 2d 1046, cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1234 (1997),
which "refused to allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific
intent," 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, and held that "Arizona
does not allow evidence of a defendant's mental disorder short of
insanity \... to negate the *mens rea* element of a crime," *ibid*[**\[
... \]**](#Xeae156c4539ab6bfee3ecded7dc657a994cc287)

As to his insanity, then, Clark presented testimony from classmates,
school officials, and his family describing his increasingly bizarre
behavior over the year before the shooting. Witnesses testified, for
example, that paranoid delusions led Clark to rig a fishing line with
beads and wind chimes at home to alert him to intrusion by invaders, and
to keep a bird in his automobile to warn of airborne poison. There was
lay and expert testimony that Clark thought Flagstaff was populated with
"aliens" (some impersonating government agents), the "aliens" were
trying to kill him, and bullets were the only way to stop them. A
psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid
schizophrenia with delusions about "aliens" when he killed Officer
Moritz, and he concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the officer
or understanding right from wrong and that he was thus insane at the
time of the killing. In rebuttal, a psychiatrist for the State gave his
opinion that Clark's paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from
appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct, as shown by his actions
before and after the shooting (such as circling the residential block
with music blaring as if to lure the police to intervene, evading the
police after the shooting, and hiding the gun).

At the close of the defense case consisting of this evidence bearing on
mental illness, the trial court denied Clark's renewed motion for a
directed verdict grounded on failure of the prosecution to show that
Clark knew the victim was a police officer.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xaa99cc76d181c1bb75799f85ca01c2a8ab6caa4)The judge then issued a
special verdict of first-degree murder, expressly finding that Clark
shot and caused the death of Officer Moritz beyond a reasonable doubt
and that Clark had not shown that he was insane at the time. The judge
noted that though Clark was indisputably afflicted with paranoid
schizophrenia at the time of the shooting, the mental illness "did not .
. . distort his perception of reality so severely that he did not know
his actions were wrong." App. 334. For this conclusion, the judge
expressly relied on "the facts of the crime, the evaluations of the
experts, \[Clark's\] actions and behavior both before and after the
shooting, and the observations of those that knew \[Clark\]." *Id.,* at
333. The sentence was life imprisonment without the possibility of
release for 25 years.

Clark moved to vacate the judgment and sentence, arguing, among other
things, that Arizona's insanity test and its *Mott* rule each violate
due process. As to the insanity standard, Clark claimed (as he had
argued earlier) that the Arizona Legislature had impermissibly narrowed
its standard in 1993 when it eliminated the first part of the two-part
insanity test announced in *M'Naghten's Case,* 10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng.
Rep. 718 (1843). The court denied the motion.

The Court of Appeals of Arizona affirmed Clark's conviction, treating
the conclusion on sanity as supported by enough evidence to withstand
review for abuse of discretion, and holding the State's insanity scheme
consistent with due process. App. 336. As to the latter, the Court of
Appeals reasoned that there is no constitutional requirement to
recognize an insanity defense at all, the bounds of which are left to
the State's discretion. Beyond that, the appellate court followed
*Mott,* reading it as barring the trial court's consideration of
evidence of Clark's mental illness and capacity directly on the element
of *mens rea.* The Supreme Court of Arizona denied further review.

We granted certiorari to decide whether due process prohibits Arizona
from thus narrowing its insanity test or from excluding evidence of
mental illness and incapacity due to mental illness to rebut evidence of
the requisite criminal intent. 546 U. S. 1060 (2005). We now affirm.

II

Clark first says that Arizona's definition of insanity, being only a
fragment of the Victorian standard from which it derives, violates due
process. The landmark English rule in *M'Naghten's Case, supra,* states
that

> "the jurors ought to be told . . . that to establish a defence on the
> ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the
> committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a
> defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature
> and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he
> did not know he was doing what was wrong." *Id.,* at 210, 8 Eng. Rep.,
> at 722.

The first part asks about cognitive capacity: whether a mental defect
leaves a defendant unable to understand what he is doing. The second
part presents an ostensibly alternative basis for recognizing a defense
of insanity understood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental
disease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand that his
action is wrong.

When the Arizona Legislature first codified an insanity rule, it adopted
the full *M'Naghten* statement **\[ ... \]**

In 1993, the legislature dropped the cognitive incapacity part, leaving
only moral incapacity as the nub of the stated definition. See 1993
Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 256, §§ 2---3.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd75c69e60ef0da820d54a642a51bb4ebb51fe84) Under current Arizona
law, a defendant will not be adjudged insane unless he demonstrates that
"at the time of the commission of the criminal act \[he\] was afflicted
with a mental disease or defect of such severity that \[he\] did not
know the criminal act was wrong," Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-502(A)
(West 2001).

**\[ ... \]**

The Court of Appeals of Arizona acknowledged as much in this case, too,
see App. 350 ("It is difficult to imagine that a defendant who did not
appreciate the 'nature and quality' of the act he committed would
reasonably be able to perceive that the act was 'wrong' "), and thus
aligned itself with the long-accepted understanding that the cognitively
incapacitated are a subset of the morally incapacitated within the
meaning of the standard *M'Naghten* rule, see, *e. g.,* Goldstein,
*supra,* at 51 ("In those situations where the accused does not know the
nature and quality of his act, in the broad sense, he will not know that
it was wrong, no matter what construction 'wrong' is given"); 1 W.
LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 7.2(b)(3), p. 536 (2d ed. 2003)
("Many courts feel that knowledge of 'the nature and quality of the act'
is the mere equivalent of the ability to know that the act was wrong"
(citing cases)); *id.,* § 7.2(b)(4), at 537 ("If the defendant does not
know the nature and quality of his act, then quite obviously he does not
know that his act is 'wrong,' and this is true without regard to the
interpretation given to the word 'wrong'"); cf. 1 R. Gerber, Criminal
Law of Arizona 502-7, n. 1 (2d ed. 1993).[**\[ ...
\]**](#X2cdb0fa00cc3f3c16c0770e5e0bb962fe513a57)

Clark, indeed, adopted this very analysis himself in the trial court:
"\[I\]f \[Clark\] did not know he was shooting at a police officer, or
believed he had to shoot or be shot, even though his belief was not
based in reality, this would establish that he did not know what he was
doing was wrong." Record, Doc. 374, at 1. **\[ ... \]**

Ill

Clark's second claim of a due process violation challenges the rule
adopted by the Supreme Court of Arizona in *State* v. *Mott,* **\[ ...
\]**. This case ruled on the admissibility of testimony from a
psychologist offered to show that the defendant suffered from battered
women's syndrome and therefore lacked the capacity to form the *mens
rea* of the crime charged against her. The opinion variously referred to
the testimony in issue as "psychological testimony," 187 Ariz., at 541,
931 P. 2d, at 1051, and "expert testimony," *ibid.,* and implicitly
equated it with "expert psychiatric evidence," *id.,* at 540, 931 P. 2d,
at 1050 (internal quotation marks omitted), and "psychiatric testimony,"
*id.,* at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X888073dafbed4d913d02a646e50fd643877f83d) The state court held
that testimony of a professional psychologist or psychiatrist about a
defendant's mental incapacity owing to mental disease or defect was
admissible, and could be considered, only for its bearing on an insanity
defense; such evidence could not be considered on the element of *mens
rea,* that is, what the State must show about a defendant's mental state
(such as intent or understanding) when he performed the act charged
against him. See *id.,* at 541, 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, 1054.[**\[ ...

Clark's argument that the *Mott* rule violates the Fourteenth Amendment
guarantee of due process turns on the application of the presumption of
innocence in criminal cases, the presumption of sanity, and the
principle that a criminal defendant is entitled to present relevant and
favorable evidence on an element of the offense charged against him.

1

The first presumption is that a defendant is innocent unless and until
the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the
offense charged, see *Patterson,* 432 U. S., at 210-211; *In re
Winship,* 397 U. S. 358, 361-364 (1970), including the mental element or
*mens rea.* Before the last century, the *mens rea* required to be
proven for particular offenses was often described in general terms like
"malice," **\[ ... \]** but the modern tendency has been toward more
specific descriptions, as shown in the Arizona statute defining the
murder charged against Clark: the State had to prove that in acting to
kill the victim, Clark intended to kill a law enforcement officer on
duty or knew that the victim was such an officer on duty. **\[ ...
\]**As applied to *mens rea* (and every other element), the force of the
presumption of innocence is measured by the force of the showing needed
to overcome it, which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a
defendant's state of mind was in fact what the charge states. See
*Winship, supra,* at 361-363.

2

The presumption of sanity is equally universal in some variety or other,
being (at least) a presumption that a defendant has the capacity to form
the *mens rea* necessary for a verdict of guilt and the consequent
criminal responsibility. **\[ ... \]**This presumption dispenses with a
requirement on the government's part to include as an element of every
criminal charge an allegation that the defendant had such a capacity.
The force of this presumption, like the presumption of innocence, is
measured by the quantum of evidence necessary to overcome it; unlike the
presumption of innocence, however, the force of the presumption of
sanity varies across the many state and federal jurisdictions, and prior
law has recognized considerable leeway on the part of the legislative
branch in defining the presumption's strength through the kind of
evidence and degree of persuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see
*Fisher* v. *United States,* 328 U. S. 463, 466-476 (1946).[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd9fa78062b9754669339e644491a72ce8ccd5a0)

There are two points where the sanity or capacity presumption may be
placed in issue. First, a State may allow a defendant to introduce (and
a factfinder to consider) evidence of mental disease or incapacity for
the bearing it can have on the government's burden to show *mens rea.*
See, *e. g., State* v. *Perez,* 882 A. 2d 574, 584 (R. I. 2005).[**\[
... \]**](#X2732e745dcdc2f7095c0fc740a1ab73d6376fc7)If it is shown that
a defendant with mental disease thinks all blond people are robots, he
could not have intended to kill a person when he shot a man with blond
hair, even though he seemed to act like a man shooting another man.[**\[
... \]**](#Xe46943a398bc3ef7092740f40e2896bb0d40cbf)In jurisdictions
that allow mental-disease and capacity evidence to be considered on par
with any other relevant evidence when deciding whether the prosecution
has proven *mens rea* beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence of mental
disease or incapacity need only support what the factfinder regards as a
reasonable doubt about the capacity to form (or the actual formation of)
the *mens rea,* in order to require acquittal of the charge. **\[ ...
\]**

The second point where the force of the presumption of sanity may be
tested is in the consideration of a defense of insanity raised by a
defendant. Insanity rules like *M'Naghten* and the variants discussed in
Part II, *supra,* are attempts to define, or at least to indicate, the
kinds of mental differences that overcome the presumption of sanity or
capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from customary criminal
responsibility, **\[ ... \]**even if the prosecution has otherwise
overcome the presumption of innocence by convincing the factfinder of
all the elements charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden that must
be carried by a defendant who raises the insanity issue, again, defines
the strength of the sanity presumption. A State may provide, for
example, that whenever the defendant raises a claim of insanity by some
quantum of credible evidence, the presumption disappears and the
government must prove sanity to a specified degree of certainty (whether
beyond reasonable doubt or something less). See, *e.g., Commonwealth* v.
*Keita,* 429 Mass. 843, 846, 712 N. E. 2d 65, 68 (1999). Or a
jurisdiction may place the burden of persuasion on a defendant to prove
insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a preponderance of
the evidence or to some more convincing degree, see Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. § 13-502(C) (West 2001); *Leland,* 343 U. S., at 798. In any case,
the defendant's burden defines the presumption of sanity, whether that
burden be to burst a bubble or to show something more.

3

The third principle implicated by Clark's argument is a defendant's
right as a matter of simple due process to present evidence favorable to
himself on an element that must be proven to convict him**\[ ... \]**
**\[ ... \]**

As Clark recognizes, however, the right to introduce relevant evidence
can be curtailed if there is a good reason for doing that. **\[ ...
\]**And if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration may be
subject to limitation, which Arizona claims the power to impose here.
State law says that evidence of mental disease and incapacity may be
introduced and considered, and if sufficiently forceful to satisfy the
defendant's burden of proof under the insanity rule it will displace the
presumption of sanity and excuse from criminal responsibility. But
mental-disease and capacity evidence may be considered only for its
bearing on the insanity defense, and it will avail a defendant only if
it is persuasive enough to satisfy the defendant's burden as defined by
the terms of that defense. The mental-disease and capacity evidence is
thus being channeled or restricted to one issue and given effect only if
the defendant carries the burden to convince the factfinder of insanity;
the evidence is not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether
reasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted are good enough
to satisfy the standard of fundamental fairness that due process
requires. We think they are.

**\[ ... \]**

Are there, then, characteristics of mental-disease and capacity evidence
giving rise to risks that may reasonably be hedged by channeling the
consideration of such evidence to the insanity issue on which, in States
like Arizona, a defendant has the burden of persuasion? We think there
are: in the controversial character of some categories of mental
disease, in the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead, and in
the danger of according greater certainty to capacity evidence than
experts claim for it.

To begin with, the diagnosis may mask vigorous debate within the
profession about the very contours of the mental disease itself. **\[
... \]** Though we certainly do not "condem\[n mental-disease evidence\]
wholesale," Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as *Amici
Curiae* 15, the consequence of this professional ferment is a general
caution in treating psychological classifications as predicates for
excusing otherwise criminal conduct.

Next, there is the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead
jurors (when they are the factfinders) through the power of this kind of
evidence to suggest that a defendant suffering from a recognized mental
disease lacks cognitive, moral, volitional, or other capacity, when that
may not be a sound conclusion at all. Even when a category of mental
disease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defendant's behavior
to that category is uneontroversial, the classification may suggest
something very significant about a defendant's capacity, when in fact
the classification tells us little or nothing about the ability of the
defendant to form *mens rea* or to exercise the cognitive, moral, or
volitional capacities that define legal sanity.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X31eb71bf2f3b5d7a5bcf866f97fc5d72e388268) **\[ ... \]**The limits
of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are evident in the
dispute between the two testifying experts in this case; they agree that
Clark was schizophrenic, but they come to opposite conclusions on
whether the mental disease in his particular case left him bereft of
cognitive or moral capacity. Evidence of mental disease, then, can
easily mislead;**\[ ... \]**And of course, in the cases mentioned
before, in which the categorization is doubtful or the category of
mental disease is itself subject to controversy, the risks are even
greater that opinions about mental disease may confuse a jury into
thinking the opinions show more than they do. Because allowing
mental-disease evidence on *mens rea* can thus easily mislead, it is not
unreasonable to address that tendency by confining consideration of this
kind of evidence to insanity, on which a defendant may be assigned the
burden of persuasion.

There are, finally, particular risks inherent in the opinions of the
experts **\[ ... \]** on whether the mental disease rendered a
particular defendant incapable of the cognition necessary for moral
judgment or *mens rea* or otherwise incapable of understanding the
wrongfulness of the conduct charged. **\[ ... \]**Although such capacity
judgments may be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially
tenuous character is indicated by the candor of the defense expert in
this very case. Contrary to the State's expert, he testified that Clark
lacked the capacity to appreciate the circumstances realistically and to
understand the wrongfulness of what he was doing, App. 48-49, but he
said that "no one knows exactly what was on \[his\] mind" at the time of
the shooting, *id.,* at 48. **\[ ... \]**When . . . 'ultimate issue'
questions are formulated by the law and put to the expert witness who
must then say 'yea' or 'nay,' then the expert witness is required to
make a leap in logic. He no longer addresses himself to medical concepts
but instead must infer or intuit what is in fact unspeakable, namely,
the *probable relationship* between medical concepts and legal or moral
constructs such as free will. **\[ ... \]**In sum, these empirical and
conceptual problems add up to a real risk that an expert's judgment in
giving capacity evidence will come with an apparent authority that
psychologists and psychiatrists do not claim to have. We think that this
risk, like the difficulty in assessing the significance of
mental-disease evidence, supports the State's decision to channel such
expert testimony to consideration on the insanity defense, on which the
party seeking the benefit of this evidence has the burden of persuasion.

**\[ ... \]**

Arizona's rule serves to preserve the State's chosen standard for
recognizing insanity as a defense and to avoid confusion and
misunderstanding on the part of jurors. For these reasons, there is no
violation of due process under *Chambers* and its progeny, and no cause
to claim that channeling evidence on mental disease and capacity offends
any "'principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of
our people as to be ranked as fundamental,' " *Patterson,* 432 U. S., at
202 (quoting *Speiser,* 357 U. S., at 523).

\* \* *\**

The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Arizona is, accordingly,
affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

**^1^** Section 13-1105(A)(3) provides that "\[a\] person commits first
degree murder if. .. \[intending or knowing that the person's conduct
will cause death to a law enforcement officer, the person causes the
death of a law enforcement officer who is in the line of duty."

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join,
dissenting.

In my submission the Court is incorrect in holding that Arizona may
convict petitioner Eric Clark of first-degree murder for the intentional
or knowing killing of a police officer when Clark was not permitted to
introduce critical and reliable evidence showing he did not have that
intent or knowledge. **\[ ... \]**

The Court classifies Clark's behavior and expressed beliefs as
observation evidence but insists that its description by experts must be
mental-disease evidence or capacity evidence. See *ante,* at 757-759.
These categories break down quickly when it is understood how the
testimony would apply to the question of intent and knowledge at issue
here. The most common type of schizophrenia, and the one Clark suffered
from, is paranoid schizophrenia. See P. Berner et al., Diagnostic
Criteria for Functional Psychoses 37 (2d ed. 1992). The existence of
this functional psychosis is beyond dispute, but that does not mean the
lay witness understands it or that a disputed issue of fact concerning
its effect in a particular instance is not something for the expert to
address. Common symptoms of the condition are delusions accompanied by
hallucinations, often of the auditory type, which can cause disturbances
of perception. *Ibid.* Clark's expert testified that people with
schizophrenia often play radios loudly to drown out the voices in their
heads. See App. 32. Clark's attorney argued to the trial court that
this, rather than a desire to lure a policeman to the scene, explained
Clark's behavior just before the killing. *Id.,* at 294-295. The
observation that schizophrenics play radios loudly is a fact regarding
behavior, but it is only a relevant fact if Clark has schizophrenia.

Even if this evidence were, to use the Court's term, mental-disease
evidence, because it relies on an expert opinion, what would happen if
the expert simply were to testify, without mentioning schizophrenia,
that people with Clark's symptoms often play the radio loudly? This
seems to be factual evidence, as the term is defined by the Court, yet
it differs from mental-disease evidence only in forcing the witness to
pretend that no one has yet come up with a way to classify the set of
symptoms being described. More generally, the opinion that Clark had
paranoid schizophrenia---an opinion shared by experts for both the
prosecution and defense---bears on efforts to determine, as a factual
matter, whether he knew he was killing a police officer. The
psychiatrist's explanation of Clark's condition was essential to
understanding how he processes sensory data and therefore to deciding
what information was in his mind at the time of the shooting. Simply
put, knowledge relies on cognition, and cognition can be affected by
schizophrenia. **\[ ... \]**The mental-disease evidence at trial was
also intertwined with the observation evidence because it lent needed
credibility. Clark's parents and friends testified Clark thought the
people in his town were aliens trying to kill him. These claims might
not be believable without a psychiatrist confirming the story based on
his experience with people who have exhibited similar behaviors. It
makes little sense to divorce the observation evidence from the
explanation that makes it comprehensible.

**\[ ... \]**

The evidence at trial addressed more than the question of general
incapacity or opinions regarding mental illness; it went further, as it
included so-called observation evidence relevant to Clark's mental state
at the moment he shot the officer. There was testimony, for example,
that Clark thought the people in his town, particularly government
officials, were not human beings but aliens who were trying to kill him.
**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

The razor-thin distinction the Court draws between evidence being used
to show incapacity and evidence being used to show lack of *mens rea*
directly does not identify two different claims. Clark's single claim,
however characterized, involves the use of the same mental-illness
evidence to decide whether he had the requisite knowledge or intent. The
various ways in which the evidence is relevant in disproving *mens rea*
hardly qualify as separate claims. **\[ ... \]**

Before this Court Clark framed the issue in broad terms that encompass
the question whether the evidence of his mental illness should have been
considered to show he did not at the time of the offense have the
knowledge or intent to shoot a police officer.**\[ ... \]** An entire
section of Clark's opening brief argues that the evidence of mental
illness should have been considered to rebut the prosecution's inference
of knowledge or intent from the factual circumstances of the crime. See
Brief for Petitioner 13-21. This line of argument concerns facts of
behavior and amounts to more than a claim of general incapacity.

Clark seeks resolution of issues that can be complex and somewhat
overlapping. In the end, however, we must decide whether he had the
right to introduce evidence showing he lacked the intent or knowledge
the statute itself sets forth in describing a basic element of the
crime. Clark has preserved this issue at all stages, including in this
Court.

**\[ ... \]**

The central theory of Clark's defense was that his schizophrenia made
him delusional. He lived in a universe where the delusions were so
dominant, the theory was, that he had no intent to shoot a police
officer or knowledge he was doing so. It is one thing to say he acted
with intent or knowledge to pull the trigger. It is quite another to say
he pulled the trigger to kill someone he knew to be a human being and a
police officer. If the trier of fact were to find Clark's evidence
sufficient to discount the case made by the State, which has the burden
to prove knowledge or intent as an element of the offense, Clark would
not be guilty of first-degree murder under Arizona law.

**\[ ... \]**The *mens rea* element of intent or knowledge may, at some
level, comprise certain moral choices, but it rests in the first
instance on a factual determination. That is the fact Clark sought to
put in issue. Either Clark knew he was killing a police officer or he
did not.

The issue is not, as the Court insists, whether Clark's mental illness
acts as an "excuse from customary criminal responsibility," *ante,* at
771, but whether his mental illness, as a factual matter, made him
unaware that he was shooting a police officer. If it did, Clark needs no
excuse, as then he did not commit the crime as Arizona defines it. For
the elements of first-degree murder, where the question is knowledge of
particular facts---that one is killing a police officer--- the
determination depends not on moral responsibility but on empirical fact.
Clark's evidence of mental illness had a direct and substantial bearing
upon what he knew, or thought he knew, to be the facts when he pulled
the trigger; this lay at the heart of the matter.

**\[ ... \]**

This is not to suggest all general rules on the exclusion of certain
types of evidence are invalid. If the rule does not substantially burden
the defense, then it is likely permissible. **\[ ... \]**Where, however,
the burden is substantial, the State must present a valid reason for its
*per se* evidentiary rule.

In the instant case Arizona's proposed reasons are insufficient to
support its categorical exclusion. While the State contends that
testimony regarding mental illness may be too incredible or speculative
for the jury to consider, this does not explain why the exclusion
applies in all cases to all evidence of mental illness. **\[ ... \]**

The risk of jury confusion also fails to justify the rule. The State
defends its rule as a means to avoid the complexities of determining how
and to what degree a mental illness affects a person's mental state. The
difficulty of resolving a factual issue, though, does not present a
sufficient reason to take evidence away from the jury even when it is
crucial for the defense. **\[ ... \]**Even were the risk of jury
confusion real enough to justify excluding evidence in most cases, this
would provide little basis for prohibiting all evidence of mental
illness without any inquiry into its likely effect on the jury or its
role in deciding the linchpin issue of knowledge and intent. **\[ ...
\]**

The Court undertakes little analysis of the interests particular to this
case. By proceeding in this way it devalues Clark's constitutional
rights. The reliability rationale has minimal applicability here. The
Court is correct that many mental diseases are difficult to define and
the subject of great debate. See *ante,* at 774-775. Schizophrenia,
however, is a well-documented mental illness, and no one seriously
disputes either its definition or its most prominent clinical
manifestations. The State's own expert conceded that Clark had paranoid
schizophrenia and was actively psychotic at the time of the killing. See
App. 254-257. The jury-confusion rationale, if it is at all applicable
here, is the result of the Court's own insistence on conflating the
insanity defense and the question of intent. Considered on its own
terms, the issue of intent and knowledge is a straightforward factual
question. A trier of fact is quite capable of weighing defense testimony
and then determining whether the accused did or did not intend to kill
or knowingly kill a human being who was a police officer. True, the
issue can be difficult to decide in particular instances, but no more so
than many matters juries must confront.

**\[ ... \]**

Contrary to the Court's suggestion, see *ante,* at 776, the fact that
the state and defense experts drew different conclusions about the
effect of Clark's mental illness on his mental state only made Clark's
evidence contested; it did not make the evidence irrelevant or
misleading. The trial court was capable of evaluating the competing
conclusions, as factfinders do in countless cases where there is a
dispute among witnesses. In fact, the potential to mislead will be far
greater under the Court's new evidentiary system, where jurors will
receive observation evidence without the necessary explanation from
experts.

These are the reasons for my respectful dissent.

PALMER, J.

This appeal requires us to define the term "wrongfulness" for purposes
of the affirmative defense of insanity under General Statutes § 53a-13
(a).[^207] A jury convicted the defendant, Andrew Wilson, of murder in
violation of General Statutes § 53a-54a.[^208] On appeal,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X1f295a45b7ac9a1d18489c023d598d2c5a0357a)the defendant claims
that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the
insanity defense. We agree and, consequently, we reverse the judgment of
conviction.[**\[ ... \]**](#Xf6190e26d02850159b18bff60967e2b15ea66c5)

The following facts are undisputed. The defendant and the victim, Jack
Peters, were acquainted through the victim's son, Dirk Peters, with whom
the defendant had attended high school. In early 1993, the defendant
began to exhibit symptoms of a mental disorder manifested by a
delusional belief that Dirk, assisted by the victim, systematically was
destroying the defendant's life.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X14986f3d3eddd69b3014158c875ceb119866bdb)Specifically, the
defendant believed that, in 1981, Dirk had poisoned him with
methamphetamine and had hypnotized him in order to obtain control of his
thoughts. The defendant believed that Dirk had been acting with the
approval of the victim, who, the defendant also believed, was the
mastermind of a large organization bent on controlling the minds of
others. The defendant further believed that Dirk and the victim were
responsible for the defendant's loss of employment, sexual inadequacy,
physical weakness and other incapacities, as well as the deaths of the
defendant's mother and several family dogs. In addition, the defendant
blamed the victim and Dirk for the breakup of the defendant's
relationship with a former girlfriend.

Beginning in approximately February, 1993, the defendant began
contacting law enforcement authorities to inform them of the conspiracy
by the victim and Dirk to destroy his fife and the lives of others. He
informed the police that Dirk was continuing to drug and brainwash
people, and that Dirk should be stopped. He blamed the victim and Dirk
for his own drug involvement and claimed that they were ruining other
people's lives as well. In May and June, 1993, the defendant repeatedly
called the police, requesting their assistance in combatting the mind
control conspiracy by the victim and Dirk. The police informed him that
it was impossible to investigate his allegations.

On August 5, 1993, the defendant went to see the victim at his home in
the city of Greenwich. He quarreled with the victim and then shot him
numerous times with a semiautomatic handgun that he had purchased two
days earlier from a gun dealer in the city of New Haven.

Later that day, the defendant entered the Greenwich police headquarters
and stated that he had shot the victim because he "had to do it." The
defendant thereafter gave a sworn statement to the police in which he
indicated, among other things, that: (1) his life had been ruined by
Dirk, who had drugged, hypnotized and brainwashed him; (2) the victim
had assisted Dirk in these activities; (3) Dirk and the victim were
responsible for the defendant's schizophrenia; (4) the conduct of Dirk
and the victim required "drastic action" and "drastic retribution"; and
(5) the defendant had shot the victim repeatedly at the victim's home
earlier that day.

At trial, the defendant raised his mental illness as an affirmative
defense under § 53a-13. The jury, however, rejected the defendant's
claim of insanity and convicted him of murder. The trial court rendered
judgment sentencing the defendant to sixty years imprisonment. This
appeal followed.[**\[ ...
\]**](#X16acdd62e7170422be55cb23842ffb071392384)

The primary issue raised by this appeal is whether the trial court
improperly failed to give an instruction defining the term
"wrongfulness" under § 53a-13 (a). Section 53a-13 (a) provides that
"\[i\]n any prosecution for an offense, it shall be an affirmative
defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act
or acts, lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or
defect, either to appreciate the *wrongfulness* of his conduct or to
control his conduct within the requirements of the law." (Emphasis
added.) In this case, the defendant requested that the trial court
instruct the jury that wrongfulness is comprised of a moral element, so
that "an accused is not criminally responsible for his offending act if,
because of mental disease or defect, he believes that he is morally
justified in his conduct --- even though he may appreciate that his act
is criminal."[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xf0de935a525f14e1126bf4f7f4ea3857ab93c5c)The trial court,
however, refused to instruct the jury that the defendant was entitled to
prevail under § 53a-13 (a) if the evidence established that the
defendant believed his conduct to be morally justified. The defendant
argues that the court's failure to charge the juiy on this moral
component of the insanity defense requires reversal. The state, on the
other hand, contends that the defendant was not entitled to such an
instruction but that, even if he were, the trial court's failure to give
this instruction did not constitute harmful error.

Our resolution of the defendant's claim requires us to answer three
subordinate questions: (1) How should a trial court define the term
"wrongfulness" as it is used in § 53a-13 (a) when a definitional
instruction of that term is requested?[**\[ ...
\]**](#X3e5461d358926a95ce5ed4c3eb7f4cb6415d5fa) **\[ ... \]**We
conclude that the defendant was entitled to receive an instruction
properly defining the term "wrongfulness" **\[ ... \]** Accordingly, we
reverse the judgment of the trial court.

I

In determining the appropriate definition of the term "wrongfulness"
under § 53a-13 (a), we are guided by familiar principles of statutory
construction. "Our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect
to the apparent intent of the legislature. \... In seeking to discern
that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the
legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the
legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship
to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same
general subject matter." **\[ ... \]**In ascertaining the meaning of the
language of § 53a-13 as it applies to this case, therefore, we look, in
the first instance, to the relevant legislative history for guidance.
That legislative history includes the genealogy of the insanity defense
in this state, the history of the Model Penal Code provision upon which
§ 53a-13 is based and the legislative debate surrounding the enactment
of § 53a-13.

**\[ ... \]** In 1967**\[ ... \]**the General Assembly adopted the
American Law Institute's Model Penal Code test for insanity, now
codified at § 53a-13,[**\[ ...
\]**](#X8705800e1c0cdc19ce1772379b452c475d81d30) as a statutory standard
**\[ ... \]**The Model Penal Code test provides, in language nearly
identical to that now contained in § 53a-13 (a), that "\[a\] person is
not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a
result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either
to appreciate the criminality \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to
conform his conduct to the requirements of law." (Brackets in original.)
**\[ ... \]**

For purposes of this appeal, three features of the Model Penal Code test
are noteworthy. First, **\[ ... \]**this test encompasses,**\[ ... \]**
both a cognitive and a volitional prong. Under the cognitive prong, a
person is considered legally insane if, as a result of mental disease or
defect, "he lacks substantial capacity \... to appreciate the
criminality \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct." Id. Under the volitional
prong, a person also would be considered legally insane if "he lacks
substantial capacity \... to conform his conduct to the requirements of
law." Id. **\[ ... \]**

Second, the Model Penal Code test focuses on the defendant's actual
*appreciation of,* rather than merely his *knowledge of,* the
wrongfulness of his conduct. Cf. General Statutes § 53a-13 (a)
(defendant must lack "substantial capacity, as a result of mental
disease or defect \... to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct").
The drafters of the Model Penal Code purposefully adopted the term
"appreciate" in order to account for the defendant whose "detached or
abstract awareness" of the wrongfulness of his conduct "does not
penetrate to the affective level." **\[ ... \]**As Herbert Wechsler,
chief reporter for the Model Penal Code, stated in his model jury
charge: "To appreciate the wrongfulness of conduct is, in short, to
realize that it is wrong; to understand the idea as a matter of
importance and reality; to grasp it in a way that makes it meaningful in
the life of the individual, not as a bare abstraction put in words."
Id., § 4.01, appendix C, p. 215.

The third important feature of the Model Penal Code test, and the most
relevant for purposes of this appeal, is its alternative phrasing of the
cognitive prong. By bracketing the term "wrongfulness" and juxtaposing
that term with "criminality," the drafters purposefully left it to the
individual state legislatures to decide which of these two standards to
adopt to describe the nature of the conduct that a defendant must be
unable to appreciate in order to qualify as legally insane. **\[ ...
\]**The history of the Model Penal Code indicates that "wrongfulness"
was offered as a choice so that any legislature, if it wishes, could
introduce a "moral issue" into the test for insanity. Annual Meeting,
supra, p. 315, remarks of Wechsler.

There is little dispute in this case that, by choosing the term
"wrongfulness" instead of "criminality," the legislature intended to
import this moral element into Connecticut's insanity statute. Indeed,
Representative David H. Neiditz, the principal proponent of the public
act later codified at § 53a-13, stated that the term "wrongfulness" was
used in order to "include the case where the perpetrator appreciates
that his conduct is criminal but because of \[his\] illusion believes it
be *morally justified.* **\[ ... \]**

The more difficult question, and the issue that we asked the parties to
address at the reargument of this appeal; see footnote 11 of this
opinion; is how properly to define the moral element inherent in the
term "wrongfulness" under § 53a-13 (a).[**\[ ...
\]**](#X314099e3e88d7942d8191e5c9e04aa6eabe1316)The defendant contends
that morality must be defined in purely personal terms, such that a
defendant is not responsible for his criminal acts as long as his mental
disease or defect causes him *personally* to believe that those acts are
morally justified, even though he may appreciate that his conduct is
wrong in the sense that it is both illegal and contrary to societal
standards of morality. **\[ ... \]** The state, on the other hand,
contends that morality must be defined by societal standards, such that
a defendant is responsible for his criminal acts *unless,* because of
mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity to appreciate
that his actions were wrong under *society's* moral standards. Although
we agree with the state that the proper test must incorporate principles
of societal morality, we conclude that the state's interpretation of the
cognitive prong of § 53a-13 (a) does not sufficiently account for a
delusional defendant's own distorted perception of society's moral
standards. Accordingly, we conclude that a defendant may establish that
he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the "wrongfulness" of his
conduct if he can prove that, at the time of his criminal act, as a
result of mental disease or defect, he substantially misperceived
reality and harbored a delusional belief that society, *under the
circumstances as the defendant honestly but mistakenly understood them,*
would not have morally condemned his actions.

Before addressing the legislative and jurisprudential principles that
undergird our interpretation of § 53a-13 (a), however, we first must
consider the contrary view advanced by the defendant. We conclude that
**\[ ... \]**

the drafters of § 4.01 did not intend that a defendant who appreciates
*both* the illegality and the societal immorality of his actions be
relieved of criminal responsibility due to his purely personal, albeit
delusional, moral code.

**\[ ... \]**

Finally, with respect to the fundamental policies that undergird our
criminal law, defining the moral element of wrongfulness according to a
purely personal standard tends to undermine the "moral culture on which
our societal norms of behavior are based." **\[ ... \]**There may well
be cases in which a defendant's delusional ideation causes him to harbor
personal beliefs that so cloud his cognition as to render him incapable
of recognizing the broader moral implications of his actions. In such
cases, the defendant would be entitled to be acquitted under the
cognitive prong of the defense.

Those cases involving the so-called "deific command," in our view, fall
into this category. Contrary to the defendant's position at oral
argument, we are hard pressed to envision an individual who, because of
mental disease or defect, truly believes that a divine power has
authorized his actions, but, at the same time, also truly believes that
such actions are immoral. An individual laboring under a delusion that
causes him to believe in the divine approbation of his conduct is an
individual who, in all practicality, is unlikely to be able fully to
appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct. See id., 139-40; *People*
v. *Schmidt,* 216 N.Y. 324, 337, 110 N.E. 945 (1915) (if a person,
because of disease or delusion, "believes that he has a command from the
Almighty to kill, it is difficult to understand how such a man *can*
know that it is wrong for him to do it" **\[ ... \]**

A defendant should not be relieved of criminal liability, however, if
his mental illness does not deprive him of substantial capacity to
appreciate the boundaries of societal morality and if he elects to
transgress those boundaries in pursuit of a delusional personal belief
system that he appreciates society would not itself accept. To permit
otherwise "would seriously undermine the criminal law \[by allowing\]
one who violated the law to be excused from criminal responsibility
solely because, in his own conscience, his act was not morally wrong."
*State* v. *Crenshaw,* supra, 98 Wash. 2d 797.

**\[ ... \]**

In this regard, the test endorsed by the state is superior to the
personal test. **\[ ... \]**Although we agree with the state that the
defendant's appreciation of morality must be defined in terms of his
appreciation of society's moral standards; see I Model Penal Code,
supra, § 4.01, appendix C, p. 214; the state's test is insufficient in
one important respect. Consider, for example, a defendant who, because
of a mental delusion, misperceives reality and, on the basis of that
misperception, engages in criminal conduct that he believes is necessary
to advance a greater social good, but who, at the same time, also
appreciates that society is unaware of the need to bring about this
social good and, because of this ignorance, would not condone his
actions.[^209] Under the state's test, such an individual would probably
not be considered legally insane because he retains substantial capacity
to appreciate that, *objectively speaking,* society does not approve of
his actions.

In our view, such an approach represents an overly restrictive
interpretation of what the legislature intended by choosing the term
"wrongfulness" instead of the term "criminality-" Representative
Neiditz' statements in support of the legislation later codified at §
53a-13 indicate that "wrongfulness" was chosen in order to connote a
moral element with a meaning independent of illegality. Under the
state's test, however, moral wrongfulness would be measured strictly in
terms of society's objective disapproval; to the extent that this
objective disapproval is embodied in the criminal code, the state's test
renders morality and criminality virtually synonymous.[^210] We are
unwilling to negate the legislature's choice of the term "wrongfulness"
by treating these otherwise distinct terms as virtually identical.

We conclude, rather, that a defendant **\[ ... \]**would be entitled to
prevail under § 53a-13 (a) if, as a result of his mental disease or
defect, he sincerely believes that society *would* approve of his
conduct *if* it shared his understanding of the circumstances underlying
his actions. This formulation appropriately balances the concepts of
societal morality that underlie our criminal law with the concepts of
moral justification that motivated the legislature's adoption of the
term "wrongfulness" in our insanity statute.[**\[ ...
\]**](#Xd79c6c8d0b192d7beee7ad35c1a5ac68813f9a7)

**\[ ... \]**

Because the meaning of wrongfulness under § 53a-13 (a) was left unclear
and because that lack of clarity affected a central element of the
defendant's claim of insanity, we conclude that the trial court's
failure to define "wrongfulness" in terms of the defendant's
appreciation of societal morality constituted harmful error.

The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.

In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PETERS, Js., concurred.

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**^20^** For example, a defendant might, because of a mental delusion,
believe that his infant child suffers from a rare condition that will
cause her to die unless she ingests certain medication that he can
obtain only through theft. This hypothetical defendant might appreciate
that society, objectively speaking, would disapprove of him stealing the
medication but, nevertheless, may believe that, if society knew of his
child's condition, it would no longer view his theft of the medication
as immoral.

**\[ ... \]**

KATZ, J.,

concurring. "No aspect of the criminal justice system is more
controversial than is the insanity defense. Nowhere else does the
successful employment of a defense regularly bring about cries for its
abolition; no other aspect of the criminal law inspires position papers
from trade associations spanning the full range of professional and
political entities. When the defense is successful in a high-level
publicity case (especially when it involves a defendant whose 'factual
guilt' is clear), the acquittal triggers public outrage and serves
vividly as a screen upon which each relevant interest group can project
its fears and concerns." M. Perlin, The Jurisprudence of the Insanity
Defense (1994) p. 3. It would serve this court well to bear these
thoughts in mind as we navigate the ever murkier waters of insanity
jurisprudence in our attempt to set forth a standard for criminal
responsibility that readily may be understood and applied by our courts
and juries and that is also fair to the defendant who seeks to invoke
its protection.

I concur in the result reached by the majority, **\[ ... \]**I am
concerned, nonetheless, that the test as interpreted by the majority may
exclude certain defendants who are obviously impaired and for whom the
interests of justice would not be served by a criminal conviction;
specifically, those defendants who, *because of their mental illness,*
adhere to a personal code of morality.

**\[ ... \]**

In declaring that a defendant whose mental illness does not deprive him
of the substantial capacity to appreciate social boundaries yet who
nonetheless chooses to transgress those boundaries must be held
criminally responsible, the majority seeks to exclude those otherwise
sane individuals who would use the insanity defense as a shield when
seeking to satisfy personal grudges or to impose personal political
beliefs, a goal I wholeheartedly share. I disagree with the majority,
however, that the defense should not apply to an individual who is
mentally ill and *because of that illness* believes that society's rules
do not apply to his or her actions. It is my belief that such a person
is not *capable* of *appreciating* the legal and social import of his or
her acts, and, therefore, should not be held criminally responsible.

**\[ ... \]**

The majority has determined that under the Model Penal Code, a defendant
who "appreciates"[**\[ ...
\]**](#X61c79fec0e2e12a1d2e8347ff43839d5e7cb3f2)that society would not
approve of his or her actions cannot invoke the insanity defense, even
though that defendant is mentally ill and has acted under a delusional
adherence to apersonal moral code. I fail to understand the majority's
reasoning, however, in light of statements by Herbert Wechsler, the
chief reporter for the Model Penal Code**\[ ... \]** Although
recognizing that a defendant's personal moral code may be delusional,
the majority underestimates the pivotal role of that defendant's mental
illness. In other words, if the defendant's personal code is the *direct
result* of the mental illness, then I am hard-pressed to understand how
that defendant's knowledge of society's disapproval could be "a matter
of importance and reality . . . meaningful in the life of the
\[defendant\] . . . .''Id. I believe that such a defendant is unable to
truly appreciate, as defined by Wechsler, the "wrongfulness" of his or
her action. **\[ ... \]**

The majority cites to the model jury instructions in the Model Penal
Code in support of its conclusion that "wrongfulness" incorporates
societal standards. Reading one sentence further, however, I note that
Wechsler provides the jury with an example of a defendant who cannot
appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions: "If, for example, one has
such a diseased conception of his own relationship to other people that
he thinks himself to be an Oriental monarch, with absolute dominion over
those about him, including the privilege to deal with or to terminate
their lives as he sees fit, it hardly could be thought that such a
person has substantial power to appreciate that conduct of that kind is
contrary to both the law and moral standards that obtain in our
community." Id., p. 214. This, I would argue, is *precisely* the person
to whom the majority refers when it describes that individual who
adheres to a "personal, albeit delusional, moral code."

Those same instructions, in a passage immediately following a passage
extracted by the majority, describe "\[a\] person . . . who is so far
disoriented by disease that he is incapable of any feeling for the other
people in the world or of realizing their existence and importance, or
of distinguishing between his own identity and theirs, such a person
might be deemed to be without significant capacity to appreciate that it
is wrong to kill another man, although he says he knows that it is
wrong." I Model Penal Code, supra, § 4.01, appendix C, p. 215. Again,
this describes a defendant who, *as a, result of mental illness,*
believes himself removed from the mores of society.

**\[ ... \]**1 believe that the majority has given this aspect of **\[
... \]**the Model Penal Code test short shrift when it assumes, a
priori, that there can exist a defendant who, *because of a mental
disease or defect,* adheres to a personal code of morality, yet is
capable of not just an intellectual awareness of societal norms but
*fully appreciates* those norms. If an individual is so disturbed that
he or she honestly believes in the moral justification of his or her
actions by *any* standard, how can we say that he or she can appreciate
the wrongfulness of those actions?[**\[ ...

AN END TO INSANITY: RECASTING THE ROLE OF MENTAL DISABILITY IN CRIMINAL
CASES, Christopher Slobogin

 

 

ABSTRACT

This article argues that mental illness should no longer be the basis
for a special defense of insanity. Instead, mental disorder should be
considered in criminal cases only if relevant to other excuse doctrines,
such as lack of mens rea, self- defense and duress, as those defenses
have been defined under modern subjectively-oriented codes. With the
advent of these subjectively defined doctrines (a development which,
ironically, took place during the same period that insanity formulations
expanded), the insanity defense has outlived its usefulness, normatively
and practically. Modern official formulations of the defense are
overbroad because, fairly construed, they exculpate the vast majority of
people who commit serious crime. The most prominent alternative to the
official tests--the irrationality threshold--is also flawed because it
is based on the unprovable assumption that irrational people are less
able to act for good reasons. Acquitting only those who lacked mens rea
due to mental dysfunction or who acted on delusions that, if true, would
sound in self-defense or duress better captures the universe of people
who should be excused because of mental illness. This approach would
also enhance the image of the criminal justice system, improve treatment
of those with mental illness, and reduce the stigma associated with
being mentally ill.

\[\...\]

 

Insanity should be eliminated as a separate defense, but that the
effects of mental disorder should still carry significant moral weight.
More specifically, mental illness should be relevant in assessing
culpability only as warranted by general criminal law doctrines
concerning mens rea, self-defense and duress.

Acceptance of blameworthiness as the touchstone of the criminal law
means that individual culpability must be assessed. That is where the
kind of inquiry the insanity defense mandates comes into play. It is
meant to help us decide whom among those who commit criminal acts
deserve to be the subject of criminal punishment.10

The central assertion of this article, however, is that the insanity
defense does not adequatelycarryoutthisdefinitionaltask.
Atleastinitsmodernguises,theinsanitydefenseis overbroad. Instead, mental
disorder should be relevant to criminal culpability only if it supports
an excusing condition that, under the subjective approach to criminal
liability increasingly accepted today, would be available to a person
who is not mentally ill. The three most prominent such conditions would
be: (1) a mistaken belief about circumstances that, had they occurred as
the person believed, would amount to a legal justification; (2) a
mistaken belief that conditions exist that amount to legally-recognized
duress; and (3) the absence of intent to commit crime (i.e., the lack of
mens rea defined subjectively, in terms of what the defendant actually
knew or was aware of).

Before justifying this position, some examples of how it would apply in
well-known actual and hypothetical cases should be provided. Take first
the famous M\'Naghten case, from whence much of current insanity defense
jurisprudence derives.11 In 1841, Daniel M\'Naghten killed the secretary
of Prime Minister Peel, apparently believing the secretary was Peel and
that killing Peel would bring an end to a campaign of harassment against
him.12 He was found insane by the trial court judges. Whether M\'Naghten
would have been acquitted under the proposed approach would depend upon
whether he believed the harassment would soon lead to his death or
serious bodily harm and whether he thought there was any other way to
prevent that occurrence. Because in his paranoid state he feared he
would be assassinated by his enemies and had on several occasions
unsuccessfully applied to the police for protection,13 he may have had
such a defense. If, on the other hand, the circumstances in which he
thought he was involved would not amount to self- defense, no acquittal
would result14 (although a conviction of manslaughter rather than murder
might have been appropriate, analogous to the result under the modern
theory of "imperfect" self- defense as it has developed in connection
with provocation doctrine).

Now consider the case of John Hinckley, who convinced a jury he was
insane when he tried to kill President Reagan.15 If, as even his defense
attorneys asserted, John Hinckley shot President Reagan simply because
he believed Reagan\'s death would somehow unite him with 

actress Jodi Foster,16 he would be convicted under the proposed
approach. Regardless of how psychotic Hinckley may have been at the time
of the offense, he would not have an excuse under the proposed regime,
because killing someone to consummate a love affair is never justified,
nor is it deserving even of a reduction in charge.

Two other recent cases furnish additional exemplars. Jeffrey Dahmer
killed and cannibalized thirteen individuals. The jury was right to
convict him.17 As sick as his actions were, even he never thought they
were justified, and he would not be excused under the proposal. Lorena
Bobbitt, who cut off her husband\'s penis because he repeatedly beat
her, was found insane.18 Whether she would have a complete defense under
the proposal would depend, as it would with Daniel M\'Naghten, on the
extent to which she thought she had other ways of forestalling the
beating and whether the option she chose was disproportionate to that
threat. On the facts presented at trial,19 even on her own account her
act would probably not be considered necessary by the factfinder, and
she would therefore have been convicted of some version of assault.

In these cases, then, whether a defense existed under the proposed
approach would depend upon self-defense principles, applied to the
circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Another variety of
cases can be analyzed in terms of a similarly subjectified version of 

duress, which traditionally has excused crimes that are coerced by
serious threats to harm the perpetrator. For instance, some people with
mental illness who commit crime claim they were commanded by God to do
so.20 If the perceived consequences of disobeying the deity were lethal
or similarly significant, such a person would deserve acquittal, perhaps
even if the crime charged is homicide. On the other hand, contrary to
Justice Cardozo\'s famous hypothetical suggestion,21 the mere fact that
the defendant honestly believed God ordained a crime would not
automatically be an excuse.22

The third type of excuse that might apply when people with mental
illness commit crime\-- lack of mens rea--is extremely rare. M\'Naghten,
Hinckley, Dahmer, Bobbitt and Cardozo\'s hypothetical defendant all
intended to carry out their criminal acts. Indeed, most crimes in which
mental illness plays a role are intentional; the person who is so
disordered that he cannot form intent is often also so disorganized
behaviorally that he is unlikely to be able to carry out a criminal act.
Nonetheless, when mens rea is defined subjectively, there are at least
four possible lack-of-mens rea scenarios: involuntary action, mistake as
to results, mistake as to circumstances, and ignorance of the law.23

First, a person may engage in motor activity without intending it to
occur (e.g., a reflex action which results in a gun firing and killing
someone). The criminal law typically classifies such events as
involuntary acts.24 Although mental disorder usually does not eliminate
conscious control over bodily movements associated with crime, when it
does (e.g., in connection with 

epileptic seizures), a defense would exist if one accepts the premise
that culpability requires actual intent.25

Second, a person may intentionally engage in conduct but intend a
different result than that which occurs (such as when firing a gun at a
tree kills a person due to a ricochet). Distortions of perception caused
by mental illness might occasionally lead to such accidental
consequences; for instance, a mentally ill person driving a car may
accidentally hit someone because his "voices" and hallucinations prevent
him from perceiving the relevant sounds and visual cues. In such
situations a subjectively defined mens rea doctrine would absolve him of
criminal liability for any harm caused.

Closely related is the situation in which a person intentionally engages
in conduct and intends the physical result that occurs, but is under a
misapprehension as to the attendant circumstances (such as when a person
intentionally shoots a gun at what he thinks is a dummy but which in
fact is a real person). Of the various mens rea defenses, mental illness
is most likely to play a role here (in what has sometimes been labeled
the "mistake of fact" defense). For instance, a person who believes he
is shooting the devil when in fact he is killing a person26 or a person
who exerts control over property he delusionally believes to be his27
would be acquitted of homicide and theft, respectively, if mens rea is
subjectively defined. Another, more subtle example of this type of mens
rea defense is most likely to arise in connection with a person who is
mentally retarded rather than mentally ill. Like a young child, such a
person may kill not realizing that a life has been ended, because of an
incomplete conception of what life is; for instance, the offender may
believe the victim will rejuvenate like a cartoon character.28 Mens rea,
subjectively 

defined, would be absent in such a case because murder requires not only
an intentional killing, but also that the offender understands that the
victim is a human being who is capable of dying.29

Finally, a person may intentionally engage in conduct and intend the
result, under no misapprehension as to the attendant circumstances, but
still not intend to commit a crime because of an inadequate
understanding of what crime is. There are actually two versions of this
type of mens rea requirement. First, the person may not be aware of the
concept of crime (as might be true of a three year-old). Second, the
person may understand that criminal prohibitions exist but believe that
his specific act is legally permissible (such as might occur when a
person from a different country commits an act that would be perfectly
legal in his culture, although illegal in ours). The first situation
might be called "general" ignorance of the law, while the second might
be called "specific" ignorance of the law. Outside of the insanity and
infancy contexts, neither type of ignorance has been recognized as an
excuse for mala in se crimes.30 However, for reasons discussed in more
detail later in this article,31 a subjectively defined mens rea doctrine
should excuse at least general ignorance of the law, whether or not it
is due to mental disability, a position which would excuse those rare
individuals who intentionally carry out criminal acts without
understanding the concept of good and evil.

In short, the proposal would treat people with mental disorder no
differently from people who are not mentally ill, assuming (and this is
admittedly a big assumption) a modern criminal justice system that
adopts a subjective approach to culpability.

**HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA**

**THE KING against PORTER.**

**\[ ... \]**

Before explaining what that standard actually is, I wish to draw your
attention to some general considerations affecting the question of
insanity in the criminal law jn the hope that by doing so you may be
helped to grasp what the law prescribes. The purpose of the law in
punishing people is to prevent others from committing a like crime or
crimes. Its prime purpose is to deter people from committing offences.
It may be that there is an element of retribution in the criminal law,
so that when people have committed offences the law considers that they
merit punishment, but its prime purpose is to preserve society from the
depredations of dangerous and vicious people. Now, it is perfectly
useless for the law to attempt, by threatening punishment, to deter
people from committing crimes if their mental condition is such that
they cannot be in the least influenced by the possibility or probability
of subsequent punishment; if they cannot understand what they are doing
or cannot understand the ground upon which the law proceeds. The law is
not directed, as medical science is, to curing mental infirmities. The
criminal law is not directed, as the civil law of lunacy is, to the care
and custody of people of weak mind whose personal property may be in
jeopardy through someone else taking a hand in the conduct of their
affairs and their lives. This is quite a different thing from the
question, what utility there is in the punishment of people who, at a
moment, would commit acts which, if done when they were in sane minds,
would be crimes. What is the utility of punishing people if they be
beyond the control of the law for reasons of mental health? In
considering that, it will not perhaps, if you have ever reflected upon
the matter, have escaped your attention that a great number of people
who come into a Criminal Court are abnormal. They would not be there if
they were the normal type of average everyday people. Many of them are
very peculiar in their dispositions and peculiarly tempered. That is
markedly the case in sexual offences. Nevertheless, they are mentally
quite able to appreciate what they are doing and quite able to
appreciate the threatened punishment of the law and the wrongness of
their acts, and they are held in check by the prospect I of punishment.
It would be very absurd if the law were to withdraw that check on the
ground that they were somewhat different from their fellow creatures in
mental make-up or texture at the very moment when the check is most
needed. You will therefore see that the law, in laying down a standard
of mental disorder sufficient to justify a jury in finding a prisoner
not guilty on the ground of insanity at the moment of the offence, is
addressing itself to a somewhat difficult task. It is attempting to
define what are the classes of people who should not be punished
although they have done actual things which in others would amount to
crime. It is quite a different object to that which the medical
profession has in view or other departments of the law have in view in
defining insanity for the purpose of the custody of a person\'s
property, capacity to make a will, and the like. With that explanation I
shall tell you what that standard is.

The first thing which I want you to notice is that you are only
concerned with the condition of the mind at the time the act complained
of was done. That is the critical time when the law applies to the man.
You are not concerned, except for the purpose of finding out how he
stood at that moment, what his subsequent condition was or what his
previous condition was. He may have been sane before and he may have
been sane after, but if his mind were disordered at the time to the
required extent, then he should be acquitted on the ground of insanity
at the time he committed the offence. It is helpful in finding out how
he was at the time to find out how we has before and after. It is merely
because it is helpful that we go into it in this case, not because it is
decisive.

The next thing I wish to emphasize is that his state of mind must have
been one of disease, disorder or disturbance. Mere excitability of a
normal man, passion, even stupidity, obtuseness, lack of self-control,
and impulsiveness, are quite different things from what I have attempted
to describe as a state of disease or disorder or mental disturbance
arising from some infirmity, temporary or of long standing. If that
existed it must then have been of such a character as to prevent him
from knowing the physical nature of the act he was doing or of knowing
that what he was doing was wrong. **\[ ... \]**

State v. Singleton

 

---N.J.---

### STATE OF NEW JERSEY, Plaintiff-Appellant, 

### v.

### BOYCE SINGLETON, JR., Defendant-Respondent.

SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY

No. 067756

Argued January 31, 2012 -- Decided July 30,2012   

 

**\[ ... \]**

 

JUSTICE LaVECCHIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

**\[ ... \]**

In September 2005, defendant Boyce Singleton Jr. killed his pregnant
girlfriend, Michelle Cazan.  He was indicted and tried in June 2008, on
a charge of first-degree murder **\[ ... \]**  Defendant has never
disputed that he killed Cazan.  His defense at trial was keyed to
whether he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.  Afflicted
with schizoaffective disorder, defendant had developed the delusional
religious belief that he was in a form of communication with God and
that he was authorized to kill those who violated "God's word." **\[ ...
\]**

Defendant's insanity defense proved unsuccessful as the  jury convicted
him of murder**\[ ... \]** In a motion for a new trial, defendant
claimed for the first time that the jury should have been provided with
a variant of the insanity-defense jury charge informing the jury  that a
defendant can be found not guilty by reason of insanity  if he lacks the
capacity to understand that his actions are  morally wrong, even if he
understands that they are legally  wrong.  In Worlock, supra, we
recognized in dicta that such a  jury charge might be necessary in cases
where a defendant claims  to have been compelled by a "command from
God."  **\[ ... \]**  The court denied the motion for a new trial and 
imposed sentence on September 12, 2008.

Defendant appealed and a panel of the Appellate Division reversed the
conviction and remanded for a new trial based on finding the
insanity-defense jury charge to have been incomplete.  State v.
Singleton, 418 N.J. Super. 177, 204-05 (App. Div. 2011).  

**\[ ... \]**We now reverse.

 

## I.

##  

## A. Background   

 

**\[ ... \]** That testimony showed that defendant had developed a set
of delusional religious beliefs derived from his perspective on
scripture.  Importantly, he believes that he has an obligation to kill
sinners, especially sinners who attempt to deter him from honoring God's
word according to his strongly held, personal interpretation of the
Bible's Old Testament.  

Defendant's mental illness significantly manifested itself during his
relatively brief period of attendance at college.  In 2003, he turned to
religious study for guidance, discipline, and a means of control over
his life, but soon developed a preoccupation with the Bible and God and
became obsessed with the Old Testament.  His interpretation of scripture
developed into a delusional system that, the experts agree, distorts his
logical reasoning.  **\[ ... \]**

According to defendant, over time, he became convinced that he was a
"soldier" for God.  He testified that he came to believe that God
communicates with him, although he does not 6  claim to hear a distinct
voice speaking or commanding him.  Rather, he receives messages or
communications from God while
asleep.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xec3351c754dda29d093c57fcc9f4777e06354c6) As
he explained in his testimony, and in a statement to police after
Cazan's death, he felt a general obligation to kill sinners who did not
comport themselves in accordance with his beliefs about God's
expectations, once he explained those expectations to them.  **\[ ...
\]**

On July 27, 2005, he moved in with Michelle Cazan**\[ ... \]** a
participant in the same bible studies group as defendant's mother and
Shakia.  The relationship became intimate within one week's time and, on
September 12, 2005, Cazan told defendant that a home pregnancy test had
confirmed that she was pregnant.  Defendant killed her the next day. 
**\[ ... \]**

 

## B. Cazan's murder

 

On September 13, 2005, while Cazan was at work, defendant went with a
friend to an Air Force and Army recruiting center to discuss enlistment,
which he explained was motivated by a desire to help his "family,"
meaning his parents and siblings who were struggling, not Cazan.  He
claimed that he trusted in God to look after Cazan and the baby that was
on the way.  Still, he was conflicted about enlisting even to help his
parents and siblings because he would be working for money, which would
be contrary to his religious beliefs.  

That afternoon defendant picked up Cazan from work later than she
expected, causing her to miss an appointment she had  scheduled with an
organization that might have provided a source of employment for
defendant.  He knew that she was not happy about missing the
appointment, but testified that they did not argue about it.  However,
there was tension between the two and they had a discussion during which
he considered leaving Cazan's vehicle, but did not.  Instead, he agreed
to accompany her on a visit to her hometown of East Rutherford to see
places that were important to her, including her brother's gravesite.  

During the trip north, the two quarreled over their future.  Cazan was
concerned about his ability to provide for the baby.  As for defendant,
he had reached the conclusion that he would not enlist in military
service because he was uncomfortable with the idea of serving "a God
other than my God" by earning "evil" money.  And, he became increasingly
disturbed over Cazan's change of heart from earlier discussions in which
they had talked about going "into the woods" and living apart from a
money-based civilization.  He felt she had turned from the religious
beliefs and principles he thought they shared.  He grew more upset with
Cazan during that conversation because he felt as though she had not
fully adopted his religious beliefs and, worse, she was driving a wedge
between him and God.  He testified that he began to view Cazan "\[a\]s a
prostitute," because "she was prostituting herself to another God."
 Defendant said he "didn't trust her," and that he "didn't want **\[ ...
\]**  to be around her . . . \[or\] with her anymore."  Moreover, on
arriving in East Rutherford, defendant did not respond favorably as
Cazan showed him the area.  He said he became "enraged" by her "stories
of mob activity" that allegedly had occurred in the vicinity.  He
regarded her as "bragging" about it, which offended him.

At approximately 10:30 p.m., the two arrived home at Cazan's condominium
in Mansfield.  Defendant claims that, at this point, he was very upset. 
After using the first-floor bathroom, he went upstairs to the bedroom
where Cazan was and asked her to give him the keys to her BMW.  She
refused.  He admitted at trial that had she given him the keys he would
have left.  However, when she would not give him the car keys, he pulled
a revolver from his waistband and shot her four times, emptying the
gun.  One bullet went through her face and out behind her ear, another
entered her chest and passed through her rib cage, chest cavity, and
lungs, exiting through her lower back.  Forensic evidence showed that
Cazan was shot twice more in the back while on her hands and knees.  One
bullet traveled through her trachea and exited through her neck.  Cazan
began to choke on her own blood.  Defendant said he "didn't want her to
suffer," so he stabbed her, four times, in the chest and abdomen, one of
which pierced her lung.  The stab wounds were between three and six
inches in depth.  She died within minutes.

**\[ ... \]**

In explaining his killing of Cazan, he stated that he was angry because
of "that damn book," which he clarified as referring to the Bible.
 Defendant told the officers, "I lost it and the devil kept f\...ing
with me, he just kept f\...ing with me and I lost it . .   . ."  When
asked if anyone else was involved in Cazan's killing, defendant
answered, "No, the devil, god and the devil (inaudible) inside of me,
outside of me, all over the place, all over the place."  

  

## C.  Trial

 

**\[ ... \]**

At trial**\[ ... \]**Dr. Maureen Santina, a clinical and forensic
psychologist, testified as an expert for defendant.  She diagnosed
defendant with schizoaffective disorder which causes hallucinatory
experiences and delusional
perceptions. [^\[5\]^](#X9051690ad97471f06dee2162c7aeef3e07fa59d)  She
testified that as a result of his delusional system, defendant lost his
"ability to regulate his interpretation of the world and his reaction to
the world."  She explained that defendant became obsessed with his
delusions, including his belief that God wanted him to kill sinners,
even his own family, and concluded as follows: 

> I think that he knew that he was killing her but I don't think that he
> understood the nature of his killing her.  In other words, I think
> that he believed that he was supposed to kill her.  Whether he wanted
> to or not, he was supposed to kill her.  And that he was supposed to
> kill her because God was ordering it.

 

On redirect, Dr. Santina clarified,

> As I said, \[defendant\] believed that God was telling him to do it. 
> He said, I didn't want to kill her.  He in the past, had family
> members that he had said God was telling him to kill them because he
> was seeing these people as being bad.  And saying I don't want to do
> it but feeling he had to.  He even talked to himself as not having the
> courage to do what God wanted.
>
> So in that moment  when he feels that God wants him to do it he says I
> have to do it, I'm supposed to do it because God wants me to do it. 
> He believed that he was following God's word.  And God as being the
> supreme authority who has the right to decide what's right or wrong.

 

**\[ ... \]**

> The jury instruction that the court and all parties agreed would be
> given in this matter was the Model Jury Charge for the insanity
> defense.  Drawing from the model charge, the court instructed the jury
> as follows:
>
> Apart from his general denial of guilt, the defendant maintains that
> he is not guilty of the crimes charged by reason of insanity. . . .  
>
>  . . . .   
>
> A hostile act, that is an illegal act, may in one case spring from
> wickedness, and in another from some infirmity or sickness of the
> mind, which the  individual did not design. . . .
>
> . . . .  
>
> The law adopts a standard of its own as a test of criminal

> defendant was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of

> and therefore, not criminally responsible for his conduct.  
>
> As you can see, the law regards insanity as a disease of the mind.  It

The jury rejected defendant's insanity defense and convicted him of
murder and the other charges.  **\[ ... \]**  At sentencing, the court
imposed a fifty-year term of imprisonment, with an eighty-five percent
period of parole ineligibility, pursuant to the No Early Release Act,
N.J.S.A.  2C:43-7.2, on the murder conviction**\[ ... \]**

The insanity defense exists in criminal law not to identify the mentally
ill, but rather to determine who among the mentally ill should be held
criminally responsible for their conduct.  **\[ ... \]**  In New Jersey,
N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1 sets forth the test for legal insanity:

> A person is not criminally responsible for conduct if at the time of
> such conduct he was laboring under such a defect of reason, from
> disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act
> he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was
> doing was wrong.  Insanity is an affirmative defense which must be

N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1 codifies the common-law
M'Naghten[^\[7\]^](#X08fa8da4a09b72ca22106655408975f2ec624e1) test for
legal insanity, which was originally formulated in England in the
1840s.  **\[ ... \]** When the Legislature adopted N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1 in
1978, L.  1978, c. 95, it chose to preserve the M'Naghten test in spite
of a recommendation from the New Jersey Criminal Law Commission to
abandon it in favor of the Model Penal Code test.  **\[ ... \]**

The M'Naghten test provides two distinct paths for a defendant to
demonstrate that he was legally insane at the time he committed an act
and therefore not criminally responsible for his conduct.  First, a
defendant can show that "he was laboring under such a defect of reason,
from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the
act he was doing."  N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1.  Second, even if the defendant did
know the nature and quality of the act, he can still establish legal
insanity if, because of a "disease of the mind," "he did not know what
he was doing was wrong."  Ibid.

In the century-and-a-half since the M'Naghten test was formulated,
courts have recognized that the term "wrong" in the second part of the
test is susceptible of multiple interpretations.  **\[ ... \]** One
interpretation would equate the term "wrong" with illegality.  Under
that understanding, a defendant invoking the insanity defense must
demonstrate that despite knowing "the nature and quality of the act he
was doing," he suffered a disease of the mind that prevented him from
understanding that the act was illegal.  See N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1.  A
minority of states that follow the M'Naghten test have adopted that
interpretation. **\[ ... \]**

However, a majority of states following the M'Naghten test have
interpreted "wrong" as encompassing legal as well as moral wrong.  **\[
... \]** Under that interpretation, a defendant who understands that his
actions are contrary to law nonetheless may successfully invoke the
insanity defense if he lacked the capacity to understand that his
actions were morally wrong.  Courts that follow that approach generally
assess moral wrong from a societal, and not a personal, standard,
requiring a defendant to show that he did not understand that his
actions contravened generally accepted objective societal notions of
morality.  **\[ ... \]**

 

## B.  

 

Our Court addressed the ambiguity in the term "wrong" for the first time
in Worlock.  **\[ ... \]**

We held that the term "wrong" embraces more than just the concept of
legal wrong, id. at 610, and that "a defendant's ability to appreciate
society's morals may be relevant to the determination of his sanity,"
id. at 609.  Importantly, we added that

> \[i\]n the vast majority of cases, if the defendant was capable of
> understanding that he was acting contrary to law, he would also have
> sufficient capacity to understand that he was acting contrary to the
> morals of society.  Law is largely the crystallization of societal
> morals.  Rarely would an allegedly illegal act not also be wrongful
> morally.  Thus, "wrong" as used in the insanity defense will generally
> incorporate notions of both legal and moral wrong. \[Id. at 609-10.\]

 

Because legal and moral wrong are usually "coextensive," especially when
the criminal act at issue is murder, we held that a jury charge
explaining that "wrong" encompasses both legal and moral wrong is almost
always unnecessary and would more often than not only serve to confuse
the jury.  Id. at 610-11.  But, in the odd case in which a defendant is
able to recognize that his actions are legally wrong but is nonetheless
incapable of understanding that they are morally wrong, we held that
"the court should instruct the jury that 'wrong' encompasses both legal
and moral wrong."  Id. at 611.  

We emphasized that the insanity defense has always been premised on a
"defendant's ability to comprehend whether his or her actions would
ordinarily be disapproved by society."  Id. at 610.  Thus, we held that
"the concept of moral wrong must be judged by societal standards, not
the personal standard of the individual defendant.  As a general rule,
it will not be sufficient, therefore, that a defendant's personal moral
code justified a killing otherwise prohibited by law and societal
morals."  Ibid. (citations omitted).  In other words, in order to
warrant a jury charge explaining the concepts of legal and moral wrong,
a defendant would have to show that, at the time he committed the crime,
he believed that his actions were morally right under prevailing social
norms, not just his own "idiosyncratic code of morality."  Id. at 614.

We observed that there is only one "generally-recognized" situation in
which legal and moral wrong become sufficiently distinct to necessitate
a jury charge defining the term wrong:  when "the defendant contends
that he or she knowingly killed another in obedience to a command from
God."  Id. at 611.  In such a scenario, a defendant could justifiably
believe that although he acted contrary to law, society would consider
his actions to have been morally right.  Ibid.  **\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]**

**\[ ... \]** We said clearly in Worlock that "\[b\]elief in an
idiosyncratic code of morality does not constitute the defense of
criminal insanity."  1**\[ ... \]**"Worlock cracked open the door only
to a command delusion that, objectively viewed, could have rendered it
impossible for its hearer to know the difference between right and
wrong."  Winder, supra, 200 N.J. at 249. **\[ ... \]**

Applying to this case that stringent standard for qualification into the
narrow and clear class of case envisioned to satisfy a deific command to
kill, we conclude that the evidence does not clearly indicate that it
was impossible for defendant to appreciate that killing Cazan was
contrary to society's morals.  The Worlock variation of the
insanity-defense jury charge is not available to all those who intuit
reprehensible obligations or develop idiosyncratic moral compulsions
from interpreting religious material.  Were that all that was required
in order to constitute a deific "command," then acting pursuant to any
such personal belief system would qualify as lack of knowledge of having
committed "moral" wrong and a defendant would no longer have to show
that he believed that society would not objectively disapprove of the
moral wrongness of the action.  **\[ ... \]**

Here, defendant claimed to have formed a general belief that he ought to
kill sinners who refused to follow his explanation of God's
expectations.  **\[ ... \]**

Defendant's personal belief system was based on his own interpretation
of scripture, fortified through dreams in which he believed to receive
communications from God, which does not render his belief system in his
"right to kill" certain sinners the equivalent of a command from God to
kill.

Moreover, defendant had demonstrated on prior occasions the ability to
exercise his own will and resist the obligation he perceived from God's
teachings.  Defendant had chosen not to kill his family or their friends
despite his religious delusions generally and his specific belief,
expressed on occasion, that they were sinners.  Defendant also
determined that he would not kill anyone to whom he had not had a chance
to explain his religious beliefs.  For example, he decided that he would
not attempt to hurt or kill Britt's brother because defendant had not
taught him to believe in God's word as defendant interpreted it, and
also because he was bigger and apparently stronger than defendant. 
Defendant's inconsistent application of "God's will" and the concomitant
deific desire that he kill sinners, which he claims to have perceived,
and his reluctance to kill those whom he had not tried to convert,
indicates his awareness of an objective societal disapproval of the
personal religious belief system he had developed.  

Defendant also has failed to demonstrate entitlement to a Worlock charge
because the evidence does not clearly indicate that he was acting
pursuant to a delusional command at the time of the killing.  **\[ ...
\]**  There is a necessary temporal proximity to the action for which a
defendant is charged and the overbearing of his will by God's order or
command at the time of the action.  **\[ ... \]** Here, defendant
admitted that he never heard a voice or saw a vision that commanded him
to kill Cazan when he committed the murderous
act. [^\[10\]^](#X3c6d9d37102d94176beebd95dad204f59f91ac5)  Moreover
defendant admitted that he had not received any specific command to kill
Cazan at the moment of the killing, and indeed had not received any
communications from God for some time.

**\[ ... \]**

In sum, we conclude that the evidence does not clearly indicate
defendant killed Cazan as a result of a deific command.  Defendant was
entitled to assert an insanity defense, and he did.  He received an
insanity jury charge.  The trial court did not commit plain error by
failing to give, sua sponte, a Worlock  charge as part of the
insanity-defense jury instruction.  **\[ ... \]**

JUSTICE PATTERSON, concurring.

 

**\[ ... \]**

I write separately because in my opinion, the deific command concept is
neither mandated by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1 nor firmly rooted
in our jurisprudence, and should not be part of our law.  It invites a
defendant to exploit a core value of our society, respect for the
religious beliefs of others, for tactical advantage.  The deific command
concept does not meaningfully guide a jury's exploration of the
intricate issues raised by the insanity defense.  Instead, it can reduce
the dispassionate analysis of a defendant's mental state, envisioned by
the Legislature when it codified the insanity defense, to a superficial
review of the defendant's religious utterances.  Application of the
deific command results in inequitable treatment of defendants who have
committed similar crimes based on nothing more than one person's
assertion of a religious delusion.  In my view, a defendant's claim that
he or she heeded a deity's purported instruction to commit a murder or
other crime should not prompt a jury instruction that suggests a finding
of legal insanity within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1.

Neither the plain language nor the legislative history of N.J.S.A.
2C:4-1 warrants special consideration for defendants who claim that
deific commands prompted their crimes.  The statute at issue bars the
imposition of criminal responsibility for conduct if, at the time of the
crime, the defendant "was laboring under such a defect of reason, from
disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he
was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing
was wrong."  N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1.  The Legislature did not expressly or by
implication define the word "wrong" as used in N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1.  It
provided no instruction that a defendant's failure to comprehend that
his or her act was "wrong" should mean anything other than he or she did
not understand that it was an illegal act.

As the majority notes, the statute codified the test articulated by the
House of Lords in M'Naghten's Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (H.L. 1843), long
accepted as the formulation of the insanity defense in New Jersey case
law.  Statement to Senate Bill No. 738, at 3 (May 15, 1978).  The
M'Naghten rule, reflected in our statute, did not differentiate between
defendants who invoke deific commands and defendants who do not.  In
this Court's articulation of the M'Naghten rule \-- relied on by the
drafters of New Jersey's Penal Code, 2 Final Report of the New Jersey
Criminal Law Revision Commission, commentary to § 2C:4-1, at 96 (1971)
\-- the Court held that a defendant could invoke the insanity defense if
"the accused was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of
the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing,
or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was
wrong."  State v. Coleman, 46 N.J. 16, 39 (1965).  That construction,
adopted nearly verbatim by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 2C:4-1, refers to
"wrong" without reference to religious belief.  It does not contemplate
a deific delusion as part of the test for insanity. 

**\[ ... \]**

JUSTICE HOENS, dissenting.

 

**\[ ... \]**

No one disputes that defendant Boyce Singleton is mentally ill.  The
question before the Court today is whether the factual setting in which
he acted and the expert testimony concerning his mental status is
sufficient to meet the test that we have devised for the deific command
variation on the traditional insanity defense.  **\[ ... \]**More to the
point, the question before this Court is whether, in light of that
record, the trial court's failure to charge the jury in accordance with
Worlock was an error that entitles defendant to a new trial.  The
Appellate Division concluded that it was, as do I.  Therefore, I
respectfully dissent.   

 

## I.

 

**\[ ... \]**

Although the plain error standard is an exacting one, the record in this
case, fairly and objectively viewed, surely meets it.

Indeed, it is only by redefining the meaning of Worlock's deific command
variation on the insanity defense, by imposing a new and exceedingly
narrow view of the type of command that will qualify for that defense,
by altering our previously-accepted notion of the difference between a
true deific command and acts based on a personal moral code, and by
ignoring the abundant evidence adduced at trial through fact and expert
testimony in support of the conclusion that defendant fit within the
traditional bounds of the deific command defense, that the majority can
conclude that the failure to give the charge sua sponte did not amount
to reversible error.  In adopting this approach, the majority has
created a test so narrow as to be essentially non-existent.  **\[ ...
\]**

## II.

 

**\[ ... \]**First, the majority fails to recognize that the issue
presented in Worlock, as to which the deific command discussion was but
a small component, was nothing less than this Court's clear articulation
of the fundamental basis upon which we, and our Legislature, have
embraced a definition of insanity that includes both legal and moral
wrong.  **\[ ... \]** To dismiss that scholarly explanation on such an
important subject as a "narrow caveat," **\[ ... \]** suggests that the
majority deems both this Court's decision in Worlock and the entire
notion of the deific command defense to be unworthy of our attention.  

Second, the majority overemphasizes the confined focus that this Court
had in the more recent Winder decision, implying that Winder forged new
ground.  In fact, this Court in Winder merely recognized that a
defendant who acts based on a personal moral code cannot claim the
benefit of the deific command defense that we authorized in Worlock. 
**\[ ... \]**

Third, the majority's analysis of the record today alters the
distinction we recognized and applied both in Winder and in Worlock
between defendants who respond to true deific commands and those whose
criminal acts are instead motivated by adherence to a personal moral
code.  The defendant in Worlock believed that he was permitted to kill
his victims because "they're the folly-ridden mass, they're controlled
by their popular beliefs" and because he lived by the code of "might
makes right," not because he was responding to any deific directive. 
**\[ ... \]** The defendant in Winder contended that he feared his
parents were planning to kill him and murdered an innocent cab driver in
order to be sent to prison where he would be safe from them.  **\[ ...
\]** That logic, too, had all of the hallmarks of a purely personal code
of conduct and none of the criteria by which a deific command can be
identified.  **\[ ... \]**

The reliance on a moral code that is on its face rational but
unacceptable to our legal system is not a form of insanity.  But that is
not what deific commands are all about.  The reason that the deific
command qualifies as a defense to murder is that it is the one corner of
insanity in which legal and moral wrong do not coincide.  **\[ ... \]**

Fourth, the majority redefines Worlock and Winder to suit the current
purpose.  It does so by altering the meaning of deific command so that
it means one thing and one thing only, namely a direct, apparently
verbally transmitted, command from God to do a specific act that the
defendant then cannot help himself from carrying out.  **\[ ... \]**
That constricted version of the test serves only to substitute as part
of the fabric of our law an exceedingly narrow view of religious
traditions found only in the cinema.

More troubling to me, that articulation of the sort of command that the
majority now finds will define the Worlock  variant on the insanity
defense is sadly lacking in an understanding of either religion or
psychiatry.  While I do not profess to be expert in either, there is
abundant support for the proposition that deific commands come in many
forms and that courts do not reject the defense based on the manner in
which the instruction has been purportedly received or revealed.  **\[
... \]**

Fifth, the majority**\[ ... \]**proceeds **\[ ... \]** to draw its own
conclusions about the result it would have reached about whether
defendant was insane.  **\[ ... \]**

The fundamental error of the majority's analysis is that it tries to
make rational sense out of what in the end is clear evidence of a
disordered and delusional mind.  Mistaking a few glimmers of lucidity or
perhaps some sane behaviors for an organized thought process, the
majority finds so little evidence of the deific command that it deprives
defendant of the defense entirely.  In doing so, it inappropriately
substitutes its view for that of the finder of fact.

Doris, J.

The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether this court should
abandon the *M'Naghten* test in favor of a new standard for determining
the criminal responsibility of those who claim they are blameless by
reason of mental illness.[^211] *State* v. *Johnson,* 119 R.I. 749, 383
A.2d 1012, 1013 (1978). For the reasons stated herein, we have concluded
that the time has arrived to modernize our rule governing this subject.

Before punishing one who has invaded a protected interest, the criminal
law generally requires some showing of culpability in the offender. The
requirement of a mens rea, or guilty mind, is the most notable example
of the concept that before punishment may be exacted, blameworthiness
must be demonstrated. That some deterrent, restraint, or rehabilitative
purpose may be served is alone insufficient. It has been stated that the
criminal law reflects the moral sense of the community. "The fact that
the law has, for centuries, regarded certain wrongdoers as improper
subjects for punishment is a testament to the extent to which that moral
sense has developed. Thus, society has recognized over the years that
none of the three asserted purposes of the criminal law ---
rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution --- is satisfied when the
truly irresponsible, those who lack substantial capacity to control
their actions, are punished." *United States* v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d
606, 615 (2d Cir. 1966). The law appreciates that those who are
substantially unable to restrain their conduct are, by definition,
incapable of being deterred and their punishment in a correctional
institution provides no example for others.

The law of criminal responsibility has its roots in the concept of free
will. As Mr. Justice Jackson stated:

> "How far one by an exercise of free will may determine his general
> destiny or his course in a particular matter and how far he is the toy
> of circumstance has been debated through the ages by theologians,
> philosophers, and scientists. Whatever doubts they have entertained as
> to the matter, the practical business of government and administration
> of the law is obliged to proceed on more or less rough and ready
> judgments based on the assumption that mature and rational persons are
> in control of their own conduct." *Gregg Cartage & Storage Co.* v.
> *United States,* 316 U.S. 74, 78-80, 62 S.Ct. 932, 935, 86 L.Ed. 1283,
> 1288 (1942).

Our law proceeds from this postulate and seeks to fashion a standard by
which criminal offenders whose free will has been sufficiently impaired
can be identified and treated in a manner that is both humane and
beneficial to society at large. The problem has been aptly described as
distinguishing between those cases for which a correctional-punitive
disposition is appropriate and those in which a medical-custodial
disposition is the only kind that is legally permissible. *See* Model
Penal Code, §4.01, Comment at 156 (Tent. Draft. No. 4, 1955).

Because language is inherently imprecise and there is a wide divergence
of opinion within the medical profession, no exact definition of
"insanity" is possible. Goldstein, *The Insanity Defense* 87 (1967).
Every legal definition comprehends elements of abstraction and
approximation that are particularly difficult to apply in marginal
cases. Our inability to guarantee that a new rule will always be
infallible, however, cannot justify unyielding adherence to an outmoded
standard, sorely at variance with contemporary medical and legal
knowledge. Any legal standard designed to assess criminal responsibility
must satisfy several objectives. It must accurately reflect the
underlying principles of substantive law and community values while
comporting with the realities of scientific understanding. The standard
must be phrased in order to make fully available to the jury such
psychiatric information as medical science has to offer regarding the
individual defendant, yet be comprehensible to the experts, lawyers, and
jury alike. Finally, the definition must preserve to the trier of facts,
be it judge or jury, its full authority to render a final decision. *See
United States* v. *Smith,* 404 F.2d 720, 726 (6th Cir. 1968); *Bethea*
v. *United States,* 365 A.2d 64, 76 (D.C.Ct.App. 1976). These
considerations are paramount in our consideration of the rule to be
applied in this jurisdiction in cases in which the defense of lack of
criminal responsibility due to a mental illness is raised.

I

The historical evolution of the law of criminal responsibility is a
fascinating, complex story. For purposes of this opinion, however, an
exhaustive historical discussion is unnecessary; a brief sketch will
therefore suffice. The renowned "right-wrong" test had antecedents in
England as early as 1582. In that year the *Eirenarcha,* written by
William Lambard of the Office of the Justices of Peace, laid down as the
test or criminal responsibility "knowledge of good or evil." *See United
States* v. *Currens,* 290 F.2d 751, 764 (3dCir. 1961). During the 1700's
the language of the test shifted its emphasis from "good or evil" to
"know." *See United States* v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 616. During the
eighteenth century, when these tests and their progeny were evolving,
psychiatry was hardly a profession, let alone a science. Belief in
demonology and witchcraft was widespread and became intertwined with the
law of responsibility. So eminent a legal scholar as Blackstone
adamantly insisted upon the existence of witches and wizards as late as
the later half of the eighteenth centruy. Biggs, *The Guilty Mind* 61-62
(1955). The psychological theories of phrenology and monomania thrived
and influenced the development of the "right and wrong" test. Both of
these compartmentalized concepts have been soundly rejected by modern
medical science which views the human personality as a fully integrated
system. By historical accident, however, the celebrated case of Daniel
M'Naghten froze these concepts into the common law just at the time when
they were beginning to come into disrepute. *See generally id.* at
81-107.

Daniel M'Naghten attempted to assassinate Sir Robert Peel, Prime
Minister of England, but mistakenly shot Peel's private secretary
instead. This assassination had been preceded by several attempts on the
lives of members of the English Royal House, including Queen Victoria
herself. When M'Naghten was tried in 1843 the jury was charged with a
test heavily influenced by the enlightened work of Dr. Isaac Ray who was
severely critical of the "right and wrong" rule. *See* Ray, *Medical
Jursiprudence of Insanity* (1838). After the jury acquitted M'Naghten
the public indignation, spearheaded by the Queen, was so pronounced that
the Judges of England were summoned before the House of Lords to justify
their actions. In an extraordinary advisory opinion, issued in a
pressure-charged atmosphere, Lord Chief Justice Tindal, speaking for all
but one of the 15 judges, reversed the charge used at trial and
articulated what has become known as the *M'Naghten* rules. *See, e.g.,
United States* v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 617; *United States* v.
*Currens,* 290 F.2d at 763-64; Biggs, *supra* at 95-102; Glueck, *Mental
Disorder and the Criminal Law* 162-163 (1925). The principal rule in
*M'Naghten's Case,* 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843) states:

> "To establish a defense on the ground of insanity it must be clearly
> proved that, at the time of committing the act, the party accused was
> laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as
> not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he
> did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong." 8
> Eng. Rep. at 722.

This dual-pronged test, issued in response to the outrage of a
frightened Queen, rapidly became the predominant rule in the United
States.

This jurisdiction has long adhered to the *M'Naghten* standard for
determining criminal responsibility. In *State* v. *Quigley,* 26 R.I.
263, 58 A. 905 (1904), this court intimated that the dual-pronged test
of *M'Naghten* was the prevailing view in Rhode Island. Yet, in *State*
v. *Andrews,* 86 R.I. 341, 134 A.2d 425 (1957), where we expressly
adopted *M'Naghten,* reference was made only to the knowledge of "right
and wrong" portion of that test. *Id.* at 352, 134 A.2d at 432. Although
it has not always been clear whether the "nature and quality" component
of *M'Naghten* is included as part of the formal rule in this
jurisdiction, *compare State* v. *Page,* 104 R.I. 323, 332, 244 A.2d
258, 263 (1968) *and State* v. *Jefferds,* 91 R.I. 214, 216, 162 A.2d
536, 538 (1960) *with State* v. *Nault,* 112 R.I. 687, 690, 314 A.2d
627, 629 (1974), as a matter of practice expert witnesses testify
concerning both parts of the rule. *See State* v. *Page,* 104 R.I. at
332, 244 A.2d at 263. Unlike several other jurisdictions, Rhode Island
has never augmented *M'Naghten* with the "irresistible impulse
doctrine."

II

The *M'Naghten* rule has been the subject of considerable criticism and
controversy for over a century. *See generally United States* v.
*Currens,* 290 F.2d at 765-66. The test's emphasis upon knowledge of
right or wrong abstracts a single element of personality as the sole
symptom or manifestation of mental illness. *M'Naghten* refuses to
recognize volitional or emotional impairments, viewing the cognitive
element as the singular cause of conduct. *See United States* v.
*Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 618; *Durham* v. *United States,* 214 F.2d 862,
871-72 (D.C.Cir. 1954); Glueck, *supra* at 226-27, 428-29. One scholar
has stated that:

> "\[t\]he principle behind M'Naghten, namely, that defect of cognition
> as a consequence of mental disease is the primary exculpating factor
> in the determination of legal insanity, has probably never been other
> than a legal fiction." Diamond, *From M'Naghten to Currens, and
> Beyond,* 50 Calif.L.Rev. 189, 189 (1962).

*M'Naghten* has been further criticized for being predicated upon an
outmoded psychological concept because modern science recognizes that
"insanity" affects the whole personality of the defendant, including the
will and emotions. *Durham* v. *United States,* 214 F.2d at 871; *Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment, Report 80,* (1953). One of the most
frequent criticisms of *M'Naghten* has been directed at its all-
or-nothing approach, requiring total incapacity of cognition. *See Wade*
v. *United States,* 426 F.2d 64, 71 (9th Cir. 1970); *People* v. *Drew,*
22 Cal.3d 338, 337, 583 P.2d 1318, 1322, 149 Cal.Rptr. 275, 279 (1978);
*Hill* v. *State,* 252 Ind. 601, 607, 251 N.E.2d 429, 432 (1969). We
agree that:

> "Nothing makes the inquiry into responsibility more unreal for the
> psychiatrist than limitation of the issue to some ultimate extreme of
> total incapacity, when clinical experience reveals only a graded scale
> with marks along the way. \* \* \*

"The law must recognize that when there is no black and white it must
content itself with different shades of gray." Model Penal Code, §4.01,
Comment at 158 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).

By focusing upon total cognitive incapacity, the *M'Naghten* rule
compels the psychiatrist to testify in terms of unrealistic concepts
having no medical meaning. Instead of scientific opinions, the rule
calls for a moral or ethical judgment from the expert which judgment
contributes to usurpation of the jury's function as decision maker. *See
United States* v. *Currens,* 290 F.2d at 767; Weihofen, *Mental Disorder
as a Criminal Defense* 65 (1954).

Probably the most common criticism of *M'Naghten* is that it severely
restricts expert testimony, thereby depriving the jury of a true picture
of the defendant's mental condition. *See, e.g., United States* v.
*Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 620; *Hill* v. *State,* 252 Ind. at 606, 251
N.E.2d at 432. This contention has been seriously questioned by some
commentators who find no support for the argument that *M'Naghten*
inhibits the flow of testimony on the responsibility issue. Goldstein,
*supra,* at 53; *accord,* Matthews, *Mental Disability and the Criminal
Law* 44-46 (1970). As a matter of practice in this jurisiction, expert
testimony under *M'Naghten* has been unrestricted and robust.
Nevertheless, we are convinced that this testimony would be more
meaningful to the jury were it not for the narrow determination demanded
by *M'Naghten.*

That these criticisms have had a pronounced effect is evidenced by the
large and growing number of jurisdictions that have abandoned their
former allegiance to *M'Naghten* in favor of the Model Penal Code
formulation. *See* notes at 6 & 7 *infra.* We also find these criticisms
persuasive and agree that *M'Naghten's* serious deficiencies necessitate
a new approach.[^212]

III

Responding to criticism of *M'Naghten* as a narrow and harsh rule,
several courts supplemented it with the "irresistible impulse" test.
*E.g., Parsons* v. *State,* 81 Ala. 577, 2 So. 854 (1886); *See* Annot.
*Irresistible Impulse as an Excuse for Crime,* 173 A.L.R 391 (1948);
Keedy, *Irresistible Impulse as a Defense in the Criminal Law,* 100
U.Pa.L.Rev. 956 (1952). Under this combined approach, courts inquire
into both the cognitive and volitional components of the defendant's
behavior. Although a theoretical advance over the stringent right and
wrong test, the irresistible impulse doctrine has also been the subject
of wide-spread criticism. Similar to *M'Naghten's* absolutist view of
capacity to know, the irresistible impulse is considered in terms of a
complete destruction of the governing power of the mind. *See United
States* v. *Frazier,* 458 F.2d 911, 917 (8th Cir. 1972); *United States*
v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 620. A more fundamental objection is that the
test produces the misleading notion that a crime impulsively committed
must have been perpetrated in a sudden and explosive fit. Thus, the
irrestible impulse test excludes those "far more numerous instances of
crimes committed after excessive brooding and melancholy by one who is
unable to resist sustained psychic compulsion or to make any real
attempt to control his conduct." *Id.* at 620-21; *see United States* v.
*Smith,* 404 F.2d at 725.

The most significant break in the century-old stranglehold of
*M'Naghten* came in 1954 when the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia declared that, "an accused is not criminally responsible if his
unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect."
*Durham* v. *United States,* 214, F.2d 862, 874-75 (D.C.Cir. 1954). The
"product" test, first pioneered by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in
*State* v. *Pike,* 49 N.H. 399, 402 (1869), was designed to facilitate
full and complete expert testimony and to permit the jury to consider
all relevant information, rather than restrict its inquiry to data
relating to a sole symptom or manifestation of mental illness. *Durham*
generated voluminous commentary and made a major contribution in
recasting the law of criminal responsibility. In application, however,
the test was plagued by significant deficiencies. The elusive, undefined
concept of productivity posed serious problems of causation and gave the
jury inadequate guidance. *United States* v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 621.
Most troublesome was the test's tendency to result in expert witnesses'
usurpation of the jury function. As a result, in *Washington* v. *United
States,* 390 F.2d 444, 455-56 (D.C. Cir. 1967), the court took the
extreme step of proscribing experts from testifying concerning
productivity altogether. Finally, in *United States* v. *Brawner,* 471
F.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1972), the court abandoned *Durham,* decrying the
"trial by label" that had resulted. *Id.* at 977. The author of
*Durham,* Chief Judge Bazelon, stated that testimony couched in terms of
the legal conclusion that an act was or was not the product of mental
disease invited the jury to abdicate its responsibility as ultimate
decision maker and acquiesce in the experts' conclusions. *Id.* at 1017
(Bazelon, C.J., concurring & dissenting).

Several commentators have advocated abolition of the separate defense of
lack of criminal responsibility due to a mental illness. *See, e.g.,*
Dershowitz, *Abolishing the Insanity Defense; The Most Significant
Feature of the Administration's Criminal Code-An Essay,* 9 Crim.L.Bull.
434 (1973); Goldstein & Katz, *Abolish the "Insanity Defense"* --- *Why
Not?,* 72 Yale L.J. 853 (1963). Proponents contend that abolition would
result in the responsibility issue being more properly considered as the
existence vel non of the mens rea. Under a common proposal the criminal
process would be bifurcated; first, the jury would resolve the question
of guilt, and second, a panel of experts would determine, the
appropriate disposition. Arguably, abolition of the, separate defense is
subject to constitutional objections because it potentially abrogates
the right to trial by jury and' offends the guarantee of due process. We
believe that such a drastic measure, if advisable at all, is
appropriately left to the legislative process. *Accord., United States*
v. *Browner,* 471 F.2d at 985; *Bethea* v. *United States,* 365. A.2d at
73 n.19.

IV

Responding to the criticism of the *M'Naghten* and irresistible impulse
rules, the American Law Institute incorporated a new test of criminal
responsibility into its Model Penal Code.[^213] The Model Penal Code has
received widespread and evergrowing acceptance. It has been adopted with
varying degrees of modification in 26 states and by every federal court
of appeals that has addressed the issue. Although no definition can be
accurately described as the perfect or ultimate pronouncement, we
believe that the Model Penal Code standard represents a significant,
positive improvement over our existing rule. Most importantly, it
acknowledges that volitional as well as cognitive impairments must be
considered by the jury in its resolution of the responsibility issue.
The test replaces *M'Naghtens* unrealistic all-or-nothing approach with
the concept of "substantial" capacity. Additionally, the test employs
vocabulary sufficiently in the common ken that its use at trial will
permit a reasonable three-way dialogue between the law-trained judges
and lawyers, the medical-trained experts, and the jury. *See United
States* v. *Brawner,* 471 F.2d at 983.

Without question the essential dilemma in formulating any standard of
criminal responsibility is encouraging a maximum informational input
from the expert witnesses while preserving to the jury its role as trier
of fact and ultimate decision maker. As one court has aptly observed:

> "At bottom, the determination whether a man is or is not held
> responsible for his conduct is not a medical but a legal, social or
> moral judgment. Ideally, psychiatrists --- much like experts in other
> fields --- should provide grist for the legal mill, should furnish the
> raw data upon which the legal judgment is based. It is the
> psychiatrist who informs as to the mental state of the accused --- his
> characteristics, his potentialities, his capabilities. But once this
> information is disclosed, it is society as a whole, represented by
> judge or jury, which decides whether a man with the characteristics
> described should or should not be held accountable for his acts."
> *United States* v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 619-20.

Because of our overriding concern that the jury's function remain
inviolate, we today adopt the following formulation of the Model Penal
Code test:

> A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of
> such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, his capacity
> either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his
> conduct to the requirements of law is so substantially impaired that
> he cannot justly be held responsible.
>
> The terms "mental disease or defect" do not include an abnormality
> manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial
> conduct.[^214]

There are several important reasons why we prefer this formulation. The
greatest strength of our test is that it clearly delegates the issue of
criminal responsibility to the jury, thus precluding possible usurpation
of the ultimate decisioniby the expert witnesses. Under the test we have
adopted, the jury's attention is appropriately focused upon the legal
and moral aspects of responsibility because it must evaluate the
defendant's blameworthiness in light of prevailing community standards.
Far from setting the jury at large, as in the majority Model Penal Code
test the defendant must demonstrate a certain form of incapacity. That
is, the jury must find that a mental disease or defect caused a
substantial impairment of the defendant's capacity to appreciate the
wrongfulness of his act or to conform his conduct to legal requirements.
Our new test emphasizes that the degree of "substantial" impairment
required is essentially a legal rather than a medical question. Where
formerly under *M'Naghten* total incapacity was necessary for
exculpation, the new standard allows the jury to find that incapacity
less than total is sufficient. Because impairment is a matter of degree,
the precise degree demanded is necessarily governed by the community
sense of justice as represented by the trier of fact.

Several other components of our new test require elucidation. Our test
consciously employs the more expansive term "appreciate" rather than
"know." Implicit in this choice is the recognition that mere theoretical
awareness that a certain course of conduct is wrong, when divorced from
appreciation or understanding of the moral or legal impact of behavior,
is of little import. *See United States* v. Freeman, 357 F.2d at 623. A
significant difference from our former rule is inclusion in the new test
of the concept that a defendant is not criminally responsible if he
lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements
of law. As we noted at the outset, our law assumes that a normal
individual has the capacity to control his behavior; should an
individual manifest free will in the commission of a criminal act, he
must be held responsible for that conduct. Mental illness, however, can
effectively destroy an individual's capacity for choice and impair
behavioral controls.

The drafters of the Model Penal Code left to each jurisdiction a choice
between the terms "wrongfulness" and "criminality." We prefer the word
"wrongfulness" because we believe that a person who, knowing an act, to
be criminal, committed it because of a delusion that the act was morally
justified, should not be automatically foreclosed from raising the
defense of lack of criminal responsibility.[^215]

The second paragraph of our test is designed to exclude from the concept
of "mental disease or defect" the so-called psychopathic or sociopathic
personality. *See* Model Penal Code, §4.01, Comment at 160, (Tent.
Draft. No. 4, 1955). We have included this language in our test to make
clear that mere recidivism alone does not justify acquittal. *See United
States* v. *Freeman,* 357 F.2d at 625; *Bethea* v. *United States,* 365
A.2d at 80-81. We recognize that this paragraph has been the source of
considerable controversy. *See, e.g., Wade* v. *United States,* 426 F.2d
64, 72-73 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Smith, 404 F.2d at 727, n.8;
Diamond,. *From M'Naughten to Currens, and Beyond,* 50 Calif. L. Rev.
189, 194 (1962). Nevertheless, we believe that its inclusion in our test
is necessary to minimize the likelihood of the improper exculpation of
defendants who are free of mental disease but who knowingly and
deliberately pursue a life of crime.

V

As we have emphasized previously, preserving the respective provinces of
the jury and experts is an important concern. Consonant with modern
medical understanding, our test is intended to allow the psychiatrist to
place before the jury all of the relevant information that is must
consider in reaching its decision. We adhere to Dean Wigmore's statement
that when criminal responsibility is in issue, *"any and all conduct* of
the person is admissible in evidence." 2 Wigmore, *Evidence* §228
(1940). Nevertheless, the charge to the jury must include unambiguous
instructions stressing that regardless of the nature and extent of the
experts' testimony, the issue of exculpation remains at all times a
legal and not a medical question. In determining the issue of
responsibility the jury has two important tasks. First, it must measure
the extent to which the defendant's mental and emotional processes were
impaired at the time of the unlawful conduct. The answer to that inquiry
is a difficult and elusive one, but no more so than numerous other facts
that a jury must find in a criminal trial. Second, the jury must assess
that impairment in light of community standards of blameworthiness. The
jury's unique qualifications for making that determination justify our
unusual deference to the jury's resolution of the issue of
responsibility. *See United States* v. *Eichberg, 439* F.2d 620, 624-25
(D.C. Cir. 1971) (Bazelton, C.J., concurring & dissenting). For it has
been stated that the essential feature of a jury "lies in the
interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense
judgment of a group of laymen, and in the community participation and
shared responsibility that results from that group's determination of
guilt or innocence." *Williams* v. *Florida,* 399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct.
1893, 1906, 26 L.Ed.2d 446, 460 (1970). Therefore, the charge should
leave no doubt that it is for the jury to determine: 1) the existence of
a cognizable mental disease or defect, 2) whether such a disability
resulted in a substantial impairment at the time of the unlawful conduct
of the accused's capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his
conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, and
consequently, 3) whether there existed a sufficient relationship between
the mental abnormality and the condemned behavior to warrant the
conclusion that the defendant cannot justly be held responsible for his
acts.

VI

So there will be no misunderstanding of the thrust of this opinion,
mention should be made of the treatment to be afforded individuals found
lacking criminal responsibility due to a mental illness under the test
we have adopted. Unquestionably the security of the community must be
the paramount interest. Society withholds criminal sanctions out of a
sense of compassion and understanding when the defendant is found to
lack capacity. It would be an intolerable situation if those suffering
from a mental disease or defect of such a nature as to relieve them from
criminal responsibility were to be released to continue to pose a threat
to life and property. The General Laws provide that a person found not
guilty because he was "insane" at the time of the commission of a crime
shall be committed to the Director of the State Department of Mental
Health for observation. At a subsequent judicial hearing if he is found
to be dangerous, the person must be committed to a public institution
for care and treatment. G.L. 1956 (1968 Reenactment) §26-4-4. This
procedure insures society's protection and affords the incompetent
criminal offender necessary medical attention.

Our test as enunciated in this opinion shall apply to all trials
commenced after the date of this opinion. The defendant in the instant
case is entitled to a new trial solely on the issue of criminal
responsibility.

The defendant's appeal is sustained and the case is remanded to the
Superior Court for a new trial in accordance with the opinions expressed
herein.

Assistant Attorney General, *E. Martin Stutchfield,* Special Assistant
Attorney General, for plaintiff.

314 A.2d 627, 628 n.1 (1974), we prefer to avoid use of the term
"insanity defense." Therefore, throughout this opinion we shall use the
phrase "\[defense\] of lack of criminal responsibility due to a mental
illness."

**^5^** "(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the
time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks
substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality
\[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the
requirements of law.

"(2) As used in this article, the terms 'mental disease or defect' do
not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or
otherwise antisocial conduct." Model Penal Code, §4.01 (Final Draft,
1962).

**^8^** This test was proposed as an alternative by the minority of the
American Law Institute Council that drafted the Model Penal Code. One of
its most forceful advocates was Professor Herbert Wechsler, the reporter
for the Model Penal Code. See Wechsler, *The Criteria of Criminal*
Responsibility, 22 U. Chi. L. Rev. 367, 372 (1955). The test is
substantially similar to the tests proposed by the British Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment in 1953, *see United States* v.
*Brawner,* 471 F.2d at 986 n.23 and by Chief Judge Bazelon in 1972, *see
id.* at 1030-34 (Bazelon, C.J., concurring & dissenting). The majority
of the A.L.I. Council rejected this alternative because they deemed it
unwise to present questions of justice to the jury. As this opinion
indicates, we believe that the jury's resolution of the responsibility
issue is in the final analysis always predicated upon the community
sense of justice and it is preferable to be forthright about the basis
of that decision.

SULLIVAN, Justice.

Despite nonconflicting expert and lay opinion testimony that defendant
Gregory Galloway was insane, the trial court rejected the insanity
defense after concluding that the defendant could continue to be a
danger to society because of an inadequate State mental health system.
This was insufficient to sustain the trial court\'s finding because
there was no probative evidence from which an inference of sanity could
be drawn.

## Background

The defendant, Gregory Galloway, was found guilty but mentally ill for
the October, 2007,
murder[^\[1\]^](#X103afd981a50ed32defe903e103f6088a26d895) of his
grandmother, Eva B. Groves. The defendant raised the \"insanity
defense\"[^\[2\]^](#Xab3fcae2d2abeabe22d3df13547617915c71951) at his
bench trial. The trial court found that although the defendant had a
long history of mental illness, he did not meet his burden of proving
that he was \"insane\" at the time of the crime.

The trial court concluded, based on the expert testimony and the
numerous medical records introduced into evidence, that the defendant
suffers from bipolar disorder, an Axis I psychiatric
disorder.[^\[3\]^](#X19923a3563716c5327f70a69a2eae275848d921) This
evidence showed that prior to his killing \[704\] his grandmother, the
defendant had had a long history of mental illness, and he had had many
\"contacts\" with the mental health
system.[^\[4\]^](#X162401337ef39949068a8cd4a4f0978b3e7053b) He had been
diagnosed with bipolar disorder by up to twenty different physicians,
often with accompanying psychotic and manic symptoms. He had also been
voluntarily and involuntarily detained or committed for short-term
treatment more than fifteen times.

The defendant was first diagnosed with an Axis I mental illness in 1989,
when he was a senior in high school. By 2000, his mental health became
more problematic; he had difficulty holding a steady job, he struggled
with substance
abuse,[^\[5\]^](#Xee6d29c459dc706f01c935fcc906b9be744e605) and his
marriage failed. Despite these difficulties, he had very few encounters
with law enforcement that were not traffic or mental illness related.
After his divorce, the defendant moved in with his grandmother, who
lived next door to his parents. He had a great relationship with his
grandmother; \"he loved \[her\] very much and considered \[her to be\]
his best friend.\" Appellant\'s Br. 3; *see also* Appellant\'s App. 183;
Tr. 40-41, 83-84, 175.

Since 2001, the defendant experienced psychotic episodes with increased
frequency and severity. *See* *Galloway v. State,* 920 N.E.2d 711,
713-14 (Ind.Ct.App.2010) (chronicling the defendant\'s psychotic
episodes). For instance, in February, 2002, he was involuntarily
committed after his parents found him with a gun and looking for
ammunition --- he planned to kill his grandmother because she was the
devil and he was Jesus Christ, and he planned to kill his neighbor
because he believed his neighbor was controlling his son. Then in June,
2004, the defendant drove to Dayton, Ohio, after God told him to leave
his job; he was hospitalized in Ohio after being found in a stranger\'s
driveway looking for the perfect wife for the son of God. In July, 2005,
the defendant was admitted to a hospital after crashing his car during a
car chase with his mother; he believed she was the devil and was chasing
her so that he could kill her, and he believed he was protected because
he was an alien.

In the year leading up to the murder, the defendant had at least twelve
contacts with the mental health system. In January, 2007, he pulled over
on the side of the interstate near Lafayette, Indiana, got out of his
car, and began erratically yelling and talking to himself. Because the
air temperature was 27 degrees, concerned bystanders called the police.
When the medics arrived, he was sitting in the back of a police car; his
skin was cold to the touch, and there were ice particles in the facial
hair under his nose. At the emergency room, the defendant was
uncooperative, mumbling to himself, acting aggressively toward staff,
and reacting to audio and visual hallucinations; he was admitted to a
Lafayette hospital for a few days.

In March, 2007, after refusing to eat or sleep for one week because he
was fearful of something bad happening to him, the defendant lacerated
his stomach while trying \[705\] to get into his grandmother\'s house
through a window after he was accidentally locked out. At the emergency
room, he was attending to internal stimuli, having difficulty
concentrating, and experiencing auditory hallucinations and paranoid
delusions. He was transferred to an Anderson hospital, where he was
confused and disoriented, detached from reality, and in a catatonic-like
state; he was discharged after a few days. Several days later, the
defendant was involuntarily committed after the court found him to be a
danger to himself because he did not know who or where he was, he had
been staying awake all night, he had been trying to sleep with his
parents in their bed because he believed someone was in his room, and he
was hearing voices; again, he was released after a few days.

In June, 2007, the defendant was admitted to a hospital in Tennessee
after police found him driving a semi-truck full of gasoline,
threatening to blow up a gas station; he was confused and disoriented,
responding to internal stimuli and laughing inappropriately,
experiencing racing thoughts and auditory hallucinations, and had not
slept for three days. He was discharged from the Tennessee hospital
within days. A few days later, he went to counseling where he was
delusional about raping a girl (there was no evidence that any rape had
occurred). He did not take medications prescribed for him in Tennessee.

In the days leading up to the murder, the defendant heard voices and
thought that his grandmother\'s trailer was haunted. To abate his fears,
he slept on the floor next to his parents\' bed while holding his
mother\'s hand. The night before the murder, he drank a pint of whiskey,
finishing around 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., and did not sleep.

The defendant reported feeling strange on October, 26, 2007, the morning
of the murder. He was supposed to pick up his friend from work, but he
refused to do so because he was feeling strange. When the friend called
to ask about the ride, the defendant uncharacteristically yelled at him.
The defendant also spoke with his father that morning, and during their
conversation, his father became concerned because his son was not acting
normal and seemed to be in another world. The defendant told the police
that during this conversation, his father was telling him through coded
verbal messages that he needed to kill his grandmother.

During the early afternoon, the defendant went shopping with his
grandmother and his aunt (the victim\'s daughter). They shopped for only
fifteen minutes and then went to lunch, though the defendant did not eat
much. While eating lunch, the defendant began thinking that his
grandmother was against him and \"that life should be more colorful\"
and that it would be if she were gone-life would be better again once he
killed his grandmother. Appellant\'s App. 194. He believed that she was
the devil, that she was out to get him, and that he needed to kill her
to restore his powers. As they sat there eating, he was hoping that his
grandmother would die. After lunch, they stopped at a gas station, where
the defendant pumped their gas and purchased cigarettes. They returned
home a little more than an hour after they had originally left; there
had been no arguments, and nothing unusual had occurred during their
outing. On the way home, the defendant\'s grandmother remarked that it
had been a wonderful day.

Once they arrived home, the defendant went next door to his parents\'
house while his grandmother and aunt sat on a couch inside the
grandmother\'s trailer and talked. While at his parents\' house, the
defendant began believing that he was \[706\] reading his father\'s
mind; his father was communicating telepathically, telling the defendant
that he needed to kill his grandmother \"to feel good again\[,\] to see
like the bright lights and the flowers and the pretty things.\"
Appellant\'s App. 194.

The defendant then went back to his grandmother\'s house and sat on the
porch swing. Shortly thereafter, the defendant\'s fifteen-year-old son,
Cory, arrived and said \"hi\" to his dad. Cory had seen his father cycle
from normal to psychotic before and could tell that something was not
quite right. At the same time, the defendant\'s father, who had come
over from next door, was entering the grandmother\'s house.

The defendant entered the house at the same time as his father and went
to his bedroom, grabbed his knife, and came back down the hallway to the
living room, where his aunt and grandmother were sitting on a couch.
According to his aunt, the defendant had a \"wild look\" in his eye that
she had seen before --- it was the look he gets right before he
\"lose\[s\] it.\" Tr. 60. With his father, son, and aunt in the room,
and with no plan or motive, the defendant jumped on top of his
grandmother, straddled her, and stabbed her in the chest while yelling
\"you\'re going to die, I told you, you\'re the devil.\" Tr. 50, 74-75.
His father yelled, \"What have you done!,\" and the defendant responded
that she \"was going to kill me.\" Tr. 86.

As soon as everyone started screaming, the defendant realized that he
did not feel better like he thought he would, and he hoped that his
grandmother would survive. His father was able to commandeer the knife
and store it in a safe place until the police arrived. As the
defendant\'s son applied pressure to the wound, the defendant told his
grandmother that he loved her and that he did not mean to do it. He
pleaded for the paramedics to save his grandmother\'s life. When the
police arrived, he told them that he loved his grandmother and would not
hurt her. When the police were getting ready to take him to the police
station, he did not understand what was happening and asked where he was
going. But he was cooperative during the police interrogation, which
occurred two-and-a-half hours later.

Prior to trial, the defendant was examined by three experts: Dr. Parker,
a psychiatrist engaged by the defense; Dr. Coons, a court-appointed
psychiatrist; and Dr. Davidson, a court-appointed psychologist. All
three experts agreed that he suffers from a mental illness, suffers
paranoid delusions (a symptom of severe psychosis), and has suffered
from intermittent psychosis since 1999. Dr. Parker and Dr. Coons both
testified (and submitted in their preliminary reports) that the
defendant was legally insane at the time of the murder. They both opined
that he was jolted out of his delusion when he realized that he did not
feel better and had just harmed someone he loved. The psychologist, Dr.
Davidson, submitted a preliminary opinion to the court that the
defendant was sane at the time of the murder. The basis for his opinion
was that it was unlikely the defendant would have been insane only for
the few moments that it took for him to grab the knife and stab his
grandmother. But while testifying, Dr. Davidson withdrew his opinion in
light of additional facts that he did not have when he submitted his
preliminary opinion. Among other things, Dr. Davidson was unaware that
the defendant had been experiencing delusions and responding to internal
stimuli in the days leading up to the murder and on the day of the
murder. Dr. Davidson also was unaware that eyewitnesses heard the
defendant call his grandmother the devil as he stabbed her. After being
presented with all of the facts while on the witness stand, Dr. Davidson
\[707\] ultimately testified that he could not give an opinion on the
matter.

After the close of trial, but before a verdict was rendered, the
defendant stopped taking his medication and deteriorated to the point
where he was found incompetent to stand trial. He regained competence
after treatment at a state mental hospital.

On May 4, 2009, the trial court found the defendant guilty but mentally
ill for murdering his grandmother, rejecting the insanity defense.
Finding that none of the experts or lay witnesses testified that the
defendant was sane, the trial court based its conclusion on demeanor
evidence. Specifically, the court found that the defendant and his
grandmother had interacted with each other and other people on the day
of the murder, he had committed the offense in front of several family
members and made no effort to conceal his crime, he had not attempted to
evade police, and he had cooperated with law enforcement. Additionally,
the defendant had been alert and oriented throughout the trial
proceedings and had been able to assist counsel. The court also found
that the defendant\'s \"psychotic episodes increased in duration and
frequency\" and that he \"lacks insight into the need for his prescribed
medication.\" Appellant\'s App. 255. The court then found that the
defendant had \"repeatedly discontinued medication because of side
effect complaints and would self medicate\" by abusing alcohol and
illicit drugs. *Id.* Furthermore, there was \"no evidence that this
pattern of conduct \[would\] not continue if the Defendant \[were\]
hospitalized and released, posing a danger to himself and others in the
community.\" *Id.* The court concluded that the defendant \"is in need
of long term stabilizing treatment in a secure facility.\" *Id.*

During the sentencing hearing, on June 2, 2009, the trial court
indicated that the preferred route would be to commit the defendant to a
mental health facility for the rest of his life but concluded that route
was not an option.

\[708\] Tr. 389-91. After considering the aggravating and mitigating
factors under *Weeks v. State,* 697 N.E.2d 28, 30 (Ind.1998), the court
sentenced the defendant to 50 years imprisonment.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\'s conviction, holding that
this Court\'s decision in *Thompson v. State,* 804 N.E.2d 1146
(Ind.2004), compelled such a result. *Galloway,* 920 N.E.2d at 720. The
Court of Appeals interpreted *Thompson* as holding that where a
defendant appeals claiming that his insanity defense should have
prevailed, the conviction must be affirmed \"if there is any evidence
whatsoever supporting the verdict, no matter how slight.\" *Id.*

The defendant sought, and we granted, transfer, *Galloway v. State,* 929
N.E.2d 790 (Ind.2010) (table), thereby vacating the opinion of the Court
of Appeals, Ind. Appellate Rule 58(A).

## Discussion

## 

## I

To sustain a conviction, the State must prove each element of the
charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. *See* I.C. § 35-41-4-1(a);
*see also* *In re Winship,* 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d
368 (1970). Even where the State meets this burden, a defendant in
Indiana can avoid criminal responsibility by successfully raising and
establishing the \"insanity
defense.\"[^\[6\]^](#X986f9bdd00fec64fea4ea9d9341fc0dd5754107) *See*
I.C. § 35-41-3-6(a). A successful insanity defense results in the
defendant being found not responsible by reason of insanity (\"NRI\").
*See* I.C. §§ 35-36-2-3, -4.

The defendant bears the burden of establishing the insanity defense by a
preponderance of the
evidence.[^\[7\]^](#X8ef64c56d07b4d02265fb192cdcde16389167c6) I.C. §
35-41-4-1(b). To meet this burden, the defendant must establish both (1)
that he or she suffers from a mental illness and (2) that the mental
illness rendered him or her unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his
or her conduct at the time of the
offense.[^\[8\]^](#X3cbb730db398f77b358270e839a76d6b087fc56) *See* I.C.
§ 35-41-3-6(a). Thus, mental illness alone is not sufficient to relieve
criminal responsibility. *See* *Weeks v. State,* 697 N.E.2d 28, 29
(Ind.1998). Rather, a defendant who is mentally ill but fails to
establish that he or she was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of
his or her conduct may be found guilty but mentally ill
(\"GBMI\").[^\[9\]^](#X844fb1f6ebb2b271e0b34f591d8b6209f352ace) *See,
e.g.,* *Taylor v. State,* 440 N.E.2d 1109, 1112 (Ind.1982).

\[709\] Whether a defendant appreciated the wrongfulness of his or her
conduct at the time of the offense is a question for the trier of fact.
*Thompson v. State,* 804 N.E.2d 1146, 1149 (Ind.2004). Indiana Code
section 35-36-2-2 provides for the use of expert testimony to assist the
trier of fact in determining the defendant\'s
insanity.[^\[10\]^](#X0328cb8bc5b3b5f4726d965c3ae6eddca8828da) Such
expert testimony, however, is merely advisory, and even unanimous expert
testimony is not conclusive on the issue of sanity. *Cate v. State,* 644
N.E.2d 546, 547 (Ind.1994). The trier of fact is free to disregard the
unanimous testimony of experts and rely on conflicting testimony by lay
witnesses. *Barany v. State,* 658 N.E.2d 60, 63 (Ind.1995). And even if
there is no conflicting lay testimony, the trier of fact is free to
disregard or discredit the expert testimony. *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at
1149.

Because it is the trier of fact\'s province to weigh the evidence and
assess witness credibility, a finding that a defendant was not insane at
the time of the offense warrants substantial deference from reviewing
courts. *See* *Barany,* 658 N.E.2d at 63. A defendant claiming the
insanity defense should have prevailed at trial faces a heavy burden
because he or she \"is in the position of one appealing from a negative
judgment.\" *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at 1149. A court on review will not
reweigh evidence, reassess witness credibility, or disturb reasonable
inferences made by the trier of fact (even though \"more reasonable\"
inferences could have been made). *Id.* at 1149-50.

Although this standard of review is deferential, it is not impossible,
nor can it be. The Indiana Constitution guarantees \"in all cases an
absolute right to one appeal.\" Ind. Const. art. VII, § 6. An impossible
standard of review under which appellate courts merely \"rubber stamp\"
the fact finder\'s determinations, no matter how unreasonable, would
raise serious constitutional concerns because it would make the right to
an appeal illusory. *Cf.* *Serino v. State,* 798 N.E.2d 852, 856
(Ind.2003) (standard of review for sentencing claims so high that it
risked impinging upon the \[710\] constitutional right to appeal). As
such, this Court has long held that where the defendant claims the
insanity defense should have prevailed, the conviction will be set aside
\"when the evidence is *without conflict* and leads only to the
conclusion that the defendant was insane when the crime was committed.\"
*Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at 1149 (emphasis added); *see also* *Barany,*
658 N.E.2d at 63-64 (citation omitted).

## II

We have on several occasions addressed a defendant\'s claim that his or
her insanity defense should have prevailed at trial because of
nonconflicting expert testimony that the defendant was insane at the
time of the crime. Each time we have upheld the conviction(s) because
the evidence as to the defendant\'s insanity was in conflict and thus
sufficient to sustain the trier of fact\'s determination of sanity.
*See, e.g.,* *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d 1146; *Gambill v. State,* 675 N.E.2d
668 (Ind.1996); *Barany,* 658 N.E.2d 60; *Cate,* 644 N.E.2d 546; *Rogers
v. State,* 514 N.E.2d 1259 (Ind. 1987); *Green v. State,* 469 N.E.2d
1169 (Ind.1984). That is, in each of the cases where there has been
nonconflicting expert opinion testimony that a defendant was insane,
there has been other sufficient probative evidence from which a
conflicting inference of sanity reasonably could be drawn. *See*
*Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at 1152 (Sullivan, J., concurring).

## A

The strongest showing of an evidentiary conflict occurs where the
experts disagree as to whether the defendant was insane at the time of
the offense. Our cases have consistently held that conflicting credible
expert testimony is sufficiently probative of sanity. *See, e.g.,*
*Robinette v. State,* 741 N.E.2d 1162, 1167 (Ind.2001); *Weeks,* 697
N.E.2d at 29; *Metzler v. State,* 540 N.E.2d 606, 610 (Ind.1989); *Smith
v. State,* 502 N.E.2d 485, 490 (Ind.1987); *Reed v. State,* 479 N.E.2d
1248, 1253 (Ind.1985). Such a conflict arises where one or several
experts opine that the defendant was insane at the time of the offense,
while one or several other experts opine that the defendant was sane at
the time of the offense.

## A-1

A conflict does not exist, however, where one or several experts testify
that the defendant was insane at the time of the offense and another
expert testifies that he or she is unable to give an opinion as to the
defendant\'s sanity at the time of the offense.

In *Green,* three of four experts testified that the defendant was
insane at the time of the crime. 469 N.E.2d at 1172. The fourth expert
testified that the defendant met only one of the requirements of
insanity under then-applicable law, but he could not form an opinion as
to the second. *Id.* Even though there was no actual conflict in the
expert testimony, we affirmed the conviction because the \"other
evidence\" presented to the jury was sufficient to support its finding
that the defendant was sane at the time of the
crime.[^\[11\]^](#X17ac04e5c335697bd4fae89442794cb2e9a18e4) *Id.*
Similarly, in *Rogers,* the court-appointed expert \[711\] testified
that the defendant was insane at the time of the crime, while the
defendant\'s expert testified that he could not render an opinion on the
matter. 514 N.E.2d at 1261. Although there was no actual conflict in the
experts\' testimony, this Court once again affirmed the conviction based
on the conflict presented by the lay testimony. *Id.* The Court cited
*Green* for the proposition that a jury may reject expert testimony of
insanity and rely upon lay testimony that the defendant was sane at the
time of the crime. *Id.* Like *Green,* the conflicting evidence that
provided sufficient grounds for the jury\'s finding of sanity was based
on a conflict between lay testimony and expert testimony, not a conflict
between experts.[^\[12\]^](#X4e19b1ab982e4dad06880bfa5ebf547c457f561)
*Id.*

Moreover, as a matter of law, a person is either sane or insane at the
time of the crime; there is no intermediate ground. *Marley v. State,*
747 N.E.2d 1123, 1128 (Ind.2001) (quoting *Cowell v. State,* 263 Ind.
344, 331 N.E.2d 21, 24 (1975) (providing that \"complete mental
incapacity must be demonstrated before criminal responsibility can be
relieved\")). The trier of fact therefore has one of only two options
with regard to insanity. And its decision must be based on probative
evidence, which means \"\[e\]vidence that tends to prove or disprove a
point in issue.\" *Black\'s Law Dictionary* 639 (9th ed.2009). An expert
witness who is called to testify as to his or her opinion, in an effort
to aid the trier of fact, and who testifies that he or she has no
opinion does not provide probative evidence.

## A-2

The expert testimony in this case did not conflict. Although Dr.
Davidson submitted a preliminary report opining that the defendant was
sane at the time of the murder, he recanted that opinion under
cross-examination in light of learning critical facts. The State
contends that Dr. Davidson\'s equivocation illustrates that the expert
testimony was in conflict. We disagree.

First, the State\'s argument is not consistent with our prior cases.
Both *Green* and *Rogers* involved an expert who was unable to form an
opinion as to the defendant\'s sanity. We affirmed the convictions in
both cases only because there was conflicting lay evidence. Under the
State\'s view that no opinion represents a conflicting opinion, both
*Green* and *Rogers* could have been affirmed without a discussion of
the lay evidence, given our consistent holdings as to the value and
sufficiency of conflicting expert testimony.

Second, the trial court\'s findings preclude the possibility of a true
conflict in the expert testimony because it did not give any weight to
the expert testimony in this case. Rather, the trial court focused its
analysis on demeanor evidence to support its finding that the defendant
was guilty but mentally ill. It mentions the experts only once, as a
preface to its finding that the defendant meets the definition of
\"mentally ill,\" and merely states that \"\[e\]ach of the examining
doctors . . . were divided on the issue of insanity.\" Appellant\'s App.
258. Given the consistent holdings of this Court with respect to the
strength of conflicting expert testimony in sustaining a finding of
sanity, and given the trial court\'s analysis in this case, the trial
court clearly did not make a finding that the expert testimony was in
conflict. Thus, the experts\' testimony about the defendant\'s \[712\]
insanity at the time of the crime did not conflict.

## B

Where there is no conflict among the expert opinions that the defendant
was insane at the time of the offense, there must be other evidence of
probative value from which a conflicting inference of sanity can be
drawn. *See* *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at 1152 (Sullivan, J., concurring).
Such probative evidence is usually in the form of lay opinion testimony
that conflicts with the experts or demeanor evidence that, when
considered in light of the other evidence, permits a reasonable
inference of sanity to be drawn.

## B-1

In many cases, there will be lay opinion testimony that the defendant
was sane at the time of the crime. Credible and informed lay opinion
testimony as to the defendant\'s mental state at the time of the crime
may be sufficiently probative to support a trier of fact\'s
determination of sanity, even where there is unanimous expert testimony
to the contrary. *See, e.g.,* *Barany,* 658 N.E.2d at 64; *Green,* 469
N.E.2d at 1172. Lay witnesses who are familiar with and observe the
defendant at or around the time of the crime reasonably may be able to
give a more accurate account of the defendant\'s mental state at the
time of the crime than experts who examine the defendant months later.
*See* *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at 1149.

For instance, in *Gambill,* we affirmed the conviction of a mother
convicted of murdering her son because there was lay opinion testimony
that conflicted with the unanimous expert testimony. 675 N.E.2d 668. One
of the officers who spent time with the defendant at the hospital in the
immediate aftermath of her arrest had attended high school with the
defendant, and based on his familiarity with her and his observations of
her on the day of the murder, he testified that, in his lay opinion, she
was able to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct at the time of
the crime. *Id.* at 672; *see also* *Green,* 469 N.E.2d at 1172. A
jail-house informant with whom the defendant discussed the murder also
testified that she believed the defendant was able to appreciate the
wrongfulness of her conduct at the time of the murder. *Gambill,* 675
N.E.2d at 671-72. Additionally, the defendant made several self-serving
exculpatory statements during the immediate aftermath of the murder ---
namely, she did not tell medical personnel of her heavy drug use that
day, and she told a motorist who gave her a ride that she had been raped
and that her former boyfriend had hurt her son. *Id.* at 672-73.

## B-2

Even where there is no conflict among the experts and the lay witnesses,
a finding that a defendant was sane at the time of the crime still may
be sustained by probative demeanor evidence from which a conflicting
inference of sanity may be drawn. *See* *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d at 1149.
We have recognized the importance of demeanor evidence in insanity
cases. Demeanor is useful because a defendant\'s \"behavior before,
during, and after a crime may be more indicative of actual mental health
at \[the\] time of the crime than mental exams conducted weeks or months
later.\" *Id.* (citing *Barany,* 658 N.E.2d at 64).

Demeanor evidence may be most useful where there is some indication that
the defendant is feigning mental illness and insanity. *E.g.,*
*Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d 1146; *Cate,* 644 N.E.2d 546. In *Thompson,* we
affirmed the defendant\'s conviction for residential entry because there
was sufficient evidence of probative value to \[713\] sustain the trial
court\'s finding that the defendant was not insane at the time of the
crime. 804 N.E.2d at 1150. For instance, the defendant removed only her
possessions once she entered the victim\'s residence, which reasonably
suggested that she was aware that it was wrong to take things that did
not belong to her. *Id.* at 1148. Moreover, as she fled from the scene
of the crime, she was stopped momentarily by police but allowed to
leave, which reasonably suggested that she was sufficiently lucid to
continue about her business. *Id.* Thompson had also recently been
discharged from the hospital with \"no active psychotic symptoms . . .
and was calm and pleasant without agitation.\" *Id.* at 1150. Finally,
Thompson had a history of lying and \"avoiding criminal responsibility
through her illness.\" *Id.* Based on all of the probative evidence, the
trial judge concluded that Thompson \"knew her actions were wrong but
was using her illness to manipulate the system.\" *Id.;* see also Cate,
644 N.E.2d at 547-48 (affirming the defendant\'s conviction because of
inconsistencies in his story, which suggested feigning, and because
there was probative demeanor evidence of defendant\'s lucidity upon
arrest).

To be sure, demeanor evidence may be appropriate in cases where there is
no evidence of feigning. For instance, the defendant in *Barany* was
found by all three experts to have been legally insane at the time of
the crime, but we affirmed his murder conviction because there was
conflicting evidence of sanity given by lay witnesses. 658 N.E.2d at 64.
Specifically, an investigating police detective testified that the
defendant \"talked about the victim\'s complaints and nagging\" only a
few hours after the crime. *Id.* Additionally, one of the defendant\'s
friends testified that although the defendant engaged in unusual topics
of conversation, he \"seemed O.K.\" *Id.* Finally, the defendant told
his sister that he believed the victim was calling the police when he
killed her. *Id.* We concluded that \"\[t\]he jury could have decided
that this testimony about \[the defendant\'s\] behavior was more
indicative of his actual mental health at the time of the killing than
medical examinations conducted four weeks after the arrest.\" *Id.*

Although demeanor evidence often is useful, there are limits to its
probative value. First, demeanor evidence is of more limited value when
the defendant has a long history of mental illness with psychosis. As
the Court of Appeals previously explained:

> While the jury is the ultimate finder of fact, we fail to see how
> evidence of a defendant\'s demeanor before and after a crime can have
> much probative value when a schizophrenic defendant is involved.. ..
>
> . . . .
>
> The proposition that a jury may infer that a person\'s actions before
> and after a crime are \"indicative of his actual mental health at the
> time of the\" crime is logical when dealing with a defendant who is
> not prone to delusional or hallucinogenic episodes. However, when a
> defendant has a serious and well-documented mental disorder, such as

*Moler v. State,* 782 N.E.2d 454, 458-59 (Ind.Ct.App.2003), *trans.
denied,* 792 N.E.2d 43 (Ind.2003) (table). Demeanor evidence requires
the trier of fact to infer what the defendant was thinking based on his
or her conduct. The trier of fact uses its common knowledge of what is
normal and what is abnormal to make these inferences. But insanity is
not limited to the stereotypical view of a \"raging lunatic\" --- a
\[714\] person experiencing a psychotic delusion may appear normal to
passersby.

Second, Indiana\'s insanity test is a purely cognitive test --- it asks
only what the defendant was thinking and whether he or she could
appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct. At one time, Indiana
included, as a second basis for insanity, whether a defendant had the
capacity to conform his or her conduct to the law --- i.e., the
irresistible impulse test. *Green,* 469 N.E.2d at 1171 (citing Ind.Code
§ 35-41-3-6(a) (Burns 1979)). This volitional component was removed from
the statute in 1984. *See* Act of Feb. 24, 1984, No. 184, § 1, 1984 Ind.
Acts 1501, 1501. Demeanor evidence thus had more probative value to
negate a defense of insane conduct because of the volitional component
of the insanity test. *See, e.g.,* *Taylor,* 440 N.E.2d 1109.

Finally, demeanor evidence before and after a crime is of more limited
value than the defendant\'s demeanor during the crime. The insanity
defense concerns the defendant\'s mental state at the time of the crime.
As such, Indiana law recognizes the defense of \"temporary insanity.\"
*Gambill,* 675 N.E.2d at 674-75; *Flowers v. State,* 236 Ind. 151, 139
N.E.2d 185, 196 (1956). The law thus allows for the possibility that a
defendant will be legally insane at the time of the crime, but compos
mentis immediately before and immediately after the crime. Therefore, a
defendant\'s demeanor before and after a crime may be even less
indicative of the defendant\'s mental state during the crime than
demeanor evidence normally is.

Thus, as a general rule, demeanor evidence must be considered as a
whole, in relation to all the other evidence. To allow otherwise would
give carte blanche to the trier of fact and make appellate review
virtually impossible. For instance, in *Thompson* and *Gambill,* the
trial courts found that the defendant\'s flight from police was
probative of sanity. But in *Lyon v. State,* the fact that the defendant
did not flee but rather waited for police in the next room was probative
of sanity. 608 N.E.2d 1368, 1369-70 (Ind.1993). If a piece of demeanor
evidence standing alone is considered probative, evidence of the
defendant\'s actions after the crime could be used as the sole basis for
a finding of sanity, whether the defendant cooperated with police or
not.

## C

In this case, there was not sufficient evidence of probative value from
which an inference of sanity could be drawn sufficient to create a
conflict with the (nonconflicting) expert testimony that the defendant
was insane at the time of the offense. First, there was no lay opinion
testimony given that conflicted with the experts\' opinions that the
defendant was insane at the time of the stabbing. The three eyewitnesses
to the stabbing called by the State testified that the defendant was
showing familiar signs of \"losing it.\" The defendant\'s aunt, who was
sitting on the couch as her mother was stabbed only a few feet away,
testified that the defendant had a \"wild look\" in his eye and that she
recognized this as the look he gets right before he loses it. She also
heard the defendant call his beloved grandmother the devil as he stabbed
her. Two other witnesses --- the defendant\'s mother and the
defendant\'s friend --- also testified that the defendant was showing
signs of losing it in the days and hours leading up to the murder. Thus,
unlike *Thompson,* where there was no lay opinion evidence on the issue
of insanity, there were five lay witnesses in this case whose testimony
supports the experts\' opinions.

Second, there was not sufficient demeanor evidence of probative value
from which \[715\] an inference of sanity could be drawn. The trial
court based its findings on very little evidence. It found as probative
of sanity the fact that, over the course of an hour, the defendant
shopped, ate, and filled a car with gasoline without incident. It also
found as probative the fact that the defendant cooperated with police
after the fact. Viewed in isolation, each of these events may indeed
represent the normal events of daily life. However, when viewed against
the defendant\'s long history of mental illness with psychotic episodes,
the defendant\'s demeanor during the crime, as testified to by three
eyewitnesses, and the absence of any suggestions of feigning or
malingering, this demeanor evidence is simply neutral and not probative
of sanity.

Additionally, we are unable to agree with the trial court\'s conclusions
that certain facts were probative of sanity. Two investigating officers
testified that there was absolutely no evidence of a plan or motive. In
light of this, the trial court found as probative of sanity the fact
that the defendant, without any warning, stabbed his grandmother, his
best friend with whom he had lived for seven years, in front of three
family members while calling her the devil. We see nothing connecting
the absence of plan or motive and the defendant acting without warning
as he did as probative of sanity.

The trial court also found as probative of sanity the fact that the
defendant deteriorated during trial to the point that he was deemed
legally incompetent and was committed to a state hospital to regain
competence. We do not find the defendant\'s deteriorating to
incompetence to stand trial to be probative of his sanity at the time of
the offense.

The trial court expressly found that the defendant deteriorates mentally
and experiences psychosis when he does not take his medication. At the
time of the stabbing, the defendant was supposed to be taking his
medications twice a day. He told police, however, that he had not taken
any prescription medication in two days. The trial court found this
failure to take medication to be probative of sanity, but we do not,
especially in light of the trial court\'s finding that the defendant
became psychotic when not on his medication.

The trial court also relied on the defendant\'s demeanor during trial,
when he was competent to stand trial, as probative of his sanity at the
time of the crime. As discussed at length *supra,* a defendant\'s
demeanor during court proceedings is certainly probative of sanity with
regard to his or her competence to stand trial. *See* *Manuel v. State,*
535 N.E.2d 1159, 1162 (Ind.1989) (per curiam). But the probative value
of a defendant\'s courtroom demeanor during trial as to his or her
mental state at the time of the crime is doubtful. The justification for
considering a defendant\'s demeanor before and after the crime is that
conduct occurring in temporal proximity to the crime \"may be more
indicative of actual mental health at \[the\] time of the crime than
mental exams conducted weeks or months later.\" *Thompson,* 804 N.E.2d
at 1149. Trial proceedings, however, often occur many months or even
years after the crime. In this case, the two-day bench trial occurred
nearly a year after the murder. Thus, we do not find the fact that the
defendant \"was alert and oriented throughout the proceedings and
assisted his counsel and the investigator\" to be probative of his
sanity at the time of the crime.

Finally, unlike *Thompson* and *Cate,* where there were suggestions of
feigning or malingering, there is no evidence or suggestion that the
defendant here feigned \[716\] his mental illness. The trial court
expressly found as much with regard to defendant\'s long history of
mental illness.

## III

Because the insanity defense relieves a defendant of criminal
responsibility, even where it is established beyond a reasonable doubt
that he or she committed the criminal act, there is an inherent risk of
abuse. We are mindful of these risks, which is why substantial deference
is given to the trier of fact\'s finding of sanity. The trier of fact is
in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to
observe the defendant over a period of time. Accordingly, whether a
defendant is malingering or feigning mental illness or insanity is
clearly an appropriate consideration for the trier of fact. *See* Part
II.B, *supra.*

It was not appropriate, however, for the trier of fact to consider the
condition of our State\'s mental health system. Although raising the
insanity defense opens the door to examining the defendant\'s entire
life and allows in evidence that might otherwise be inadmissible under
our rules of evidence, *see* *Garner v. State,* 704 N.E.2d 1011, 1014
(Ind.1998), what may or may not happen to the defendant in the future
cannot be considered. The trier of fact must make its determination as
to whether the defendant was insane at the time of the offense using
only evidence and considerations that are
relevant[^\[13\]^](#X86d3dd5ee1f9179ae38263d47aac3eb55378b92) to the
defendant\'s mental state at the time of the offense.

The insanity defense may not be a constitutional mandate, *see* *Clark
v. Arizona,* 548 U.S. 735, 748-49, 126 S.Ct. 2709, 165 L.Ed.2d 842
(2006), but it dates back to the twelfth century, *see* Francis Bowes
Sayre, *Mens Rea,* 45 Harv. L.Rev. 974 (1932). Prior to the twelfth
century, criminal law was based on principles of strict liability ---
the only inquiry was whether the criminal defendant committed the
criminal act. *See* Sayre, *supra,* at 977. Toward the end of the
twelfth century, the influences of ancient Roman law and canon law began
to call into question the morality of punishing someone for a criminal
act committed without criminal intent. *See id.* at 982-84. Insanity,
like self-defense, thus became a basis for a royal pardon wherein the
insane defendant was convicted of the charged offense but pardoned by
the King. *See id.* at 1004-05.

Over the centuries, insanity became a defense to criminal
responsibility. *See, e.g.,* 4 William Blackstone, *Commentaries on the
Laws of England* 24-25 (1769). Arguably the most clear and influential
statement of the insanity defense came from the House of Lords in
*M\'Naghten\'s Case,* (1843) 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (H.L.). It was there held
that the common law test for insanity had been and was \"whether the
accused at the time of doing the act knew the difference between right
and wrong.\" *Id.* at 722. That is, a defendant was not criminally
responsible if, at the time of the offense, he was unable to appreciate
the wrongfulness of his conduct.

The insanity defense has undergone many changes since the mid-nineteenth
century. One of the most significant was the development of the
irresistible impulse test, which recognized volitional impairment as a
basis for the insanity defense, and the subsequent expansion of both the
cognitive and volitional tests embodied in the Model Penal Code. *See*
Christopher Slobogin, *An End to Insanity: Recasting* \[717\] *the Role
of Mental Disability in Criminal Cases,* 86 Va. L.Rev. 1199, 1211-12
(2000). Although many states, including Indiana, adopted some variation
of the broader insanity defense during the 1960s and 1970s, most states
repealed the volitional test after John Hinckley was found not guilty by
reason of insanity for the attempted assassination of President Ronald
Reagan in the early 1980s. *See id.* at 1214. Since then, many states,
like Indiana, have reverted back to the original common law insanity
test described in *M\'Naghten. Id.* In fact, several states have
abolished the insanity defense completely. *See, e.g.,* Idaho Code Ann.
§ 18-207 (2004); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 22-3220 (2007); Mont.Code Ann. §
46-14-102 (2009).[^\[14\]^](#X4f8ce0a17945383e8beed261cd3d8afc43ec7db)

The Indiana General Assembly has chosen to return to our common law
roots and hold criminally responsible only those defendants who are
morally responsible for their actions. Judges must apply that law and
find not responsible by reason of insanity those defendants who
establish each component of the insanity defense by a preponderance of
the evidence. It is not for the judicial branch to decide that a legally
insane defendant should be convicted and sentenced to prison because of
the condition of the State\'s mental health system.

The trial court erred in this case by entering a verdict of guilty but
mentally ill when the evidence presented reasonably led only to a
conclusion that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the
offense. Underlying the trial court\'s decision was not a concern of
malingering or feigning but a concern about the State\'s mental health
system and the defendant\'s need for structure and constant supervision.
Among the trial court\'s findings is that the defendant \"lacks in-sight
into the need for his prescribed medication\" and \"is in need of long
term stabilizing treatment in a secure facility.\" The trial court also
found that the defendant \"repeatedly discontinued medication\" and
there was \"no evidence that this pattern of conduct will not continue
if \[the defendant\] is hospitalized and released, posing a danger to
himself and others in the community.\"

Though made after the verdict, the trial court\'s statements at
sentencing cast light on the rationale underlying the
verdict.[^\[15\]^](#Xb9b23d9390a077c48e58fab9ceac015fe462e3e) The trial
court confessed at sentencing that it viewed \"\[t\]his case . . . as
much a trial of our mental health system as . . . of a man.\" The court
lamented that it could not simply commit the defendant to a mental
health institution for the rest of his life --- the \"easy\" decision.
What made the court\'s decision so difficult was that it could not \"in
good conscience allow someone with . . . severe mental illness to return
to the community.\"

To be sure, the trial court was not unreasonable in finding that the
defendant\'s history of mental illness, his lack of insight into the
need for medication, and his track record of mentally deteriorating
after stopping his medication creates a high probability that the
defendant will be a danger to himself and to others in the community if
treated and released. Although such considerations may be relevant and
appropriate during a commitment proceeding, \[718\] they are not
relevant or appropriate in determining whether the defendant was legally
insane at the time of the offense. Thus, while we sympathize with the
difficulty of the trial court\'s decision, we cannot sustain it.

## Conclusion

We reverse the judgment of the trial court.

RUCKER and DAVID, JJ., concur.

SHEPARD, C.J., dissents with separate opinion in which DICKSON, J.,
joins.

SHEPARD, Chief Justice, dissenting.

Gregory Galloway is someone who went shopping at a going-out-of-business
sale in the morning, had some lunch at a local restaurant with his aunt
and grandmother, and stopped off at a gas station to buy fuel and
cigarettes. Galloway appeared normal all day; \"everybody was happy,\"
one of his companions said.

When Galloway arrived home, he stabbed his grandmother to death, and
then immediately announced that he regretted what he had done. The
finder of fact in this case, Judge Mary Willis, concluded on the basis
of the admitted evidence that Galloway was not insane at the time of the
crime, that is to say, that he knew killing his grandmother was wrong.

Of course, all of the testimony by psychiatrists and psychologists
necessarily came from witnesses who were not present at the scene of the
crime. They offered their observations based on records of Galloway\'s
medical history from moments other than the hour of the killing and on
direct observations of Galloway that occurred months or even years after
the crime. One of these experts, Dr. Glenn Davidson, appointed by the
court, concluded that Galloway was not insane at the time of the crime.
Eyewitness evidence about how Galloway acted before and after the crime
also supported the trial court\'s decision.

This was one of those cases where the defense argued that the
perpetrator was sane right before the crime and sane right after the
crime, but insane for the sixty seconds or so it took to commit it. Dr.
Davidson\'s basic view was that it was unlikely that Galloway qualified
as insane on the basis of a \"very thin slice of disorganized
thinking.\" (Tr. at 228.)

Defense counsel\'s vigorous cross-examination confronted Dr. Davidson
with a host of hypotheticals (\"now what if I told you\") and asked as
to each new proposed fact whether it would affect his diagnosis. It was
twenty to thirty pages of the sort of energetic cross-examination
tactics to which we lawyers are inured but which often befuddle the
uninitiated. It finally left the witness saying, in the face of this
onslaught, that he was unsure.

As the majority points out, juries and judicial factfinders are not
required to take as completely true all or none of what witnesses say.
They are entitled to believe and disbelieve some, all, or none of the
testimony of experts and non-experts alike. Indeed, their assignment is
to sort out truth from cacophony. It was altogether plausible that Judge
Willis could credit Dr. Davidson\'s opinion that Galloway was sane and
treat the doctor\'s answers under cross as less compelling. She could
also, of course, give weight to Galloway\'s own contemporaneous
declaration of regret right after he killed his grandmother.

To be sure, if the right of appeal is to be meaningful, both trial and
appellate judges must be open to the possibility of mistake. We set a
pretty tough standard for trial judges as to casting aside jury
verdicts, for example, saying that they may do only when the jury\'s
verdict is \"against the weight of the evidence\" or \"clearly
erroneous.\" \[719\] Ind. Trial Rule 59(J). Our rules require that the
judge who sets aside a jury verdict explain in detail, if you will, why
the judge is better at weighing the evidence than the members of the
jury. The appellate standard is roughly the same, and appellate judges
regularly declare that we who have not even seen the witnesses or the
defendant should be extremely restrained when we contemplate announcing
that our assessment of the weight of the evidence is superior to that of
juries or judges who have seen both.

It seems straightforward enough that Dr. Davidson\'s testimony and the
defendant\'s own demeanor at the time of the offense support Judge
Willis\'s judgment. Thus, the appellate standard for reversal has not
been met. *Thompson v. State,* 804 N.E.2d 1146, 1149 (Ind.2004)
(\"evidence is without conflict and leads only to the conclusion the
defendant was insane.\")

The majority declares that it is not relevant what may happen as a
result of this reversal by appellate judges. Not many of our fellow
citizens would not recognize this disclaimer of responsibility as
legitimate.

As the majority does acknowledge, there is risk involved when appellate
judges second-guess a jury or trial judge and acquit a criminal
offender. If Galloway is declared not guilty by this Court, the
prosecutor will initiate a civil commitment process to determine whether
Galloway should be confined because his mental illness makes him a
danger to himself or to others.

The one thing we know for sure about Mr. Galloway is that he is in
actual fact a danger to others.

We also know what is likely to occur as a result of this Court setting
aside Judge Willis\'s judgment: sooner or later, probably sooner rather
than later, Galloway will be determined safe and turned back into
society.

The reason we know that is that the civil commitment process has
produced such an outcome over and over again with Mr. Galloway. The
majority has recited the long trail of medical treatments and mental
commitments. It has not focused much in that recitation on how the
exercise of expert medical judgments and the civil commitment processes
have combined to turn him back out on the street over and over again.

I count perhaps seventeen identifiable encounters by Galloway. But just
to name a few, call it number 5, there was a May 1999 event in which
Galloway\'s wife brought him in because he had been carrying around a
gun and threatening to use it on his supervisor at work. This trip
produced a prescription for medication and a period of outpatient
treatment, then a failure to take his medications and a medical trail
gone cold.

During encounter number 7, in April 2001, Galloway was admitted to the
hospital because of aggressive and frightening behavior at home. He said
he had been receiving messages from the television. This interaction
with the system produced several months of monitoring during which
Galloway took some of his medicines and not others. And then he was out.

During encounter number 8, Galloway was involuntarily committed because
he had threatened to kill his neighbor and his grandmother. He was
released from commitment and then admitted again just a month later, in
March 2002. He stayed a few months at Richmond State Hospital before
being declared safe for release.

In encounter number 13, not long before Galloway killed his grandmother,
Galloway came under care after he stopped taking his medicines and began
reporting hallucinations \[720\] and recurring thoughts of suicide.
After being stabilized, he was discharged to live with his grandmother,
with a result plain and painful for all to see.

I mention this litany---just salient elements in an even longer
story---to suggest that some innocent future victim is placed at risk by
this Court\'s decision to second-guess Judge Willis. A society that
responds to such violence with tolerance should well expect that it will
experience more violence than it would if it finally said, \"This is
unacceptable.\" Not knowing what I would say to the next victim, I
choose to stand with Judge Willis and affirm the judgment of guilty but
mentally ill.

## DISCUSSION

On November 1, 1995, defendant provided notice to the government,
pursuant to Rule 12.2, of his intent to rely on a defense of temporary
insanity and to introduce expert testimony to negate the *mens rea*
element of the offense of aircraft
piracy.[^\[2\]^](#Xa55396dd737044cfc3293a6f023cbe319c498cc) On the same
day, defense counsel also notified the government that defendant had
been evaluated by three expert psychologists --- Drs. Nuha Abudabbeh,
John Wilson, and Harvey Dondershine --- as part of the preparation of
defendant\'s insanity defense. All three experts conducted psychological
testing on defendant, and diagnosed the defendant as suffering from post
traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"). Defendant provided the reports to
the government and, shortly thereafter, the government filed the present
motion *in limine* to preclude defendant from introducing lay and expert
evidence related to the insanity defense, and requested a pretrial
hearing to determine the admissibility and scope of the evidence that
defendant intends to introduce in support of his insanity defense. **\[
... \]**

Defendant\'s insanity defense is based on a claim that defendant, at the
time of the offense, suffered from PTSD. According to the government,
lay and expert evidence of defendant\'s **\[ ... \]**PTSD diagnosis is
irrelevant to an insanity defense because defendant\'s case of PTSD is
not of sufficient severity to constitute an affirmative defense of
insanity under 18 U.S.C. § 17(a). The government also contends that,
even if defendant\'s evidence were relevant to a viable insanity
defense, such evidence should nevertheless be precluded by the court
because it has a strong tendency to either confuse the issues or mislead
the jury.

The affirmative defense of insanity is set forth in 18 U.S.C. §
17(a).[^\[5\]^](#Xebc047638b27ed08d8f809baf528e7688c91908) The
requirements of section 17(a) are clear: unless the mental condition
claimed by defendant was \"severe\" and resulted in the inability of
defendant to \"appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his
acts,\" the \"\[m\]ental disease or defect does not \... constitute \[an
affirmative\] defense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 17(a). Thus, the relevance of the
evidence pertaining to defendant\'s PTSD diagnosis turns on whether
defendant\'s case of PTSD is of sufficient severity to constitute an
affirmative defense of
insanity.[^\[6\]^](#Xba1ef1e1962bedd37eab51dde5146f0f384cbd7)

Courts have generally taken a liberal approach to the admissibility of
evidence in support or contradiction of the affirmative defense of
insanity. **\[ ... \]**

The three reports by defendant\'s experts, when reviewed as a whole,
clearly indicate that defendant\'s diagnosis of PTSD meets the test of
insanity as set out in 18 U.S.C. §
17(a).[^\[7\]^](#Xd34fb874695712385c7de463d6c0a407305b589) Dr.
Dondershine\'s report concluded that defendant suffered from what can
only be described as a severe case of PTSD and depression that
\"seriously impaired\" his ability to judge the wrongfulness of his
conduct. According to Dr. Dondershine, at the time of the hijacking,
defendant\'s \"personality was fragmenting and the parts --- perception,
reason, judgment, contemplation of right and wrong, and assessment of
consequences --- were no longer fully
\[operative\].\"[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xc132c80825a131fd2a8c3bffe969fc62dd1182c)Similarly,
Dr. Wilson concluded that, at the time of the offense,**\[ ...
\]**defendant \"suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major
Depression,\" and as a result of this illness, \"was unable to
appreciate \[the\] wrongfulness of his conduct.\" **\[ ... \]**He also
described defendant\'s mental state at the time of the hijacking as
\"fragile, vulnerable, and unstable.\" **\[ ... \]**

Dr. Abudabbeh diagnosed defendant\'s PTSD as less severe than the
others. Although Dr. Abudabbeh concluded in the report that **\[ ...
\]** Mr. Rezaq did suffer from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Chronic,\"
and that \"as a result of his mental illness, Mr. Rezaq was unable to
appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts\....\" **\[ ... \]**,
conspicuously absent from Dr. Abudabbeh\'s report is the kind of
description of defendant\'s condition that would indicate that defendant
case of PTSD and depression was indeed severe. Nevertheless, these three
reports, when reviewed as a whole, indicate that defendant\'s case of
PTSD meets the test of insanity as set out in 18 U.S.C. § 17(a).
Accordingly, defendant\'s expert evidence cannot be excluded on
relevancy grounds.

The government also maintains that, even if the evidence is relevant to
defendant\'s insanity defense, it should nevertheless be precluded by
the court because its \"probative value is substantially outweighed by
the danger of \... confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"
Fed.R.Evid. 403. The government, however, provides no support for this
contention. Rather, the government merely recites a concern raised by
Congress when it passed the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 that
psychiatric testimony, in certain instances, may be needlessly
confusing. **\[ ... \]** The government, however, has not asserted that
the psychiatric evidence *in this case* is either needlessly confusing
or has the potential to mislead the jury. The court therefore finds that
the probative value of defendant\'s expert testimony in support of his
insanity defense is not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair
prejudice. Accordingly, the court shall deny the part of the
government\'s motion *in limine* that seeks to preclude the defendant
from introducing lay and expert testimony, pursuant to Rule 12.2(a), in
support of his insanity defense.

State v. Bottrell

 

14 P.3d 164 (2000)\
103 Wash.App. 706

## STATE of Washington, Respondent, v. Teresa Ann BOTTRELL, Appellant.

No. 23757-1-II.

Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 2.

December 15, 2000.

**\[ ... \]**

## BRIDGEWATER, J.

**\[ ... \]**

## FACTS

In late 1997 and early 1998, Teresa Bottrell was incarcerated in the
Clark County Jail for a forgery conviction. While in jail, Bottrell
learned that John Hall, a person much older than she who was not
incarcerated, was willing to deposit money in female inmates\' jail
accounts in exchange for telephonic sexual conversation. Bottrell needed
money, so she called Hall from the jail and spoke with him several
times. Hall visited her at the jail and she obtained probation
permission to live at his house upon her release. Hall hoped to get
sexual favors from Bottrell. Upon her release, she visited Hall at his
home several times.

On the night of Hall\'s murder, Bottrell went to Hall\'s house. Bottrell
testified that she went there to get money from Hall by having sex with
him. She and Hall talked about what he wanted before Hall went into the
bedroom.

According to Bottrell, Hall asked her to tie him up and put tape over
his mouth. She took a roll of duct tape and went into the bedroom. Hall
was lying on the bed, propped up against a pillow. She tore off some of
the tape, then changed her mind, told him no, and threw down the tape.
Hall hit her in the face and they began to fight. During the struggle,
Bottrell hit Hall with a lacquered wooden ornamental duck and a clock
radio. While Hall was on the floor, Bottrell got up, grabbed a pair of
scissors, and cut a piece of the phone cord. Hall asked Bottrell for
help and then he grabbed her again. So, she \"tried to tie his hands
\[with the cord\], but \... got it around his neck\" instead. **\[ ...
\]**

Bottrell next remembers standing against the wall looking down at Hall,
touching him with her foot and noticing that he did not move. She
testified that at that point, she realized Hall was dead. She also
testified that during the struggle with Hall she thought about past
events in her life. She thought about an incident where her mother tried
to run over her father with the car. She thought about her father\'s
alcoholism and him beating her as a child. Bottrell thought about a man
who had almost killed her when she was hitchhiking.

When she realized Hall was dead, Bottrell attempted to clean up and
cover up by changing her clothing and starting a load of laundry. She
tried to burn a towel, setting off the smoke alarm. Then she went into
the bedroom, got Hall\'s safe out, and rifled through it looking for
money. She and her boyfriend, Larry Jones, later returned looking for
money. They stole Hall\'s keys and his Lincoln Continental.

Bottrell acknowledged that **\[ ... \]**the night of the homicide, she
went to Hall\'s house planning to get money from him. Sometime before
the night of the homicide and while still incarcerated, Bottrell told a
fellow inmate that she would take Hall for everything he had, including
his Lincoln Continental, Jeep, tools, and checkbook. She previously told
another inmate**\[ ... \]** that: she would marry Hall; because he was
old and on insulin, it would not take long for him to die; and if he had
an overdose of insulin, he would die and everything would be hers.
Although Bottrell claimed initially to have planned to exchange sex with
Hall for money, she testified that she stole two of Hall\'s checks the
day before his death and gave them to Jones, **\[ ... \]**who tried to
forge and to cash them. After Hall\'s death, while incarcerated in the
Portland jail, Bottrell told yet another inmate that: she had gone over
to Hall\'s house planning to take money and \"stuff\" which prompted
Hall to call the police and precipitated the fight; she was glad she had
killed him; and she was going to claim that she killed him because he
was a child molester.

Bottrell was charged by an amended information with one count of first
degree premeditated murder and one count of first degree felony murder,
with a predicate crime of robbery. The jury returned a verdict of guilty
of the lesser included offense of second degree murder on count one and
first degree felony murder on count
two.[^\[2\]^](#Xd2ecd5b8fd13945d4083c106c39f2c502c28afc)

## I. MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE

**\[ ... \]**

Dr. Stanulis

**\[ ... \]**

\"Diminished capacity is a mental condition not amounting to insanity
which prevents the defendant from possessing the requisite mental state
necessary to commit the crime charged.\" ***\[ ... \]*** Here, part of
Bottrell\'s defense was that her ability to form the requisite intent
was impaired by
PTSD.[^\[4\]^](#Xcfa89ae130f86101dcb729ea39e699304b8fed8) First degree
premeditated murder requires \"premeditated intent.\" **\[ ... \]** The
lesser included crime of second degree murder requires the \"intent to
cause the death of another
person.\"[^\[5\]^](#Xa58345237d07431ac8bca9f1d33076dcdf44896) The State
bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
had the requisite mental state for the crime charged. ***\[ ... \]***.
When specific intent or knowledge is an element of the crime charged, a
defendant is entitled to present evidence showing an inability to form
the specific intent or knowledge at the time of the crime. ***\[ ...
\]***

According to the American Psychiatric Association:

The essential feature of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is the
development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme
traumatic stressor involving direct personal experience of an event that
involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat
to one\'s physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves
death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person;
or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat
of **\[ ... \]** death or injury experienced by a family member or other
close associate.

American Psychiatric Association, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF
MENTAL DISORDERS, 424 (4th ed.1994).

One hallmark of PTSD is flashback, a condition \"during which components
of the \[traumatic\] event are relived and the person behaves as though
experiencing the event at that moment. American Psychiatric Association,
DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, 424 (4th
ed.1994). When a person has a flashback, he or she undergoes an
\"alteration in the perception or experience of the self in which the
usual sense of one\'s own reality is temporarily lost or changed.\"
American Psychiatric Association, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF
MENTAL DISORDERS, 275 (3rd ed. revised 1987). While in this state, the
person experiences \"\[v\]arious types of sensory anesthesia and a
sensation of not being in complete control of one\'s actions, including
speech.\" American Psychiatric Association, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL
MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, 275 (3rd ed. revised 1987). So, a person who
truly suffers from PTSD could experience a flashback and during that
flashback might be unable to control his or her actions. As one
commentator stated:

> Ordinarily, persons with PTSD are in contact with reality and do not
> display any symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations or delusions.
> PTSD is essentially an anxiety disorder. However, some patients,
> especially those who are subsequently subjected to extreme stress,
> develop a transient dissociative reaction with episodes of
> depersonalization or derealization. Most of the time, these feelings
> of unreality pass without incident, but occasionally criminal behavior
> may erupt. The question of criminal responsibility, therefore, is
> pertinent since a person\'s cognitive or volitional state may be
> impaired during a dissociative reaction.

Chester B. Scrignar, M.D., POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: DIAGNOSIS,
TREATMENT, AND LEGAL ISSUES, 245 (2d ed.1988).

Washington case law acknowledges that PTSD is recognized within the
scientific and psychiatric communities and can affect the intent of the
actor resulting in diminished capacity. *See* *State v. Janes,* 121
Wash.2d 220, 233-36, 850 P.2d 495 (1993) (battered woman and battered
child syndromes are a subset of PTSD and are admissible to show how
severe abuse affects the battered person\'s perceptions and
reactions)**\[ ... \]**.

Therefore, we hold that PTSD is generally accepted by the scientific and
psychiatric communities as a condition that may result in the diminished
capacity of the actor.

**\[ ... \]**

Because a generally-accepted link exists between PTSD and diminished
capacity, the trial court should have admitted the testimony of Dr.
Stanulis if he testified that: (1) Bottrell suffered from PTSD; (2) as a
result of her PTSD she experienced flashbacks during the incident with
Hall; and (3) the flashbacks impaired her ability to act with intent.
Dr. Stanulis evaluated Bottrell by reviewing over 9 years of police
reports, interviewing her for about 4.5 hours, and administering the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Dr. Stanulis testified to
each element during the offer of proof. First, Dr. Stanulis testified
that Bottrell suffered from PTSD. According to him, Bottrell \"met the
criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder\[,\]\" Report of Proceedings
at 88, and opined \"to a medical certainty\" that she suffered from the
condition. Report of Proceedings at 90-91. The State\'s expert, Dr.
Ronald Hart, agreed that Bottrell was suffering from resolving PTSD, but
asserted that its onset was triggered by Hall\'s death. Second, Dr.
Stanulis testified that Bottrell experienced flashbacks during the
incident with Hall: \"at the time of \[the incident with Hall\] \... she
was describing, symptoms of a flashback, she was re-experiencing \[170\]
past abusive episodes.\"**\[ ... \]**

Finally, Dr. Stanulis testified that Bottrell\'s flashbacks impaired her
ability to act with intent:

A: \[The flashbacks\] are, of course, by definition quite emotionally
laden events, and they would directly affect her ability to both
perceive what was going on about her accurately and to form specific
intents.

Q: Do you have an opinion as to what triggered the inability to form the
specific intent?

A: Well, she was clearly in a position where she perceived herself again
in an abusive position where her life was being threatened. Again, to
what degree that is from a reasonable perspective and what degree that
is influenced by her hypervigilance and her PTSD, which would tend to
see things as sometimes more dangerous than they are, I think both are
arguably present.

> Certainly when you start to be flooded with memories of abusive
> events, emotional, that\'s a very strong emotional content. This is an
> individual who has lived many years of her life as a substance abuser
> to avoid those feelings. So it\'s hard to imagine that when those
> feelings and those memories are flooding her that she would be able to
> form the specific intent and be responding only to that which is in
> front of her.

**\[ ... \]**

Dr. Stanulis\'s testimony would assist the jury in determining if
Bottrell had the requisite specific intent to murder Hall.**\[ ... \]**
Such evidence is relevant**\[ ... \]** to determine whether Bottrell\'s
mental capacity was diminished. Further, Dr. Stanulis\'s testimony was
admissible because he based it upon a \"medical certainty\" that the
malady, PTSD, affected Bottrell. **\[ ... \]**In the offer of proof Dr.
Stanulis was asked the specific question of \"Do you have an opinion as
to whether she was able to form the specific intent to commit
premeditated first degree murder in this case.\" **\[ ... \]** Although,
in Stanulis\'s opinion, Bottrell was not able to form specific intent to
commit first degree premeditated murder, he offered no opinion about her
ability to form an intent to steal from Hall, dead or alive. Rather, he
focused solely on Bottrell\'s state of mind at the time of the killing,
when she was reexperiencing via flashbacks past abusive episodes in her
life.

Here, if Bottrell suffered from PTSD at the time of Hall\'s murder, the
disorder may have negated the intent necessary for the crime charged,
first degree premeditated murder, and for its lesser included offense of
second degree murder. Because Dr. Stanulis testified that Bottrell
suffered from PTSD, that the PTSD caused flashbacks, and that the
flashbacks impaired Bottrell\'s ability to act with intent, the trial
court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Stanulis\'s testimony at
trial. ***\[ ... \]***We reverse this conviction and remand for a new
trial on the issue of second degree murder.

## FIRST DEGREE FELONY MURDER

First degree felony murder has two elements: (1) a homicide; (2)
committed \"in the course of or in furtherance of \... or in**\[ ...
\]**immediate flight\" from a robbery. **\[ ... \]**\"Robbery\" is
defined as:

> \[U\]nlawfully tak\[ing\] personal property from the person of another
> or in his presence against his will by the use or threatened use of
> immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person or his
> property\[.\]\... Such force or fear must be used to obtain or retain
> possession of the property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to
> the taking\[.\] \... Such taking constitutes robbery whenever it
> appears that, although the taking was fully completed without the
> knowledge of the person from whom taken, such knowledge was prevented
> by the use of force or fear.

**\[ ... \]**

Although Stanulis\'s testimony would have reflected on whether Bottrell
had the requisite intent to murder, such intent to murder is not an
element of felony murder. ***\[ ... \]***Rather, the intent required to
prove robbery is intent to deprive the victim of property. ***\[ ...
\]***

> Since the \[felony murder\] statute does not require the state to
> prove the intent with which a murder is committed, when it is done in
> connection with the perpetration of a robbery, mere lack of an intent
> to rob at the moment of the killing is not a defense.

*State v. Craig,* 82 Wash.2d 777, 783, 514 P.2d 151 (1973).

A homicide is committed in connection with the perpetration of a felony
if it is in \"close proximity in terms of time and distance between the
felony and the homicide and there was no break in the chain of events
from the inception of the felony to the time of the homicide.\" CHARLES
E. TORCIA, 2 WHARTON\'S CRIMINAL LAW § 150 at 312-14 (15th ed.1994) **\[
... \]**. That the homicide preceded the final act of the robbery,
namely the theft, does not fragment the chain of events. ***\[ ...
\]***It is enough that Bottrell admitted to a cellmate that she went to
Hall\'s house to steal from him, he tried to stop her and called police,
and the deadly fight ensued. **\[ ... \]**

There was sufficient evidence to prove that Bottrell committed felony
murder. And Dr. Stanulis\'s excluded PTSD testimony would not **\[ ...
\]** have materially borne on Bottrell\'s intent to rob Hall.

## CHARGE

## JACK B. WEINSTEIN, Senior District Judge:

**\[ ... \]**

## *I. Introduction*

Defendant, Peter Polizzi, was charged with --- and convicted after a
jury trial of --- twelve counts of receipt and eleven counts of
possession of images of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. §.§ 2252(a)
(2) and 2252(a)(4)(B), *see* Superseding Indictment, Mar. 8, 2007,
Docket Entry No. 35, after a search of his home\'s detached garage
resulted in the discovery of over 5,000 digital images stored on his
computers and hard drives. At trial, Polizzi pleaded the affirmative
defense of not guilty by reason of insanity under the federal Insanity
Defense Reform Act of 1984 (\"IDRA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 17. The jury rejected
the defense. **\[ ... \]**

The insanity defense was largely predicated on Polizzi\'s having himself
been severely sexually abused as a child and the psychological
aftereffects. **\[ ... \]**

## *A. Defendant*

Defendant**\[ ... \]**was brought to this country when he was a young
teenager after a childhood in Sicilian poverty; had little formal
education, yet, after teaching himself to play an instrument, led a
popular local band; worked extremely long hours at menial labor as a
boy, and then bought and built-up a successful restaurant; had a loving
wife and five supportive lawfully engaged sons; lived in a fine home;
was well respected in the community by the **\[ ... \]**police, clergy
and others; had no criminal record; viewed the charged pornography
downloaded from the Internet alone in a double-locked room above his
garage; and, upon his arrest, cooperated fully with the police,
suggesting to them that whoever participated in producing these dreadful
pornographic images should be prosecuted. His testimony as to the severe
sexual abuse he had suffered while a child in Sicily was credible and
moving.

## **\[ ... \]**

At trial the only contested issue was Polizzi\'s affirmative defense of
legal insanity. **\[ ... \]** Polizzi admitted collecting child
pornography and described at length how and why he began to do so. His
testimony --- accepted as truthful by the jury --- was that severe
childhood sexual abuse had caused him, as an adult, to develop what
experts referred to as an obsessive-compulsive disorder (\"OCD\") and
hoarding behavior as well as a post-traumatic stress disorder
(\"PTSD\"). As a result of the trauma he re-experienced upon
accidentally stumbling across child pornography on the Internet and
seeing other children being sexually abused, he claimed he began to
collect child pornography to turn over to law enforcement in a misguided
attempt to \"help the children.\" Until his arrest, however, Polizzi
never told anyone about his collection.

**\[ ... \]**The government requested that the court**\[ ... \]**issue a
jury charge defining \"wrongfulness\" under the IDRA to be \"*contrary
to public morality,* as well as contrary to law.\" **\[ ...
\]**Defendant opposed, arguing for a standard jury instruction **\[ ...
\]**which does not specifically define \"wrongfulness.\" **\[ ...
\]**The court denied both requests and issued its own instruction,
defining \"wrongfulness\" as \"unlawfulness.\" **\[ ... \]**

minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct were not disputed.

To satisfy the IDRA, Polizzi had the burden of proving by \"clear and
convincing\" evidence that he was legally insane when the offenses
occurred in that he: 1) had a \"severe mental disease or defect\" at the
time he downloaded the images over a period of some five years; and 2)
as a result he had been \"unable\"to appreciate the nature and quality
or the wrongfulness of his acts.\" 18 U.S.C. § 17. **\[ ... \]**

## *Id.*

Focusing on Polizzi\'s childhood sexual abuse, the defense emphasized
its lasting psychological effects as manifested in his post-traumatic
stress and obsessive-compulsive disorders. *See* Dr. Goldsmith\'s
Addendum: Psych. Rep. 1, Jan. 2, 2007 (\"\[W\]hen viewing child
pornography on the Internet \[Polizzi\] had a retraumatizing experience.
In a regressed and obsessive state he downloaded and searched child
pornographic images for evidence of victimization, something he had
experienced as a child.\"). According to defense counsel,

> Mr. Polizzi was doing what he believed to be right. He could not
> appreciate that downloading pictures of the children was wrong. What
> is wrong, what Mr. Polizzi knows is wrong \... is child abuse\.... Mr.
> Polizzi, in a wrong way maybe, but in his way because of his
> psychological trauma, is trying to figure out a way to stop child
> abuse.

**\[ ... \]**

The jury found Polizzi guilty on all counts. **\[ ... \]**

The jury ultimately rejected\" Polizzi\'s defense of legal insanity. It
was justified in doing so. Despite defendant\'s mental problems, a jury
could find that he was able to appreciate the nature and quality and the
wrongfulness of his acts (i.e., the downloading and possessing images of
child pornography). **\[ ... \]**At the time he obtained and viewed the
images, Polizzi testified, he believed he was not violating the law or
morality. *Once he was told his actions were illegal, he understood they
were wrong.* **\[ ... \]** (\"Now I know it\'s wrong, but back then I
didn\'t --- I didn\'t know it was wrong\"); **\[ ... \]**(\"When we
\[the police\] explained the circumstances to him of what possessing
child pornography was, what it actually meant, he was remorseful. He
understood that it isn\'t just possessing pictures, we spoke to him
about that. It wasn\'t just having these images and looking at them
that, it was damaging children and he became remorseful.\").

## **\[ ... \]**

After the jury was discharged, some members of the jury supported a
sentence providing for mental health treatment rather than imprisonment.
**\[ ... \]** They wanted treatment and close supervision to prevent a
recurrence, not the mandatory minimum term of no less than five years\'
incarceration.

## *II. Legal Insanity Defense*

## **\[ ... \]**

The IDRA does not define \"wrongfulness.\" *M\'Naghten\'s Case,* 8 Eng.
Rep. 718 (1843), upon which the IDRA is based, specifically \"used the
term \`wrong\' instead of \`illegal\' to prevent confound\[ing\] the
jury, by inducing them to believe that an actual knowledge of the law of
the land was essential in order to lead to a conviction.\" *Ewing,* 494
F.3d at 619 (quoting *M\'Naghten,* 8 Eng. Rep. at 723). **\[ ... \]**

The *Ewing* court provided a matrix of alternative possible
interpretations:

> In the context of the insanity defense, courts and scholars have
> generally proposed three alternative definitions for the term: (1)
> legal wrongfulness, as in \"contrary to law\"; (2) moral wrongfulness,
> as in \"contrary to public morality,\" determined objectively by
> reference to society\'s condemnation of the act as morally wrong; or
> (3) moral wrongfulness, as in \"contrary to *personal* morality,\"
> determined subjectively by reference to the defendant\'s belief that
> his action was morally justified (even if he appreciated that it was
> illegal or contrary to public morality).

**\[ ... \]**

There was no need in the present case to explore with the jury the
difference between moral and legal wrongfulness. **\[ ... \]** The child
pornography pictures --- both still and moving --- were so hideously
inappropriate that they were recognized by all participants in the
trial, including defendant and the jury, as morally wrong and
appropriately characterized as legally wrong. In context,
\"wrongfulness\" and \"unlawfulness\" were congruent insofar as the
receipt and possession of child pornography was criminal.

**\[ ... \]**

There is merit in the government\'s contention that appreciation of both
law and community views of morality must be considered in applying the
statute. But a difficulty with the government\'s suggested use of a
\"contrary to public morality\" charge is that community views of what
should be punishable as pornography vary greatly. **\[ ... \]**To
explicitly introduce the issue of morality in a case such as this
one,**\[ ... \]** would be likely to confuse many jurors.

> \"\[T\]here is no provable \`national standard\' \[of obscenity\]\"
> \.... It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the
> First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi
> accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or
> New York City. People in different States vary in their tastes and
> attitudes, and this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism
> of imposed uniformity.

*Miller v. California,* 413 U.S. 15, 32-33, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973) (quoting *Jacobellis v. Ohio,* 378 U.S. 184, 200, 84 S.Ct.
1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (Warren, C.J., dissenting) (footnote and
citations omitted)); *see also* *Jacobellis,* 378 U.S. at 197, 84 S.Ct.
1676 (Stewart, J., concurring) (\"\[F\]aced with the task of trying to
define what may be indefinable\.... I shall not today attempt further to
define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that
shorthand description \.... But I know it when I see it\") (footnotes
omitted).

Injecting a \"public morality\" element into the instruction
unnecessarily complicates the jury\'s job, possibly leading to more
intrajury conflicts and mistrials. **\[ ... \]**

Just as there is no one-size-fitsall public morality given our
country\'s extraordinary heterogeneity, the imposition into the insanity
defense of local interpretations**\[ ... \]** of public morality via a
jury composed of a cross-section of the local community compounds the
difficulties of reaching a consensus verdict.

Here the statutory definition is fairly precise, so that the court need
not be concerned with varying views of what is immoral pornography.
*See* 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) (prohibiting knowing receipt of \"any
visual depiction \... if (A) the producing of such visual depiction
involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and
(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct\"); 18 U.S.C. §
2252(a)(4)(B) (prohibiting knowing possession of same). There was no
doubt that the charged images briefly shown at trial fell within the
statutory law. Thus, a definition sticking closely to that in the
statute defining the illegal acts, rather than adding the issue of
general morality, was appropriate. The need for precision is
particularly important in a case such as the present once, where the
emotional animus of the community against the acts charged is great.

## **\[ ... \]**

Polizzi did not request a non-pattern jury instruction defining insanity
in terms of his own subjective personal morality. **\[ ... \]**The crux
of his insanity claim lay in his assertion that seeing the images had
retraumatized and reminded him of his own abuse; his PTSD, obsessive
compulsiveness, and hoarding impulse caused him to begin collecting the
images **\[ ... \]** as a way of \"saving\" the children by taking the
images \"off the Internet; and that he was searching for images of his
uncle, his primary abuser, or of himself as a child. A \"contrary to
public morality charge\" was irrelevant.

**\[ ... \]**

Although Polizzi did testify that he did not know that child pornography
was illegal, he told the jury he had been shocked to learn that such
images existed on the Internet, believed they were wrong, and wished
they were illegal. **\[ ... \]**. The jury could appropriately have
concluded that Polizzi did appreciate the inherent wrongfulness of child
pornography, and, once informed of the law, could appreciate that
downloading it was illegal. **\[ ... \]**

Environmental Deprivation and Psychological Injury

 

If insanity and duress can excuse criminal behavior, why can't social
and economic distress affect culpability? The theory that environmental
deprivation or a "rotten social background" should excuse criminal
liability has been widely discussed. Some research indicates that
growing up in impoverished, unstable, and violent environments can
affect moral judgment---implicating the M'Naghten test---or other
attributes such as self-control---perhaps implicating the irresistible
impulse test. Nevertheless, the idea of an environmental deprivation
excuse remains highly controversial, and there are many distinctions
between insanity and environmental deprivation. As you read the
following passages, consider both the similarities and the differences
between environmental deprivation and the excuses we have studied.
Remember, too, that criminal law is partly moral, and partly
instrumental. What would be the practical effects of recognizing an
environmental deprivation defense?

**v.**

**BELL, Superintendent of State Colony Epileptics and Feeble Minded.**

**No. 292.**

Argued April 22, 1927.

Decided May 2, 1927.

**\[ ... \]**

Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a writ of error to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Appeals of the State of Virginia, affirming a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Amherst County, by which the defendant in error, the
superintendent of the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded, was
ordered to perform the operation of salpingectomy upon Carrie Buck, the
plaintiff in error, for the purpose of making her sterile. **\[ ... \]**
The case comes here upon the contention that the statute authorizing the
judgment is void under the Fourteenth Amendment as denying to the
plaintiff in error due process of law and the equal protection of the
laws.

Carrie Buck is a feeble-minded white woman who was committed to the
State Colony above mentioned in due form. She is the daughter of a
feeble-minded mother in the same institution, and the mother of an
illegitimate feeble-minded child. She was eighteen years old at the time
of the trial of her case in the Circuit Court in the latter part of
1924. An Act of Virginia approved March 20, 1924 **\[ ... \]**recites
that the health of the patient and the welfare of society may be
promoted in certain cases by the sterilization of mental defectives,
under careful safeguard, etc.; that the sterilization may be effected in
males by vasectomy and in females by salpingectomy, without serious pain
or substantial danger to life; that the Commonwealth is supporting in
various institutions many defective persons who if now discharged would
become

**\[ ... \]**

a menace but if incapable of procreating might be discharged with safety
and become self-supporting with benefit to themselves and to society;
and that experience has shown that heredity plays an important part in
the transmission of insanity, imbecility, etc. The statute then enacts
that whenever the superintendent of certain institutions including the
abovenamed State Colony shall be of opinion that it is for the best
interest of the patients and of society that an inmate under his care
should be sexually sterilized, he may have the operation performed upon
any patient afflicted with hereditary forms of insanity, imbecility,
etc., on complying with the very careful provisions by which the act
protects the patients from possible abuse.

**\[ ... \]**

There can be no doubt that so far as procedure is concerned the rights
of the patient are most carefully considered, and as every step in this
case was taken in scrupulous compliance with the statute and after
months of observation, there is no doubt that in that respect the
plaintiff in error has had due process at law.

The attack is not upon the procedure but upon the substantive law. It
seems to be contended that in no circumstances could such an order be
justified. It certainly is contended that the order cannot be justified
upon the existing grounds. The judgment finds**\[ ... \]**that Carrie
Buck \'is the probable potential parent of socially inadequate
offspring, likewise afflicted, that she may be sexually sterilized
without detriment to her general health and that her welfare and that of
society will be promoted by her sterilization,\' and thereupon makes the
order. In view of the general declarations of the Legislature and the
specific findings of the Court obviously we cannot say as matter of law
that the grounds do not exist, and if they exist they justify the
result. We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call
upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could
not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these
lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in
order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for
all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for
crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent
those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle
that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting
the Fallopian tubes. **\[ ... \]**Three generations of imbeciles are
enough.

**\[ ... \]**

But, it is said, however it might be if this reasoning were applied
generally, it fails when it is confined to the small number who are in
the institutions named and is not applied to the multitudes outside.
**\[ ... \]** But the answer is that the law does all that is needed
when it does all that it can, indicates a policy, applies it to all
within the lines, and seeks to bring within the lines all similary
situated so far and so fast as its means allow. Of course so far as the
operations enable those who otherwise must be kept confined to be
returned to the world, and thus open the asylum to others, the equality
aimed at will be more nearly reached.

Judgment affirmed.

Mr. Justice BUTLER dissents.

\
Court of Appeal, Second District,\
Division 8.

## The PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. Harvey KOBAYASHI, Defendant and Appellant.

No. B157685.

(Los Angeles County Super. Ct. No. NA049139).

March 26, 2003.

 

**\[ ... \]**

## Opinion

## COOPER, P.J.

**\[ ... \]** Following a jury trial, Harvey Kobayashi was convicted of
the second degree murder of Sheila Ann Randle, a woman he met through a
telephone dating service. He admits stabbing her to death with her
eight-year-old son in the apartment, cleaning the bloody scene, and then
burning her body after moving it to his family's farm in Dinuba.
Appellant proffered principally a defense of imperfect self-defense,
i.e., the victim made threats to kill him and his parents after he could
or would not continue making payments to her or buy her a house;
instructions on heat of passion and provocation were also given. The
trial court excluded testimony of appellant's expert witness, a
psychologist, and gave or failed to give instructions appellant now
contests. Sentenced to 16 years to life in prison, appellant appeals the
judgment of conviction.[^1^](#X13ad4f2b6625615cee939302ef61993b1c09367)
**\[ ... \]**

As defense counsel noted, the issue for the jury was not "what"
happened, but "why." Appellant's state of mind was the key to the
defense, which sought a conviction of manslaughter instead of
murder.[^5^](#X8562b34b982b0ab73ea43b4d905ddbbe95b9a5b)

**\[ ... \]** Appellant's relationship with the victim was complicated.
He first contacted her in about June 1999 and began to know her on the
telephone as "Frankie," a woman on a date phone line. **\[ ...
\]**Within a short time, Frankie began asking appellant for increasing
amounts of money. Appellant provided the money but never met Frankie;
instead, the funds were given to Ebony, who pretended to be Frankie's
good friend but was really the same woman as Frankie and as the victim,
Sheila Randle. Soon, Frankie's requests escalated from babysitting
money, to rental cars, leasing a Honda and then a Monte Carlo, clothes,
expensive jewelry, alleged medical
expenses,[^7^](#X0fee876320944d67e7ac77fa0bf751d2adc5bcd) and thousands
of dollars in loans or
gifts.[^8^](#X5e2eff8be8db004a856c658461f6ff97deb8a12) However, it was
"Ebony" who received much of this money, went to lease the Honda in
November 1999, and was then in the middle of these
transactions.[^9^](#X86ccde3ffc80bf788030e3123c03c3a65de809e)

Appellant's financial circumstances became worse and worse. He filed for
bankruptcy in November or December 1999 but continued his financing of
Frankie's wishes. In February 2000, he moved back to Dinuba to take care
of his elderly parents**\[ ... \]**. Thinking Frankie could not trace
him, appellant had the Honda repossessed. "Ebony" called him in Dinuba
and said the car was stolen; when she figured out he had it taken,
appellant testified she said "he'd better get the fucking car or they
are going to come and kill his mother and
father."[^10^](#X04d5069f20d55f00fc13a95415165175e578e93) Appellant then
returned the car to Ebony. 

At one point, according to appellant, a Black female (but not Ebony)
called and said Frankie had committed suicide because appellant left
without letting her know where he was going. Ebony called later that
night and said Frankie, whom he still believe existed, had attempted to
commit suicide and tried to get him to pay for the funeral expenses.
According to appellant, Frankie was threatening to kill his mother and
father so he paid her thousands for alleged medical bills. 

In July 2000, he went with Sheila to trade the Honda for a Monte Carlo;
appellant borrowed \$8000 from his mother and a friend. He testified he
felt he had "no choice" but to make the payments; Frankie/Sheila was
threatening to hurt his mother and father, saying she would make
appellant watch as her friends shot his parents. 

In November 2000, appellant testified he was scared by Frankie's threats
and called the Tulare County Sheriff, told of very vague threats, and
asked for someone to drive by. A tape of that call was played for the
jury. He made no other calls to law enforcement.

The demands became more pressing. They had looked at homes in Palmdale.
He did not want to buy a place for Sheila and Frankie in Palmdale, but
he did not want to make a scene. He also did not and could not buy the
expensive house the victim wanted him to buy her in Carson shortly
before her death.

**\[ ... \]**Although the point when he realized that all three women
were the same is in dispute, even appellant admits suspecting that
reality and knowing it by January 2001, when Sheila purportedly told
him.[^11^](#Xc3107802abc91690cd315082a003e5d7f0167b1) Appellant signed
rental papers for an apartment in Long Beach for Sheila Randle and
himself in February 2001. There is evidence he visited her on weekends.

According to the apartment manager, appellant was at the apartment
roughly every other weekend. The victim's mother testified he slept on
the sofa on one visit and in Sheila's bed at the mother's house once
before Sheila moved to the Long Beach apartment. Appellant vehemently
denied any type of sexual or romantic relationship with Sheila or
discussions about having a baby with
her.[^12^](#X0148b65f421da6cb7c403b48e4a16eede4553a6) He admitted
initial romantic thoughts about Frankie but testified her threats and
anger changed that. 

Danella Wright, the victim's friend who lived in Palmdale, met appellant
on several occasions, including a visit to Palmdale for appellant and
Sheila to look at a home to buy or an apartment for Sheila and her son
to rent. She saw no stress in the relationship, and appellant and Sheila
seemed friendly to each other. At one point in 2000, Sheila told her
that Harvey was buying her a town home but later reported that he could
not get it in his name so he was going to try to get it for her in a
friend's name. Near the holidays in 2000, Sheila showed her friend a
ring that looked like an engagement ring and said appellant gave it to
her; asked if she was going to marry him, Sheila replied "I'm not sure."
On another visit, in 2001, appellant drove the two women and a friend to
shop in Chinatown. Ms. Wright later helped Sheila decorate her new
apartment in Long Beach; she used an Asian theme in the living room,
just as Ms. Wright had in her own house. Sheila later bought a Buddha
for the living room table.

Sheila was about 5′2″ to 5′4″ and between 160 and 198 pounds. Danella
Wright described her friend as "Wild. Fast, a lot of life to her" and
very vocal. Her mother described Sheila as an outspoken individual, a
talker, who completed 11th grade and was 28 years old when she died.
Makeba Fielding, her best friend, told detectives that Sheila was quite
a mouthpiece, a loud person, could get physical very easily and could be
easily provoked.

Appellant testified that he came to Long Beach at Sheila's demand on the
night of April 6. She threatened to kill his mother if he did not come
down from Dinuba.[^13^](#X943bb4e9f893fac87a7c21991c533fe49ea54bd) They
shared a bed that night, at her insistence; appellant denies any
romantic touching. On the morning of her death, Sheila got upset and
said he should buy her the \$340,000 "fucking" house even if he had to
force his mother to sell the ranch or if she had to dig up his father,
who had died in October 2000, out of the grave. She swore at him and
asked where the \$8000 was.

Appellant's version of the killing is that he went to the kitchen
drawer, saw the knife, and took it for his own protection, thinking
Sheila had talked about a gun before and he did not know if one was in
the house. Hiding the knife behind him, he returned to the master
bedroom and listened to her yell about the house, the \$8000, and her
threats to send friends to his mother's house to make him watch while
they killed his mother and then killed him. She allegedly then said "you
better fucking do it" and "I'm going to kill you." When she came towards
him with a fist, he displayed the knife and without warning stuck her in
the chest. They struggled and he stabbed her three to five
times.[^14^](#X6e90bbc83c9ea7bab80c27c5c900cb5a56f37ee) He testified he
had no intention to kill her the night before, the morning when he woke
up, or even when he went to the kitchen to get the knife. Rather, he was
"freaking out" and in a daze and panic. **\[ ... \]**

*Defense psychologist*

The defense wished to present testimony by psychologist Adrienne Davis,
an assistant clinical professor in the Department of Psychology at the
University of Southern California who had examined appellant and
prepared an 8-page report. **\[ ... \]** The trial court **\[ ... \]**

excluded the testimony and the court could not "see admissible testimony
insofar as the psychiatric opinion from the report. If you don't have
anything to add to her report, that would be the court's
ruling."[^15^](#Xf9cece5cf2a28c7bd9da1a586afe2c75da5c932) Dr. Davis was
not called by the defense, which urges on appeal that the exclusion of
her testimony was reversible error.

**\[ ... \]** She set forth appellant's family history, including that
he is a 46-year-old "second-generation Japanese man" who never married
and has no children. He was raised by his parents in the Central
California town of Dinuba. His two brothers were at least 15 years older
than appellant and by the time he reached his teenage years they had
each started their own families. His parents "were 'from the old school'
in terms \[of\] values, discipline, the importance of working hard,
independence, academic achievement and commitment to family."

Appellant was shy and reserved and did not date in high school. His
parents were active in church, and he was involved in the Young Buddhist
Association. He completed high school in 1973, went to community
college, and then graduated from Cal State Long Beach. He worked for UPS
and eventually for Hughes Aircraft, Magnavox, Rockwell, and TRW. He was
an avid bass fisherman and spent more time developing his fishing hobby
than pursuing relationships. However, he was "curious" about on-line
relationships and contacted the victim, leading her taking thousands of
dollars from him while representing herself as someone else. The report
continued: "When asked why he continued to given even when he felt he
was being exploited, he reported that she was so demanding, and he felt
sorry for her and wanted to help her out even at his own expense. When
he finally could not longer meet her demands, he tried to extricate
himself from the relationship but to no avail." According to the report,
he became increasingly afraid and feared the worst. When his bankruptcy,
moving away, and repossession of the car did not stop the demands as he
had hoped, her demands became even more intense. From his report "he
found himself in a situation for which he had no frame of reference, no
experience and no solution, and about which he felt vulnerable, fearful
and embarrassed."

**\[ ... \]** Dr. Davis reported on her observations of appellant and
his test results. His one significant elevation in a certain subscale
was for "over-controlled hostility," a scale used "in the late 1960s to
define and describe a group of inmates who had \[no\] prior history of
violence, in fact, were model citizens until one day they erupted into
uncontrollable violence that everyone who knew them argued was 'out of
character.' "

Another clinical scale that was significantly elevated was one for
compulsiveness. According to the report, such individuals "exhibit an
unusual adherence to social conventions," deny any internal conflict and
tend to be hard working and conscientious.

Dr. Davis opined: "These results seem to describe \[appellant\] quite
well. Certainly *there are cultural issues that contribute to his
personality development* including a tendency to over-value emotional
control, strong work ethic, deference to authority, denial of needs, the
experience of shame when one is unable to meet the expectations of
others and violates one's own personal standards. The combination of
these factors contributed to \[his\] mental state at the time of this
offense. He was angry, overwhelmed, confused and without appropriate
outlets for managing this situation." (Italics added.)

Dr. Davis's summary and discussion again set forth his lack of
relationships with women and his family background in a "strict,
conservative, *traditional Asian family* with hard-working parents who
set a positive example for their three sons." (Italics added.) She
opined that because of his inadequacy in relationships "and equally
strong sense of loyalty, trust and generosity, \[he\] was vulnerable to
the potential exploits of anyone with more street smarts than himself,
who would recognize his vulnerability and his gullibility and take full
advantage. The fact that the victim could pose as another person over
many, many months and continue to get money from him when he had yet to
meet her is a testament to his naiveté, his desperate need to be needed,
strong denial mechanisms, his inexperience and failure to recognize and
appreciate the pathology and danger in this relationship early on."

Moreover, "It is not at all surprising that \[appellant\] could not
bring himself to contact police when the victim began to threaten him.
His feelings of shame and embarrassment about the entire situation far
outweighed any rational thinking and thereby further isolated him from
those who may have been able to assist him. Just as salient were
underling feelings of frustration and outrage, feelings for which he had
no appropriate outlet. \[He\] was quite simply, overwhelmed. He was
isolated, alone and frightened, left to cope with a novel escalating
situations that had become wildly out of control. The dynamics of
\[his\] personality, which are *influenced by Asian culture,* dictate a
certain amount of emotional suppression, self-sacrifice and self-blame."
(Italics added.)

**\[ ... \]** Dr. Davis concluded: "Up until the time of this offense,
\[appellant\] was a law-abiding, productive citizen with a responsible
job, who found peace, satisfaction and fulfillment through competitive
bass-fishing. He was a devoted son who had recently lost his father.
However, having a successful relationship with a woman continued to
elude him and his inept efforts to resolve this area of his life led to
a tragic ending."

***\[ ... \]***

Appellant contends:**\[ ... \]**The trial court's exclusion of the
proffered cultural evidence by the defense expert deprived appellant of
his constitutional rights to due process and to a jury trial. **\[ ...
\]** a. The trial court had a sua sponte duty**\[ ... \]**to instruct
that the jury should consider cultural evidence in determining the
sufficiency of the provocation. b. There is an equal protection and due
process right to a culturally specific evaluation of the element of
provocation as it relates to the crime of manslaughter. **\[ ... \]**

Appellant wanted to use the expert's report in order to negate malice
and have his crime reduced to voluntary manslaughter **\[ ... \]** and
on appeal claims its exclusion deprived him of his constitutional rights
to due process and to a jury trial. He recognizes that evaluation of
heat of passion or provocation is dependent on the reaction of the
hypothetical "reasonable person of average disposition" and cites cases
stating that the jurors must place themselves in the shoes of the
defendant and then judge whether his conduct was reasonable. **\[ ...
\]** He argues that the jurors, in placing themselves in "like
circumstances," are able to consider the physical, mental, and cultural
characteristics of the defendant.

**\[ ... \]** Appellant analogizes his predicament to the defense of
battered women's syndrome, arguing: "It is understandable that a
Japanese man may react violently to the latest in a series of threats
over two years after hiding the festering shame and embarrassment of
having cause his own desperate predicament. A predicament initiated by
his loneliness and resulting in further anomie when bullied and extorted
by death threats to himself and to his parents. For in Japanese culture,
intense shame attaches to males who lack emotional control, who are
unable to meet the expectations of others, and who violate their
personal standards. (Davis Report, pp. 7-8.) Certainly, appellant's
cultural standards for filial piety were repeatedly trashed by Sheila
Randle's orders to borrow money from his elderly mother, to give her a
share of his father's funeral proceeds, to sell the farm from under his
mother, and even to dig his father up from his grave if that \[is\] what
it took to get her a house." Moreover, "\[h\]ere, there was evidence
that appellant had experienced a series of events over two-year period
which culminated in the heated argument where Sheila threatened to make
him watch as her friends killed his mother and then threatened to kill
him as she charged at him with her fist even after he brandished the
knife." Thus, "\[t\]he expert testimony concerning Japanese culture was
relevant to explain the significance of these events on appellant's
state of mind, and to show how Sheila's verbal threats and physical
assault could have constituted 'sufficient provocation' to cause
appellant to kill her in a 'heat of passion' or how he acted in an
unreasonable, but good faith, belief to act in self-defense."
Furthermore, he contends that that theory "could not be fully understood
by the jury without reference to the expert testimony explaining the
cultural evidence factors affecting appellant's state of mind."

[**^\[1\]^**](%5Cl%20%22co_anchor_F12003238230_1%22) **\[ ... \]**The
argument below focused on appellant's effort to demonstrate his actual,
if perhaps objectively unreasonable, belief that "he had no option but
to do what he did at the time it happened." **\[ ... \]**

Our reading of Dr. Davis's report**\[ ... \]** is that she mentioned
appellant's family background and Japanese culture, found his
personality was decisive in his actions, but only vaguely tied his
personality characteristics to his cultural background, e.g., "The
dynamics of Mr. Kobayashi's personality, which are influenced by Asian
culture, dictate a certain amount of emotional suppression,
self-sacrifice and self-blame." Neither the report nor appellant's own
testimony adequately related his cultural background to evidence that
would be admissible as to his state of mind. Furthermore, defense
counsel was allowed to argue appellant's personality traits, in evidence
through appellant's own testimony and reports of his conduct from
others, in urging the jury to find imperfect
self-defense.[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](#Xab663d51776c4d41f38f66f533107cc6a0b2910)

Thus, on the record before us, the trial court did not err in excluding
Dr. Davis's testimony as it was presented in the offer of proof. We need
not and do not decide if a different offer of proof with a more thorough
analysis of a defendant's cultural background and beliefs, tied in with
a defendant's testimony that would support the expert's opinion, would
compel admission of such expert testimony. In addition, we cannot
conclude that a result more favorable to appellant would have resulted
from any cumulative evidence in Dr. Davis's report.

***\[ ... \]***

[**^\[\ ...\ \]^**](%5Cl%20%22co_anchor_F22003238230_1%22)The trial
court instructed the jury in terms of **\[ ... \]**the standard
instruction on regarding sudden quarrel or heat of passion and
provocation. Appellant contends that such an instruction is
"insufficient standing alone to inform the jury that it should evaluate
the sufficiency of provocation from the standpoint of a reasonable
person in terms of defendant's position as a Japanese American;"**\[ ...
\]** and the court prejudicially erred in failing to give a sua sponte
instruction on the relevancy of cultural evidence to the reasonable
person standard.^19^

The instructions given were correct. Appellant was allowed to present
fully his defenses, with a complete rendition of his own state of mind
due to the victim's escalating demands and threats and his reaction to
her. **\[ ... \]** We need not and do not reach the issue of whether
appellant's proposed instruction, provided for the first time on appeal,
is either an accurate statement of law or supported by the record in the
case at bench.

***\[ ... \]***

**\*10** [**^\[3\]^**](%5Cl%20%22co_anchor_F32003238230_1%22) Appellant
argues that "Equal treatment of ethnic minority defendants requires that
if certain provocative acts are sufficiently offensive in mainstream
American culture to reduce murder to manslaughter \[citations\], then
certain acts that are equally provocative in appellant's culture should
be treated as equally mitigating." He asks us to decide this as an issue
of first impression. (See *People v. Romero* (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 846,
853-855, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 823 \[finding no error and no prejudice from
excluding proposed testimony of a sociology professor on Hispanic
culture\].) Given the record before us, we do not find that this
particular issue was specifically raised in the trial court and we
decline to address it on appeal.

The judgment is affirmed.

| [ | The jury was instructed on first degree murder, second degree     |
| ^ | murder, and voluntary manslaughter. The parties agreed not to     |
| 5 | instruct on involuntary manslaughter. In reading the              |
| ^ | instructions, the trial court, apparently inadvertently and       |
| ] | without objection by defense counsel, started to instruct on      |
| ( | involuntary manslaughter before retracting that instruction.      |
| # | Appellant contends that the comments made by the court at that    |

[^6]: **^3^** Subsection l(l)(c) of the 1976 version of § 211.031 was
    deleted in 1980 and since then has appeared as subsection l(2)(d) of
    that statute. *See* 1980 Laws of Mo., p. 332. Nonetheless, the
    substance of the subsection has remained a part of § 568.050.1(2)
    under the rule that "a statute may adopt a part or all of another
    statute by a specific and descriptive reference thereto, and the
    effect is the same as if the statute or part thereof adopted had
    been written into the adopting statute.\" *State v. Lloyd,* 320 Mo.
    236, 7 S.W.2d 344, 346 (Mo.1928). This \"'adoption takes the statute
    as it exists at the time of adoption and does not include subsequent
    additions or modifications of the statute so taken unless it does so
    by express intent."' *City of Warrensburg v. Board of Regents,* 562
    S.W.2d 340, 344 (Mo. banc 1978).

[^7]: **^4^** § 562.016.3 reads:

    > \"A person*'acts knowingly',* or with knowledge,
    >
    > \(1\) With respect to his conduct or to attendant circumstances
    > when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that those
    > circumstances exist; or
    >
    > \(2\) With respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware
    > that his conduct is practically certain to cause that result."
    > (Emphasis original).

[^8]: **^5^** Under the Model Penal Code and our Criminal Code, "\[a\]
    person *\'acts recklessly'* \... when he consciously disregards a
    substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that
    a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes a gross
    deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would
    exercise in the situation." (Emphasis original). § 562.-016.4.

[^9]: **^6^** The additional or expanded definition of \"knowingly"
    proposed in § 2.02(7) of the Model Penal Code

    > \"deals with the situation British commentators have denominated
    > 'wilful blindness' or 'connivance,' the case of the actor who is
    > aware of the probable existence of a material fact but does not
    > satisfy himself that it does not in fact exist\.... Whether such
    > cases should be viewed as instances of acting recklessly or
    > knowingly presents a subtle but important question.
    >
    > The draft proposes that the case be viewed as one of acting
    > knowingly when what is involved is a matter of existing fact, but
    > not when what is involved is the result of the defendant's
    > conduct, necessarily a matter of the future at the time of acting.
    > The position reflects what we believe to be the normal policy of
    > criminal enactments which rest liability on acting 'knowingly,' as
    > is so commonly done. The inference of 'knowledge' of an existing
    > fact is usually drawn from proof of notice of substantial
    > probability of its existence, unless the defendant establishes an
    > honest, contrary belief. The draft solidifies this usual result
    > and clarifies the terms in which the issue is submitted to the
    > jury." Model Penal Code § 2.02(7) commentary at 129-30 (Tent.
    > Draft No. 4, 1953).

[^10]: **^7^** This inference is reinforced by looking to other statutes
    found in our Criminal Code which acknowledge the problem of defining
    \"knowingly" with respect to age. *See, e.g.,* § 566.020.

[^11]: **^8^** This distillation of the child's testimony is the most
    favorable to the state. The child's testimony was inconsistent, and
    this inconsistency was not lessened by the prosecutor attempting to
    use prior testimony of the child --- at best, impeaching testimony
    --- as substantive testimony.

[^12]: **^9^** Admittedly, a person in defendant's shoes can easily
    avoid conviction of a crime under § 568.-050 by simply refusing to
    check the age of "dancers\". This result is to be rectified,
    however, by the legislature, not by judicial redefinition of already
    precisely defined statutory language or by improper inferences from
    operative facts.

    The Model Penal Code's expanded definition of "knowingly" attracts
    us by its logic. Apparently, it was not as attractive to our
    legislature for use throughout our Criminal Code.

    Other states protect their minor children by the simple device of
    removing the requirement of \"knowledge" of the child's age as an
    element of the offense. Thus, the New York Penal Code provides:

    > \"Notwithstanding the use of the term 'knowingly' in any provision
    > of this chapter defining an offense in which the age of a child is
    > an element thereof, knowledge by the defendant of the age of such
    > child is not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless
    > expressly so provided, a defense to a prosecution therefor that
    > the defendant did not know the age of the child or believed such
    > age to be the same as or greater than that specified in the
    > statute." N.Y.Penal Law, § 15.20.3 (McKinney 1975).

     

     

     

[^13]: **^1^** All statutory references are to RSMo 1978, unless
    otherwise indicated.

[^14]: **^2^** At the close of the state's case, the court denied
    defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. Defendant then offered
    evidence in her own behalf. By doing so, she waived any objection to
    the court's denial of her motion. *See, e.g., State v. Russell,* 581
    S.W.2d 61, 63 (Mo.App.1979). She did not file a motion for judgment
    of acquittal at the close of the state's case nor did she file a
    motion for a new trial. She, therefore, failed to preserve the issue
    of submis-sibility for appeal. *Id.* at 63. *See also State v.
    Wilhite,* 580 S.W.2d 763, 764 (Mo.App.1979).

[^15]: **^3^** Our emphasis on context and structure bears on the
    threshold decision of whether the statute is ambiguous, and is not
    meant to dilute the rule of lenity, as we later discuss.

     

     

     

[^16]: **^2^** *Breaking Bad* (AMC 2008-13).

[^17]: **^3^** As set forth *infra,* the dissenting Commissioner found
    that the evidence did not support the charges, because \"there was a
    lapse of eight months. And I think that is extraordinary. It is
    unusual and it is not acceptable practice.\"

[^18]: **^4^** In *People* v. *Flannel* (1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 679 \[160
    Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1\], we quoted that passage from *Conley,
    supra,* 64 Cal.2d 310 at page 322, in summarizing the doctrine of
    diminished capacity; we then explained how imperfect
    self-defense---the issue in Flannel--- differed from diminished
    capacity. Not at issue in *Flannel* was the distinction between a
    defendant's awareness of the risk of serious bodily injury and
    awareness of the risk of death.

[^19]: **^5^** In *Williams v. New York,* 337 U. S. 241, 248, we
    observed that "Retribution is no longer the dominant objective of
    the criminal law. Reformation and rehabilitation of offenders have
    become important goals of criminal jurisprudence." We also there
    referred to ". . . a prevalent modern philosophy of penology that
    the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime."
    *Id.,* at 247. Such ends would seem illusory if there were no mental
    element in crime.

[^20]: **^6^ \[ ... \]**

[^21]: **^7^** State court cases are similarly divergent. State courts
    have labelled the following situations as involving legal
    impossibility, and concluded that there could be no attempt: (1) A
    person who accepts goods which he believes to be stolen, but which
    are not in fact stolen, is not guilty of attempting to receive
    stolen goods. *People v. Jaffe,* 1906, 185 N.Y. 497, 78 N.E. 169.
    (2) A person who offers a bribe to one whom he believes to be a
    juror, but who was not a juror, is not guilty of attempting to bribe
    a juror. *State v. Taylor,* 1939, 345 Mo. 325, 133 S.W.2d 336. (3) A
    hunter who shoots a stuffed deer, believing it to be alive, is not
    guilty of attempting to shoot a deer out of season. *State v.
    Guffey,* Mo.App.1953, 262 S.W.2d 152.

    In other apparently analogous situations, courts have concluded that
    the impossibility is factual, and therefore no defense to a charge
    of attempt: (1) A person who fires a gun at a bed, thinking it to be
    occupied by a man, is guilty of attempted murder, even though the
    bed is empty.*State v. Mitchell,* 1902, 170 Mo. 633, 71 S.W. 175.
    (2) A person who possesses a substance thinking it is narcotics, is
    guilty of attempted possession, notwithstanding that the substance
    is in fact talcum powder. *People v. Siu,* 1954, 126 Cal.App.2d 41,
    271 P.2d 575. (3) A person who introduces instruments into a woman
    for the purpose of producing an abortion is guilty of attempting an
    abortion, even though the woman is not pregnant. *People v.
    Cummings,* 1956, 141 Cal.App.2d 193, 296 P.3d 610.

    Other impossibility cases are collected in An-not.,37 A.L.R.3d 375.
    We list these cases not to offer support to our conclusions, but
    rather to illustrate the inconsistency of approach which plagues
    this area of legal theory.

[^22]: **^8^** Exceptions came to include sex offenses, such as rape, in
    which the victim's actual age was determinative despite defendant's
    reasonable belief that .the girl had reached age of consent. Absence
    of intent also involves such considerations as lack of understanding
    because of insanity, subnormal mentality, or infancy, lack of
    volition due to some actual compulsion, or that inferred from
    doctrines of coverture. Most extensive inroads upon the -requirement
    of intention, however, are offenses of negligence, such as
    involuntary .manslaughter or criminal negligence and the whole range
    of crimes arising from omission of duty. Cf. *Commonwealth* v.
    *Welansky,* 316 Mass. 383, 55 N.E. 2d 902 (1944).

[^23]: **^9^** Holmes, The Common Law, considers intent in the chapter
    on The Criminal Law, and earlier makes the pithy observation: "Even
    a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked."

    out that in American law *"mens rea* is not so readily constituted
    from any wrongful act" as elsewhere.

[^24]: **^10^** In the *Balint* case, Chief Justice Taft recognized this
    but rather overstated it by making no allowance for exceptions such
    as those mentioned in n. 8.

[^25]: **^11^** This trend and its causes, advantages and dangers have
    been considered by Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Col. L. Rev.
    55; Hall, Prolegomena to a Science of Criminal Law, 89 U. of Pa. L.
    Rev. 549; Hall, Interrelations of Criminal Law and Torts, 43 Col. L.
    Rev. 753, 967.

[^26]: **^12^** The changes in English law are illustrated by Nineteenth
    Century English cases. ■ In 1814, it was held that one could not be
    convicted of selling impure foods unless he was aware of the
    impurities. *Rex* v. *Dixon,* 3 M. & S. 11 (K. B. 1814). However,
    thirty-two years later, in an action to enforce a statutory
    forfeiture for possession of adulterated tobacco, the respondent was
    held liable even though he had no knowledge of, or cause to suspect,
    the adulteration. Countering respondent's arguments, Baron Parke
    said, "It is very true that in particular instances it may produce
    mischief, because an innocent man may suffer from his want of care
    in not examining the tobacco he has received, and not taking a
    warranty; but the public inconvenience would be much greater, if in
    every case.the officers were obliged to prove knowledge. They would
    be very seldom able to do so." . *Regina* v. *Woodrow,* 15 M. & W.
    404, 417 (Exch. 1846). Convenience of the prosecution thus emerged
    as a rationale. In 1866, a quarry owner was held liable for. the
    nuisance caused by his workmen dumping refuse into a river, in spite
    of his plea that he played no active part in the management of the
    business and knew nothing about the dumping involved. His knowledge
    or lack of it was deemed irrelevant. *Regina* v. *Stephens,* L. R. 1
    Q. B. 702 (1866). Bishop, referring to this decision, says, "The
    doctrine of this English case may almost be deemed new in the
    crminal law \.... And, properly limited, the doctrinéis eminently
    worthy to be followed hereafter." 1 Bishop, New Criminal Law (8th
    ed. 1892), § 1076. After these decisions, statutes prohibiting the
    sale of impure or adulterated food were enacted. Adulteration of
    Food Act (35 & 36 Vict., c. 74, § 2 (1872)); Sale of Food and Drugs
    Act of 1875 (38 & 39 Vict., c. 63). A conviction under the former
    was sustained in a holding that no guilty knowledge or intent need
    be proved in a prosecution for the sale of adulterated butter,
    *Fitzpatrick* v. *Kelly,* L. &. 8 Q. B. 337 (1873), and in *Betts*
    v. *Armstead,* L. R. 20 Q. B. D. 771 (1888), involving the latter
    statute, it was held that there .was no need for a showing that the
    accused had knowledge that his product did not measure up to the
    statutory specifications.

[^27]: **^13^** The development of strict criminal liability regardless
    of intent has been roughly paralleled by an evolution of a strict
    civil liability for consequences regardless of fault in certain
    relationships, as shown by Workmen's Compensation Acts, and by
    vicarious liability for fault of others as evidenced by various
    Motor Vehicle Acts.

[^28]: **^14^** Consequences of a general abolition of intent as an
    ingredient of serious crimes have aroused the concern of responsible
    and disinterested students of penology. Of course, they would not
    justify judicial disregard of a clear command to that effect from
    Congress, but they do admonish us to caution in assuming that
    Congress, without clear expression, intends in any instance to do
    so.

    Radin, Intent, Criminal, 8 Encyc. Soc. Sci. 126, 130, says, ". . .
    as long as in popular belief intention and the freedom of the will
    are taken as axiomatic, no penal system that negates the mental
    element can find general acceptance. It is vital to retain public
    support of methods of dealing with crime." Again, "The question of
    criminal intent will probably always have something of an academic
    taint; Nevertheless, the fact remains that the determination of the
    boundary between intent and negligence spells freedom or
    condemnation for thousands of individuals. The watchfulness of the
    jurist justifies itself at present in its insistence upon the
    examination óf the mind of each individual offender." A

    Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Col. L. Rev. 55, 56, says: "To
    inflict substantial punishment upon one who is morally entirely
    innocent, who caused injury through reasonable mistake or pure
    accident, would so outrage the feelings of the community as to
    nullify its own enforcement."

    Hall, Prolegomena to a Science of Criminal Law, 89 U. of Pa. L. Rev.
    549, 569, appears somewhat less disturbed by the trend, if properly
    limited, but, as to so-called public welfare crimes, suggests that
    "There is no reason to continue to believe that the present mode of
    dealing with these offenses is the best solution obtainable, or that
    we must be content with this sacrifice of established
    principles.*The raising of a presumption of knowledge* might- *be an
    improvement."* (Italics added.)

    In*Felton* v. *United States,* 96 U. S. 699, 703, the Court said,
    "But the law at the same time is not so unreasonable as to attach
    culpability, and consequently to impose punishment, where there is
    no intention to evade its provisions . . . ."

[^31]: **^3^** Instruction No. 4.35 in the fourth edition of California
    Jury Instructions---Criminal, relating to ignorance or mistake of
    fact, reads as follows: "An act committed or an omission made under
    an ignorance or mistake of fact which disproves any criminal intent
    is not a crime.

    "Thus a person is not guilty of a crime if he commits an act or
    omits to act under an honest and reasonable belief in the existence
    of certain facts and circumstances which, if true, would make such
    act or omission lawful." The use note for this instruction omits the
    caveat found under instruction No. 4.36, relating to ignorance or
    mistake of law, to the effect that the instruction would be
    inappropriate if the mistake may negative a specific intent or other
    mental state which the crime requires. We think trial judges would
    be well advised also to eschew or modify instruciton No. 4.35 in
    cases involving crimes requiring a specific intent or mental state.

     

     

     

[^32]: **^6^** Nothing in this opinion should be interpreted as
    precluding the Liquor Board from imposing a strict liability

[^33]: **^2^** 18 U. S. C. § 641, so far as pertinent, reads:

    "Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his
    use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or
    disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the
    Unitéd States or of any department or agency thereof, or any
    property 'made or being made under contract for the United States or
    any department or agency thereof;

    "Shall be fined not more than \$10,000 or imprisoned not more than
    ten years, or both; but if the value of such property does not
    exceed the sum of \$100, he shall be fined not. more than \$1,000 or
    imprisoned not more\' than one year, or both."

[^34]: **^3^** The trial court ruled that letters written by or
    addressed to codefendant Noel were admissible against defendant
    Knoller, and vice versa, on a theory that raising the Presa Canario
    dogs was a joint enterprise. The Court of Appeal rejected
    defendants' challenge to this ruling. Both defendants raised the
    issue in their respective petitions for review. We denied Noel's
    petition, and in granting Knoller's petition we limited review to
    other issues.

[^40]: **^3^** The statute thus reads in pertinent part: "If a parent of
    a minor child willfully omits, without lawful excuse, to furnish
    necessary clothing, food, shelter or medical attendance, or other
    remedial care for his or her child, he or she is guilty of a
    misdemeanor . . . . \[ffl If a parent provides a minor with
    treatment by spiritual means through prayer alone in accordance with
    the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious
    denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner thereof, such
    treatment shall constitute 'other remedial care', as used in this
    section."

[^42]: **^8^** Section 192(b) defines involuntary manslaughter as the
    unlawful killing of a human being without malice "in the commission
    of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony; or in the commission of
    a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or
    without due caution or circumspection." The information charging
    defendant with manslaughter alleges that she killed her daughter
    "without malice but in the commission of a lawful act which might
    produce death in an unlawful manner and without due caution and
    circumspection."

[^50]: **^2^** Our order limiting the issues referred to "great bodily
    injury," but the Court of Appeal decision referred to "serious
    bodily injury." The two terms are " 'essentially equivalent' "
    *(People* v. *Burroughs* (1984) 35 Cal.3d 824, 831 \[201 Cal.Rptr.
    319, 678 P.2d 894\]), and although there are some differences in the
    statutory definitions (compare § 243, subd. (f)(4) \[defining
    "serious bodily injury"\] with § 12022.7, subd. (f) \[defining
    "great bodily injury"\]), those differences are immaterial here.

[^51]: **^3^** This decision is limited to the facts of this case; we do
    not specifically adopt any of the examples set forth in § 5.01(2) of
    the Model Penal Code, but simply agree with the reasoning underlying
    subsections (e) and (f). However, we do note that several courts
    charged with the responsibility of defining \"substantial step" have
    adopted or applied the examples in the Model Penal Code. *See State

    conclusion.

[^53]: **^5^** The existence of \"the VIP\" appears to be the only
    contested factual finding. In his testimony, Kougl denied that a
    \"VIP room" existed at Club Harem. According to Det. Jackson,
    however, Brickhouse never referred to a room, but rather stated that
    she and Det. Jackson could \"go up to the VIP." Brickhouse could
    have been referring to the employees\' dressing room or Kougl\'s
    offices, both of which are located \"upstairs" at Club Harem.

[^55]: **^1^** Members of the Church "believe that disease is a physical
    manifestation of errors of the mind." (Comment, *Religious Beliefs
    and the Criminal Justice System: Some Problems of the Faith Healer*
    (1975) 8 Loyola L.A. L.Rev. 396, 397, fn. 7.) The use of medicine is
    believed to perpetuate such error and is therefore discouraged.
    (Schneider, *Christian Science and the Law: Room for Compromise?*
    (1965) 1 Colum. J.L. & Soc. Probs. 81, 87-88.) Nonetheless, "the
    Church sets up no abstract criteria for determining what diseases or
    injuries should be treated by prayer or other methods but, rather,
    leaves such questions to individual decision in concrete instances.
    \... If some turn in what they think is an urgent time of need to
    medical treatment for themselves or their children, they are
    not---contrary to some recent charges--- stigmatized by their
    church." (Talbot, *The Position of the Christian Science Church*

[^56]: **^2^** The Church describes in an amicus curiae brief the role
    of Christian Science practitioners and nurses: "\[Christian Science
    practitioners are\] individuals who devote their full time to
    healing through prayer, or spiritual treatment. These individuals
    are approved for listing by the Church in *The Christian Science
    Journal,* after having given evidence of moral character and healing
    ability. Practitioners determine their own charges, usually from
    seven to fifteen dollars per day of treatment, and are paid by their
    patients. . . . The practitioner's work, however, is a religious
    vocation, a ministry of spiritual healing in its broadest sense.
    \[j\[\] Christian Scientists may also call upon the services of a
    Christian Science nurse, who provides such practical care as
    dressing of wounds for those having spiritual treatment."

[^62]: **^1^** Although the trial judge told the jury that his
    instructions concerning the crime of attempted murder in the first
    degree were advisory, both attorneys agreed, and argued to the jury,
    that if the offense existed in this State a specific intent to kill
    was an essential element of the offense. Bruce's attorney took
    advantage of the advisory nature of the instruction to argue that
    the crime of \"attempted felony murder" does not exist. The argument
    relating to this offense actually bore on the question of whether
    the shooting was accidental or intentional. The jury's verdict
    necessarily evidences a finding that the requisite specific intent
    to kill was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

    Tit. 21, U.S.C. § 841(a) (1).

    Under subsection 802(11) the term "distribute" means "to deliver
    (other than by administering or dispensing) a controlled substance."
    Subsection 802(8) defines the terms "deliver" or "delivery" to mean

[^64]: **^3^** The prosecution's motion to add a count of attempted
    third-degree criminal sexual conduct was denied by the district
    court.

    Additionally, although the original information charged defendant
    with the*completed* offense of distribution of obscene material to a
    minor, the circuit court subsequently granted the prosecution's
    motion to amend the charge to *attempted* distribution of obscene
    material to a minor.

[^65]: **^4^** The Court of Appeals concluded that, because the child
    sexually abusive activity statute proscribes mere *preparation* to
    engage in such activity, the circuit court erred in dismissing that
    charge on the basis of the doctrine of legal impossibility. 241 Mich
    App 102, 115-117; 614 NW2d 674 (2000). We denied defendant's
    application for leave to appeal from this portion of the Court of
    Appeals opinion, and this charge is not presently before us.

[^66]: **^5^** For trial courts too, the better practice in the future

[^72]: **^2^** This conclusion was drawn long ago by Judge Learned Hand,
    who stated that "the decisions \[addressing when preparation has
    become attempt\] are too numerous to cite, and would not be much
    help anyway, for there is, and obviously can be, no definite line.''
    *U.S. v. Coplon,* 185 F.2d 629, 633 (2d Cir.1950). Interestingly,
    Judge Hand also rejected the defendant's argument that no attempt
    responsibility attached until the moment of consummation of the
    criminal act, stating that "\[t\]o divide 'attempt' from
    'preparation' by the very instant of consummation would be to revert
    to the old \[rejected English\] doctrine." *Id.*

[^73]: **^3^** Common law is "the body of those principles and rules of
    action, relating to the government and security of persons and
    property, which derive their authority solely from usages and
    customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees
    of the courts recognizing, affirming, and enforcing such usages and
    customs \.... In general, it is a body of law that develops and
    derives through judicial decisions, as distinguished from
    legislative enactments." Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 276.

[^74]: **^4^** See also *People v Genoa,* 188 Mich App 461, 464; 470
    NW2d 447 (1991). *Genoa* held that the circuit court correctly
    dismissed the charge of attempted possession with intent to deliver
    650 grams or more of cocaine. Judge Shepherd based the holding on
    the fact that it was legally impossible for the defendant to have
    committed the offense.

[^75]: **^5^** This comment to the Model Penal Code catalogues a number
    of formulations which have been adopted or suggested, including the
    following:

    \(a\) The physical proximity doctrine --- the overt act required for
    an attempt must be proximate to the completed crime, or directly
    tending toward the completion of the crime, or must amount to the
    commencement ■of the consummation.

    \(b\) The dangerous proximity doctrine --- a test given impetus by
    Mr. Justice Holmes whereby the greater the gravity and probability
    of the offense, and the nearer the act to the crime, the stronger is
    the case for calling the act an attempt.

    \(c\) The indispensable element test --- -a variation of the
    proximity tests which emphasizes any indispensable aspect of the
    criminal endeavor over which the actor has not yet acquired control.

    \(d\) The probable desistance test --- the conduct constitutes an
    attempt if, in the ordinary and natural course of events, without
    interruption from an outside source, -it will result in the crime
    intended.

    \(e\) The abnormal step approach --- an attempt is a step toward
    crime which goes beyond the point where the normal citizen would
    think better of his conduct and desist.

    \(f\) The res ipsa loquitur or unequivocality test --- an attempt is
    committed when the actor's conduct manifests an intent to commit a
    crime.

    As noted above, the defendant must also have acted in the belief
    that the reasonably foreseeable harm resulting from the violation
    would be less than the harm resulting from compliance with the law.
    However, here the defendant's belief is not by itself sufficient. An
    objective determination must be made as to whether the defendant's
    value judgment was correct, given the facts as he reasonably
    perceived them. W. LaFave & A. Scott,*supra* § 50 at 386-87; Tiffany
    & Anderson, *supra* note 5, at 871. The majority of jurisdictions
    appear to hold that this determination must be made, at least
    initially, by the court. Tiffany & Anderson, *supra* note 5, at
    871-72.

[^77]: **^7^** We would, of course, conclude otherwise had the evidence
    shown, for example, that V.T. had suggested to his two friends that
    they go rob the apartment, that he had pointed out where the
    camcorder was kept, that he had helped carry the stolen goods out,
    or that he helped select the pawn shop at which to sell the
    camcorder.

[^78]: **^8^** This distinction is easily illustrated. If A takes a book
    which he thinks belongs to B, his desire or expectation is criminal.
    However, if the book turns out to belong to A, A does not have the
    requisite intent to be guilty of a criminal attempt, for his intent
    is to take the book, and it is not criminal to take one's own book.

    impossibility by legislative enactment. Brodie, *The obviously

[^93]: **^4^** The drafters of the Code also considered simply
    recognizing voluntary abandonment as an act in mitigation of the
    crime of attempt. However, they concluded that complete exoneration
    would offer the only meaningful inducement to desist, especially in
    light of the already substantially diminished penalties for attempt
    vis a vis those provided for the successful completion of the
    criminal act.

[^94]: **^5^** In our order, we specifically directed the parties to
    address (1) whether legal impossibility is a viable defense under
    the circumstances of this case, and (2) whether the attempt statute

    of attempt.

[^96]: **^2^** Defendant at one point asked Bekka, "Ain't I a lil

    "\[Y\]ou like us old guys?" Bekka explained that boys her age "act
    like little kids," and reiterated that she was fourteen years old.
    Bekka mentioned that her birthday was in 1984 and that she was in
    ninth grade, and defendant asked when she would be fifteen.
    Defendant asked whether Bekka was still "pure," to which Bekka
    responded that she was not, but that she did not have a lot of
    experience and that she was nervous.

[^97]: **^3^** The Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, § 1107, 18 P.S. §
    5707, provided that the jury could not acquit if it found that the
    defendant, "did not complete the offense charged, but was guilty
    only of an attempt to commit that crime. . . ." The statute did not
    define an attempt nor list any affirmative defenses thereto.

[^99]: **^2^** I take this to mean that with respect to conspiracy to
    abort, as with most other statutory crimes, the Legislature has not
    indicated that impossibility is not a defense. Hence, it *is* a
    defense.

[^102]: **^3^** Because defendant was convicted on Counts 15 and 16 for
    "knowingly inducting\] or *attempting\] to induce* a witness or a
    person the person believes may be called as a witness in any
    official proceeding to offer false testimony or unlawfully withhold
    any testimony," his witness-tampering convictions also required that
    his conduct constitute a substantial step toward that result. ORS

[^103]: **^4^** In enacting this statute, the Oregon Criminal Law
    Revision Commission's commentary cites to the Model Penal Code's
    rationale, namely that,

    > "(1) criminal purpose has been clearly demonstrated, (2) the actor
    > has gone as far as he could in implementing that purpose, and (3)
    > as a result, the actor's 'dangerousness' is plainly manifested."

    Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon
    Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report § 55, 53 (July 1970) (quoting
    Model Penal Code § 5.01 comment 31 (Tentative Draft No 10 1960)).

[^104]: **^1^** The csc-m statute provides, in pertinent part, that
    "\[a\] person is guilty of \[csc-iii\] if the person engages in
    sexual penetration with another person and . . . \[t\]hat other
    person is at least 13 years of age and under 16 years of age." MCL
    750.520d(l)(a). As one would expect, this language is phrased so as
    to impose criminal liability on an adult who engages in sexual
    penetration with a child aged thirteen to fifteen without imposing
    liability on the child victim of the crime.

[^105]: **^2^** Professor White further points out that the new Crimes
    Code, Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, §1 et seq.; 18
    Pa.C.S. §901 overrules the holding in *Willard.* Section 901(a)
    defines an attempt as "any act which constitutes a substantial step
    toward the commission of that crime." Section 901(c), however,
    provides that a crime may he "abandoned" as long as the abandonment
    was sufficient to prevent the commission of the crime and is
    complete and voluntary.

[^106]: **^3^** Many other states do require, as an element of proof of
    the crime, that an overt act in pursuance of the conspiratorial end
    be taken. See Model Penal Code, § 5.03, Appendix A, p 156 (Tentative
    Draft No 10). The overt-act requirement tends to be relatively easy
    to meet; virtually any act, no matter how insignificant, may
    suffice. See Model Penal Code, Comment, § 5.03, pp 96-97 (Tentative
    Draft No 10).

[^107]: **^3^** The provision of Penal Code section 189, making all
    murders "perpetrated by means of discharging a firearm from a motor
    vehicle, intentionally at another person outside of the vehicle with
    the intent to inflict death" murders of the first degree, was added
    after commission of the crimes in this case (see Stats. 1993, ch.
    611, § 4.5, eff. Oct. 1, 1993, operative Jan. 1, 1994) and thus does
    not apply herein.

[^110]: **^3^** It is evident that the mental state required for the
    crime of murder*of the first degree* does not entail intent to kill.
    Penal Code section 189, which is quoted in the text, demonstrates
    the point. It incorporates the common law doctrine of first degree
    felony murder, under which intent to kill is immaterial. It is also
    evident that the mental state required for the crime of murder *of
    the second degree* does not entail intent to kill. The requisite
    mental state is malice aforethought---for which intent to kill is
    neither necessary nor sufficient. (See fn. 2, *ante.)*

    The declaration in Penal Code section 189, that all murder that is
    "perpetrated by means of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle,
    intentionally at another person outside of the vehicle with the
    intent to inflict death," is "murder of the first degree," was added
    after the occurrence of the events with which we are concerned in
    this cause (Stats. 1993, ch. 611, § 4.5, eff. Oct. 1, 1993,
    operative Jan. 1, 1994), and hence is not applicable thereto.

    to commit a crime, or at agreement coupled with an overt act which
    may, however, be of very small significance," and "thus reaches

    Defendant's arguments on appeal relate only to the attempted murder,
    attempted aggravated murder, and witness-tampering counts; he does
    not challenge the verdicts on the solicitation counts.

[^120]: **^2^** Of course unreasonable self-defense or a heat of passion
    defense can further reduce an intentional killing to voluntary
    manslaughter.

[^121]: **^1^** As Witkin summarizes it: "\[t\]he elements \[of

    and (e) overt act. . . ." (1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d
    ed. 1988) Elements of Crime, § 156, p. 174.)

[^122]: **^2^** It is evident that the mental state required for the
    crime of murder is malice aforethought. Intent to kill is
    not*necessary* for malice aforethought. Penal Code section 188,
    which is quoted in the text, demonstrates the point. It is satisfied
    by the presence of an "abandoned and malignant heart" or the absence
    of "considerable provocation." Furthermore, intent to kill is not
    *sufficient* for malice aforethought. Penal Code 188 demonstrates
    this point as well. It also requires "unlawfulness\]." *(In re
    Christian S.* (1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 778 \[30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872
    P.2d 574\], italics omitted; see Pen. Code, § 196 \[providing that

[^123]: **^1^** In the course of my analysis, I go beyond that of the
    majority. I do so in order to provide guidance as to issues,
    including double jeopardy, that are likely to arise on remand. We
    have often followed this path. (E.g.,*People* v. *Wilson* (1992) 3
    Cal.4th 926, 930, 937-943 \[13 Cal.Rptr.2d 259, 838 P.2d 1212\];

    Cal.3d 142, 167-188 \[158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587\] (plur. opn.

    \[appellate\] court shall pass upon and determine all the questions
    of law involved in the case, presented upon . . . appeal, and
    necessary to the final determination of the case"\].) I will not
    deviate in this instance. The issues in question are fully ripe for
    decision. They should not be passed over and allowed to cause
    mischief. Not long ago, in another cause, we pretermitted a double
    jeopardy issue (see *People* v. *Marks, supra,* 45 Cal.3d at p.
    1344), only to produce three years of unnecessary litigation in the
    superior court, the Court of Appeal, and this court (see *People* v.
    *Superior Court (Marks)* (1991) 1 Cal.4th 56, 62-63 \[2 Cal.Rptr.2d

    the same result, in this matter.

[^124]: **^2^** In his dissent in*Horn, supra,* 12 Cal.3d 290, 304,
    however, Justice Mosk did recognize conspiracy to commit second
    degree murder as a separate crime in "those instances when the
    planned method of killing falls within the Penal Code section 189
    definition of murder in the second degree." *(Ibid.* (dis. opn. of

[^126]: **^1^** For purposes of this discussion, I include within the
    term "willful, deliberate and premeditated" the methods of killing
    designated in Penal Code section 189 that serve to elevate a killing
    to first degree murder. At the time of this case, those methods were
    killing "by means of a destructive device or explosive, knowing use
    of ammunition designed primarily to penetrate metal or armor,
    poison, lying in wait, \[or\] torture."*(Ibid.)* Moreover, as a
    practical matter, a conspiracy to kill by one of these methods
    almost inevitably will involve deliberation and premeditation.
    Because it is not at issue in this case, I do not address whether
    conspiracy to commit first degree murder is a possible crime in
    cases in which the first degree murder theory would be felony
    murder, rather than deliberation and premeditation. Presumably, if
    it is possible for a defendant to be convicted of conspiracy to
    commit first degree murder on a felony-murder theory, under today's
    holding the prosecution would have to prove intent to kill, even
    though it is not an element of first degree felony murder.

[^186]: **^21^** Sayre points out that in criminal syndicalism or
    sedition eases, where the pressure to convict is strong, it has been
    accomplished by dispensing with the element of intent, in some
    instances by analogy with the public welfare offense. Examples are
    *State* v. *Hennessy,* 114 Wash. 351, 195 P. 211; *People* v.
    *Ruthenberg,* 229 Mich. 315, 201 N. W. 358; *State* v. *Kahn,* 56
    Mont. 108, 182 P. 107; *State* v. *Smith,* 57 Mont. 563, 190 P. 107.
    Compare *People v. McClennegen,* 195 Cal. 445, 234 P. 91. This
    although intent is of the very essence of offenses based on
    disloyalty. Cf. *Cramer* v. *United States,* 325 U. S. 1; *Haupt* v.
    *United States,* 330 U. S. 631, where innocence of intention will
    defeat a charge even of treason.

[^192]: **^28^** The Reviser's Note to 18 U. S. C. § 641 states that it
    is derived from 18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) §§ 82, 87, 100, and 101
    which, in turn, are from Rev. Stat. §§ 5438 and 5439. We shall
    consider only the 1940 code, sections and their interpretations.

    18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 82 reads:

    "Whoéver shall take and carry away or take for his use, or for the
    use of another, with- intent to steal or purloin . . . any property
    of the United States . . . shall be punished as follows . . . ."

    In*United States* v. *Anderson,* 45 F. Supp. 943, a prosecution for
    conspiracy to violate that section, District Judge Yankwich said:

    "It has been before the courts in very few cases. But such courts as
    have had cases under it, including our own Ninth Circuit Court of
    Appeals, have held that the object of the section is to introduce
    the crime of larceny into the Federal Criminal Code.

    "In Frach v. Mass, 9 Cir., 1939,106 F. 2d 820, 821, we find these
    words: 'Larceny of property of the United States is made a crime by
    18 U. S. C. A. § 82.'

    "This means of course, that in interpreting the statute, we may
    apply the principles governing the common law crime of larceny, as
    interpreted by the courts of various states."45 F. Supp. at 945.

    *United States*v. *Trinder,* 1 F. Supp. 659, was a prosecution of a
    group of boys, under § 82, for "stealing" a government automobile.
    They had taken it for.a joy ride without permission, fully intending
    to return it when they were through.. Their plans went awry when
    the.auto came to grief against a telephone pole. In dismissing the
    complaint, the District Judge said:

    "Upon principle and authority there was*no* stealing but merely
    trespass; secret borrowing. At common law and likewise by the
    federal statute (18 USCA § 82) adopting common-law terms, stealing
    in general imports larceny; that is, felonious taking and intent to
    permanently deprive the owner of his property." 1 F. Supp. at 660.

    18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 87, entitled "Embezzling arms and stores,"
    provides:

    "Whoever shall steal, embezzle, or knowingly apply to his own use,
    or unlawfully sell, convey, or dispose of, any ordnance, arms,
    ammunition, clothing, subsistence, stores, money, or other property
    of the United States, furnished or to be used for the military or
    naval service, shall be punished as prescribed in sections 80 and
    82-86 of this title."

    No cases appear to have been decided relating to the element of
    intent in the acts proscribed in that section.

    18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 100, "Embezzling public moneys or other
    property," states that:

    "Whoever shall embezzle, steal, or purloin any money, property,
    record, voucher, or valuable thing whatever, of the moneys, goods,
    chattels, records, or property of the United States, shall be fined
    not more than \$5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or
    both."

    The only noted case of consequence is*Crabb* v. *Zerbst,* 99 F. 2d
    562 (C. A. 5th Cir.), to which the dissent below referred at some
    length. The appellant there was convicted of feloniously taking and
    carrying away certain personal property of the United States in
    violation of § 46 of the Criminal Code, 18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 99,
    and had been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He argued that
    the five-year limitation of sentence in 18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 100
    for stealing property of the United States reduced the ten-year
    limitation in § 99 for feloniously taking and carrying away property
    of the United States to five years also.

    The Court of Appeals rejected his argument, holding that the crime
    of "stealing" in § 100 was separate and distinct from the offense
    specified in § 99, on the ground that § 100 was a broadening of the
    common-law crime of larceny to foreclose any avenue by which one
    might, in the process of pleading, escape conviction for one offense
    by proving that he had committed another only a hair's breadth
    different. ■ .

    In the course of its opinion, it advanced the following pertinent
    observations:

    "That felonious taking and carrying away of property which may be
    the subject of the offense constitutes the common law offense of
    larceny cannot be disputed. . . . However, it is doubtful if at
    \>com- • mon law any fixed definition or formula \[as to the meaning
    • of 'larceny'\] was not strained in its application to some of the
    cases clearly constituting the offense. Modern criminal codes treat
    the offense in various ways. Some define thé offense by following
    the old cases and. are merely declaratory of the common law, while
    others have broadened the offense to include offenses previously
    known as embezzlement, false pretenses, and even felonious breaches
    of trust.

    "As pointed out above, the modern tendency is to broaden the offense
    of larceny, by whatever name it may be called, to include such
    related offenses as would tend to complicate prosecutions under
    strict pleading and practice. In some of these statutes the offense
    is denominated 'theft' or 'stealing.' No statute offers a clearer
    example of compromise between the common law and the modern code
    than the two sections here involved. Section 46 \[18 U. S. C. (1940
    ed.) § 99\] deals with robbery and larceny, the description of the
    latter being taken from the common law. Section 47 \[18 U. S. C.
    (1940 ed.) § 100\] denounces the related offenses which might be
    included with those described in section 46 under a code practice
    seeking to avoid the pitfalls of technical pleading. In it the
    offense of embezzlement is included by name,-without definition.
    Then to cover such cases as may shade into larceny, as well as any
    new situation which may arise under changing modern conditions and
    not envisioned under the common law, it\'adds the words*steal or
    \'purloin* \.... Stealing, having no common law definition to
    restrict its meaning as an offense, is commonly used to denote any
    dishonest transaction whereby one person obtains that which
    rightfully belongs to another, and deprives the owner of the rights
    and benefits of ownership, but may or may not involve the element of
    stealth usually attributed to the word *purloin. .* . . Thus, in any
    case involving larceny as defined by the common law, section 46 \[18
    U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 99\] would apply. Where the offense is
    embezzlement, or its nature so doubtful as to\' fall between larceny
    and embezzlement, it may be prosecuted under section 47 \[18 U. S.
    C. (1940 ed.) § 100\]." 99 F. 2d at 564-565.

    The reference in*Crabb* v. *Zerbst* to 18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 99,
    the robbery and larceny statute then operative, suggests examination
    óf its successor in today's code. For purpose of clarification, that
    section states that:

    "Whoever shall rob another of any kind or description of personal
    property belonging to the United States, or shall feloniously take
    and carry away the same, shall be fined not more than \$5,000, or
    imprisoned not more than ten years, or both."

    The Reviser's Note to18 U. S. C. § 641 makes no mention of it as a
    successor to that section. The present robbery statute is 18 U. S.
    C. § 2112, "Personal property of United States," providing that:

    "Whoever robs another of any kind or description of personal
    property belonging to the United States, shall be imprisoned not
    more than fifteen years."

    The Reviser's Note to that section recites that it is derived from §
    99 of the 1940 Code, and "That portion of said section 99 relating
    to felonious taking was omitted as covered by section 641 of this
    title," which makes it clear that, notwithstanding the absence of
    any reference to 18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 99 in the Note to18 U. S.
    C. § 641, the crime of larceny by a felonious taking and carrying
    away has been transported directly from the former into the latter.

    18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 101 is the forerunner of that part of
    present § 641 dealing with receiving stolen property, and has no
    application to the problem at hand.

    The history of § 641 demonstrates that it was to apply to acts which
    constituted larceny or embezzlement at common law and also acts
    which shade .into those crimes but which, most strictly considered,
    might no.t be found to fit their fixed definitions. It is also
    pertinent to note that it renders one subject to its penalty who
    "knowingly Converts to his own use" property of the United States.
    The word "converts" does not appear in any of its predecessors. 18
    U. S. C. (1940 ed.) § 82 is applicable to one who "take\[s\] for-
    his \[own\] use . . . with intent to steal or purloin . . . ." 18 U.
    S. C. (1940 ed.) § 87 uses the words "knowingly apply to his own
    use." Neither 18 U. S. C. (1940 ed.) §§ 99, 100, nor 101 has any
    words resembling "knowingly converts to his own use." The 1948
    Revision was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those
    then in existence. We find no suggestion that a guilty intent was
    not a part of each crime now embodied in § 641.
